It is conveniently located in proximity to world-renowned academic medical centers and Cambridge, downtown Boston and Logan International Airport.With an exceptional suite of amenities, including flexible conference and meeting space, an expansive central lawn and collaboration pods, the campus has been strategically designed to attract and retain top talent and enhance innovation and efficiency. Other attractive features include a casual café, a fitness and wellness center, outdoor biking and walking paths and a vertical farm.Additionally, this December, Alexandria signed a long-term lease for 99,557 RSF with CARGO Therapeutics CRGX at 835 Industrial Road on the Alexandria Center for Life Science – San Carlos mega campus in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Affirm's services were previously available on Walmart's website and at stores nationwide but not at the self-checkout stations, which comprised around 30% of all retail transactions last year."", ""Affirm elaborated that its research has shown more than half of Americans are looking for retailers to offer a BNPL option at checkout. And 76% of consumers would either delay or forego a purchase entirely without the option.

Often referred to as ""forever chemicals,"" PFAS are widely used, long lasting chemicals whose components break down slowly over time.', 'PFAS chemicals are human-made but have become widespread in some water sources across the country and can have potentially harmful effects on human and animal health. Latest estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) monitoring program show that one in four public drinking water systems contain PFAS concentrations at or above minimum reporting levels.1', 'Xylem (NYSE: XYL) is working with municipal and industrial customers to address this challenge, with more than 80 PFAS mitigation installations in the U.S. alone.', 'For example, Stratmoor Hills Water District (SHWD), which oversees a combination of surface and groundwater sources in the foothills of Cheyenne Mountain in Southern Colorado Springs, has deployed selective ion exchange treatment aimed at countering the threat of PFOA and PFOS – two of the most commonly identifiable PFAS compounds of concern. Using selective single-use ion exchange technology, the utility has reduced contaminants to levels below compliance limits and mitigated water quality issues for its customers.', 'In Maine, the Kennebunkport, Kennebunkport & Wells Water District (KKWWD) took a proactive approach when it detected PFAS in one of its system’s supply wells. KKWWD worked with Xylem to deploy a granular activated carbon system that has treated more than 200 million gallons of water to meet the utility’s drinking water treatment goals.', 'Elsewhere in California, the Orange County Water District (OCWD) deployed over 30 liquid-phase media adsorption vessel systems to treat for PFAS, following a change in California law in 2020.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Xylem is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Xylem imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Those assets produce stable cash flows backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. That provides Energy Transfer with predictable cash flow to pay dividends.', 'The MLP typically distributes a little more than half its cash flow to investors. It retains the rest to fund expansion projects and maintain a strong financial profile. Energy Transfer currently has several projects under construction that should start contributing to its cash flow in 2024. On top of that, the company recently made two needle-moving acquisitions. Those growth drivers will give the MLP plenty of fuel to hit its target of growing its already massive payout by 3% to 5% per year. ', 'Clearway Energy owns and operates renewable energy and natural gas power generating facilities. It sells the electricity those assets produce to utilities and corporate buyers under long-term, fixed-rate agreements. Those contracts supply it with predictable cash flows.', ' The company has set a target for growing its already high-yielding payout by 5% to 8% annually, and expects its hikes will land near the upper end of that target range through 2026. It has already secured all the investments and funding needed to achieve that. It cashed in on its thermal business in 2022, giving it funds to recycle into higher-returning renewable energy investments. It has already closed several acquisitions that should power growth in 2024. Meanwhile, it has secured deals to buy several more renewable energy projects that are currently under development, giving it a clear view of how it will position itself to cover the dividend growth it is targeting. ', 'Real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income focuses on commercial real estate. It has a diversified portfolio of properties (primarily retail, industrial, and gaming) being rented out under long-term net leases. That lease structure provides it with steadily rising rental incomes, as the rates often rise each year.', ""The REIT steadily expands its portfolio by investing in additional income-generating real estate. It recently agreed to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty in a $9.3 billion deal, which will boost its adjusted funds from operations by more than 2.5% per share next year. That's over half its targeted annual growth rate of 4% to 5%. The company has lots of ways to continue growing because it has steadily expanded its reach into new property types (data centers and vertical farming), countries (Italy and Ireland), and investment platforms (credit). Its steady growth should enable Realty Income to continue hiking its monthly payouts, something it has done 123 times since its public market listing in 1994. "", 'Brookfield Infrastructure owns a diversified portfolio of infrastructure businesses in the utility, energy midstream, transportation, and data infrastructure industries. These businesses generate steadily rising cash flows backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures that typically feature inflation-linked rate escalation clauses. That gives it the funds to pay a growing dividend. Brookfield has increased its payout for 14 straight years, and at an 8% annualized rate over the last decade. ', 'The company aims to keep increasing its payouts by 5% to 9% annually. Its revenue growth drivers include inflation-linked rate increases, development projects, and acquisitions. Brookfield has secured four needle-moving deals this year (three data center investments and a leading global container leasing company). Those acquisitions should give it the fuel to grow its funds from operations per share at a double-digit-percentage pace again in 2024. ', ""Telecom giant Verizon needs no introduction. It's a leading provider of mobile and broadband services. Those businesses generate tremendous cash flows, giving the company the funds to invest in growing its business (5G), pay a steadily rising dividend, and maintain a strong balance sheet. Verizon delivered its 17th straight annual dividend hike in 2023. "", ""That steady upward trend should continue. The telecom recently passed the peak investment phase for its 5G network, which will free up additional cash flow that it can use for debt reduction. Falling debt and its cost-cutting initiatives should further boost its cash flow. Meanwhile, its 5G investments are driving revenue growth as more customers upgrade to that faster network. Verizon's growing cash flow and falling debt levels will put it in an even better position to continue increasing its dividends in the future."", 'Energy Transfer, Clearway Energy, Realty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Verizon are excellent dividend stocks.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alamos Gold AGI, Galiano Gold GAU and New Gold NGD.', 'Gold seems poised to wrap up 2023 on a solid note, with the current trading price around $2,023 an ounce. The yellow metal has exhibited resilience, registering an 11.5% increase since the beginning of the year, outpacing commodities, bonds and the majority of stock markets.', 'Despite being pitted against record-high interest rates, gold has thrived this year on safe-haven demand triggered by the banking crisis earlier in the year and the ongoing geopolitical instability. After experiencing declines in the preceding two years, 2023 marks a turnaround for gold, highlighting its appeal as a sought-after asset amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties.', 'Analysts anticipate the positive momentum to carry into 2024, with gold prices poised to reach new highs and potentially sustain levels above $2,000 per ounce. This optimistic outlook is attributed to heightened geopolitical uncertainty, a potentially weaker U.S. dollar and prospects of interest rate cuts. Central bank buying is also expected to provide additional support to gold.', 'For those considering investment opportunities, we recommend exploring stocks such as Alamos Gold, Galiano Gold and New Gold.', ""Gold's performance in 2023 has been marked by several notable fluctuations. Starting the year around $1,839 an ounce, gold experienced an upward trend, supported by a weak U.S. dollar and a drop in the U.S 10-year Treasury yield. However, the announcement of the first rate hike by the Federal Reserve on Feb 1 resulted in gold prices dropping to a low of $1,809 an ounce as the dollar and Treasury yields strengthened."", 'In March, amid the banking crisis triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the United States, gold regained prominence, surpassing the $2,000-an-ounce mark.', ""As confidence gradually returned to the banking sector and further rate hikes occurred in May and July, the gains in gold prices moderated. By the end of the third quarter, following the Fed's decision on Sepr 20 to maintain interest rates between 5.25% and 5.5%, gold prices settled around $1,866 an ounce."", 'The fourth quarter saw a breakthrough for gold, spurred by the Oct 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel. The metal gained momentum due to the Israel-Hamas conflict, surpassing the $1,900 mark.Gold peaked at an all-time record of $2,152 an ounce on Dec 4, supported by expectations of interest rate cuts. The metal has gained as the Federal Reserve held rates steady and signaled three rate cuts coming in 2024 and beyond.', 'To sum up, so far, gold prices have ranged from a low of $1,808 an ounce to a high of $2,152, averaging at $1,950.', 'Analysts expect gold prices to be supported above the $2,000-per-ounce level in 2024, driven by expectations of a more accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. This sentiment has been amplified by slowdowns in inflation and a cooling job market. Lower interest rates could lead to a weaker U.S. dollar, making gold more attractive as an investment,', ""The analysts also foresee substantial support for gold prices in the coming year from robust central bank purchases. In the third quarter alone, central banks acquired 337 tons of gold, marking the third-highest quarterly total on record. The World Gold Council's 2023 survey indicates that 24% of central banks plan to increase their gold reserves over the next 12 months. The survey reveals a shift in central banks' sentiments, with a more optimistic view toward gold than the previous surveys, as 62% believe that gold will have a greater share of total reserves than 46% last year."", 'Against a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical instability and major global elections, including those in the United States, EU, India and Taiwan, analysts perceive that investors’ need for portfolio hedges will likely be higher than normal.', ""Additionally, the demand for gold in 2024 is expected to be underpinned by growing interest in jewelry and technology. Demand for physical gold is seasonally higher starting in the later part of the year, aided by the festival and wedding season in India, followed by the Chinese Lunar Year and Valentine's Day. Demand in India has been strong on improving economic momentum and consumer confidence."", 'India and China, which roughly account for 50% of consumer gold demand, will continue to sustain the demand. The use of gold across energy, healthcare and technology is on the rise. Therefore, there will be an eventual demand-supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices, in turn, aiding the industry.', 'We have handpicked three gold-mining stocks, which currently have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a solid growth potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'Alamos Gold: The company produced 399,800 ounces of gold in the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, which puts it on track to deliver record production numbers in 2023. AGI’s efforts to lower costs will help in providing improved margins over the next several years, thereby supporting a strong free cash flow. The company continues to advance on its growth initiatives, including the Phase 3+ Expansion at Island Gold and the Lynn Lake and PDA projects.', 'In August, it reported the results of an updated Feasibility Study for the Lynn Lake project, which suggests higher average annual gold production of 207,000 ounces over the first five years and 176,000 ounces over the initial ten years — a 23% increase from the 2017 study. In May 2023, the company completed the previously announced acquisition of Manitou Gold Inc.

The company is currently tracking to meet the top end of consolidated production guidance for production and all-in-sustaining costs are tracking to the low end of the guided range. The Rainy River mine continues to deliver per plan, with a continued focus on operational discipline, and cost-control and cost-saving initiatives. The New Afton mine has delivered ahead of plans, as mining from B3 continues to perform above expectations.', ""NGD has been advancing with development plans for both assets. Rainy River continues to advance the connection ramp to the underground Main Zone from Intrepid. The company is currently evaluating the opportunity to extend C-Zone with minimal capital investment, which would extend New Afton's mine life, and C-Zone's profile of low operating costs and strong cash flow. The company also reported encouraging drill results and exploration plans for the K-Zone and AI-Southeast gold-copper zones. Continued focus on operational discipline and investment in growth projects will aid growth."", 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Toronto, Canada-based company’s 2024 earnings has been unchanged over the past 60 days. The consensus mark of 6 cents per share indicates a turnaround performance from the loss of 4 cents reported in 2022. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 66.7%, on average.', 'Galiano Gold: The company’s year-to-date gold production is at 102,130 ounces. It expects full-year gold production to come in at the top end of 120,000-130,000 ounces. The Asanko Gold Mine continues to generate significant cash flows through stockpile processing, which has further strengthened its balance sheet. The Abore pit is on track to deliver higher-grade ore to the processing plant by the second quarter of 2024.', 'The company has initiated drilling programs at Abore to convert inferred mineral resources to the indicated mineral resource category. It has completed the first phase of infill drilling of inferred mineral resources at Midras South, with the deposit advancing towards a maiden mineral reserve estimate.', 'At Nkran, GAU has completed a phase 1 mineral resource upgrade and mineral reserve conversion drilling. The company intends to pursue accretive opportunities for growth. It plans to make the Asanko Gold Mine significant in Ghana, and double its annual gold production to 250,000 ounces in 2025.', 'Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Galiano Gold has an expected earnings growth of 500% for the current year.

So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$264. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 1.8% of Marc Benioff's holding."", ""Salesforce insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

To skip the detailed analysis of the AI industry, go directly to the 5 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Hedge Funds.', 'Artificial intelligence (AI) was a market savior in 2023. In 2022, when the Fed aggressively started to increase the interest rates to fight off the 40-year high inflation, most analysts were sure about the US economy going into a recession in 2023. However, they were proven wrong, as AI was like a wrecking ball that demolished all the predictions made by the bears. The S&P 500 is up 24.5% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on December 19. The index owes most of its gains to the “Magnificent 7”, a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett for the top-performing tech stocks listed on the US stock exchange.\xa0', 'As per our previous report, the Magnificent 7 stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), averaged collective gains of 50.65% while the rest of the S&P 493 declined by 2.05% in the first nine months of 2023.', 'Generative AI became the key driver of technology sector growth after the release of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT. After that, several companies came up with their own generative AI tools used for several purposes, including but not limited to, text-to-image and video generation, music creation, and production of campaign ads. The semiconductor company NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the star performer of the market throughout the year as it manufactures and sells products used to power and train generative AI tools. The company’s stock is up 244.36% YTD at the time of writing on December 19. Furthermore, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) also unveiled its new artificial intelligence accelerator, Instinct MI300X. According to the company’s CEO, it is the most advanced accelerator in the industry and is becoming a tough competitor for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s H200 graphic processing unit.', 'While several analysts and experts predict a slowdown or correction in the AI space, the rest of the market is quite positive about its future. One of the main reasons behind this is that AI is revolutionizing most of the industries of the market. The technology is bringing advancements in the automotive industry, which is evident in autonomous driving technology, mainly dependent on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is also disrupting the healthcare segment as it is innovating the processes used for diagnosis and treatment, data management, mental health, and drug discovery. According to Morgan Stanley, AI will account for 10.5% of the healthcare budgets in 2024, almost double from the 2022 levels.', 'Cathie Wood of ARK Invest also keeps a positive sentiment toward the AI sector. Wood’s firm purchased 3.8 million shares of AI-driven drug discovery company Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:RXRX) in mid-November. She believes that AI will be a part of every sector in the future. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), which tracks disruptive technologies, including AI, has gained nearly 73% YTD at the time of writing on December 19. Ark Invest’s Big Ideas 2023 report says:', ""“Computational systems and software that evolve with data can solve intractable problems, automate knowledge work, and accelerate technology’s integration into every economic sector. The adoption of Neural Networks should prove more momentous than the introduction of the internet and create 10s of trillion dollars of value. At scale these systems will require unprecedented computational resources, and AI-specific compute hardware should dominate the Next Gen Cloud datacenters that train and operate AI models. The potential for end-users is clear: a constellation of AI-driven Intelligent Devices that pervade people's lives, changing the way that they spend, work, and play. The adoption of artificial intelligence should transform every sector, impact every business, and catalyze every innovation platform.”"", 'Artificial intelligence is expected to be the fastest-growing industry in the technology sector, reaching a market size of $2.57 trillion by 2032 from $454.12 billion in 2022, registering a compound annual growth rate of 19%. Keeping that in mind, some of the most promising AI stocks according to hedge funds include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

Despite its sizable customer base, we believe ServiceNow still has substantial room to expand spending with existing customers, as most have not fully leveraged its full product suite. We also are encouraged by the company’s strong leadership team and history of innovation which should enable it to continue to expand wallet share. Additionally, despite ongoing investments in growth, ServiceNow continues to drive healthy operating leverage.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110', 'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Here is what it said:', '“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112', 'Adobe Inc.

And it\'s now official. With ""no clear path"" to satisfying regulatory concerns in Europe and the U.K., Adobe is walking away from the Figma tie-up.', ""To be clear, Adobe is going to be absolutely fine. It's still in pole position in all things creative software. But after an epic year of AI-fueled growth comes to a close, Adobe is facing tougher growth comparisons without the inclusion of its hoped-for Figma prize. Is the stock a buy for 2024 anyway?"", ""In September 2022, Adobe said it would acquire Figma for $20 billion, half in new stock and half in cash (much of that cash funded with new debt). It was a sky-high valuation for Figma, which was on track to reach $400 million in annualized sales at the end of 2022, double that of 2021. But with lots of young creators flocking to Figma's collaborative design software, it seemed clear Adobe wanted to purchase Figma to stave off a potential future threat to its creative software empire."", ""I wasn't particularly enthralled with the proposed purchase when the deal was announced, but I decided to hold on to my Adobe stock at that time. A few months later early in 2023, after mulling over the implications of the merger, I decided to sell Adobe. I'm not sorry. I reallocated some of the proceeds into Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), which, just my luck, has outperformed Adobe stock in 2023."", ""At any rate, though Adobe will be just fine without Figma, there could be some lumps ahead. As part of the original deal, Adobe will have to pay a $1 billion acquisition termination fee to Figma. Adobe is good for the cash, but it isn't chump change, either. Adobe had $7.8 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the beginning of December 2023, offset by total debt of $3.6 billion."", 'Adobe is coming off a solid 2023, one in which it outperformed thanks in no small part to its quick rollout of new generative AI tools. Nevertheless, there were headwinds as many of its customers pared back new spending amid uncertain economic times. Full-year revenue gained 10% to $19.4 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) -- both on a GAAP and adjusted basis -- rose 17%.', 'But slower growth (relative to years past when it grew revenue at a high-teens to low 20s percentage rate) is still clearly hitting Adobe right now. For fiscal 2024, management said revenue is expected to increase to as much as $21.5 billion, implying year-over-year sales growth shy of 11%. GAAP and adjusted EPS are expected to rise as much as 17% and 12%, respectively.', ""To be clear, these are solid numbers, boosted by Adobe's high rate of profitability which it uses to repurchase ample amounts of stock. But the valuation is also quite high after all that 2023 AI hype. Shares trade for 42 times the high end of expected 2024 EPS, or 33 times the expected high end of 2024 adjusted EPS."", ""If you own Adobe stock right now, there's no reason to fret. Though the Figma transaction has fallen through, Adobe remains one of the most powerful software companies around. It no doubt has some other tricks up its sleeve to continue its steady and profitable growth. But for those looking at making a buy in 2024, there could be cloud and AI stocks with a better valuation to give a closer look right now.

Looking ahead, there is optimism about ongoing favorable factors, including continued supply improvements and expectations of declining inflation. The year's positive developments highlight the complexity of economic dynamics and the need for adaptive monetary policies."", ""In December, U.S. homebuilder confidence rebounded, reaching a level of 37 compared to the previous month's 34, as per the National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Index, reported Reuters. The rise suggests that the recent decline in interest rates may be positively impacting sales conditions for builders. This improvement follows a period of falling confidence in November, attributed to the challenges posed by the highest borrowing costs in two decades. The recent drop of approximately 50 basis points in mortgage rates over the past month has led to increased builder optimism. The lower rates are attracting potential buyers who had previously felt priced out of the market, contributing to a rise in overall builder confidence. NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey noted the positive trend, stating that the uptick in traffic reflects the renewed interest of buyers who had been hesitant due to affordability concerns. The decline in confidence in November was influenced by rising mortgage rates, compelling builders to reduce prices since the summer in an effort to enhance affordability. After reaching a two-decade high of 7.9% in October, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 7.07% last week. This shift aligns with signals suggesting that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike cycle may be concluding, with potential rate cuts anticipated in 2024. During the recent surge in interest rates, homeowners locked into lower rates were hesitant to sell, prompting prospective buyers to turn to the new construction market. However, as rates surged through October, buyer traffic declined, reaching a low of 21 in November, the lowest reading since December 2022. In December, prospective buyer traffic increased to 24, indicating a positive shift in market dynamics. Although the share of builders reducing prices remained unchanged at 36% in December, tying with the previous month's high, sales conditions saw notable improvements, particularly in the Midwest and South, where both regions experienced a 4-point increase on a monthly basis. This suggests a regional variation in the impact of changing market conditions on builders."", ""On the Asian side, amid uncertainties in Japan's economy and global financial markets, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy, keeping interest rates at -0.1% and adhering to a 1% upper limit for 10-year government bond yields. According to CNBC, this cautious approach, driven by concerns about the fragile economy, was underscored in a policy statement expressing the BOJ's commitment to patient monetary easing. The yen weakened, and the Nikkei 225 rose 1%, while 10-year bond yields remained mostly unchanged. Speculation on unwinding the policy is deferred, with Governor Kazuo Ueda expected to provide guidance after monitoring economic indicators and awaiting spring wage negotiations. Despite previous expectations, the BOJ remains cautious about prematurely unwinding its ultra-loose policy, fearing potential risks to recent economic improvements. Core inflation is projected to stay above 2% through fiscal 2024, supporting the BOJ's commitment to super-accommodative monetary policy and a preference for domestically driven inflation for sustainability."", 'Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., tech stocks such as Adobe Inc.

(NYSE:C) is a prominent player in the banking and financial services sector. Despite the positive outlook conveyed by the upgrade, the market reaction on the day of the announcement was a modest decline, with a price reaction of -0.17 (-0.34%). This nuanced reaction suggests that while the upgrade is indicative of an optimistic long-term view on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) performance, there may be short-term factors or market sentiments influencing the immediate response.', 'Here is what\xa0Silver Beech Capital\xa0has to say about Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Citigroup\xa0(“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.” (Click here to see the full text)', 'Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.10\xa0(+0.59%)', ""On December 18, Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris made a significant upgrade to Snap Inc.

The upgraded outlook from Guggenheim reflects a positive anticipation of the digital advertising landscape in 2024. Morris foresees an overall acceleration in digital advertising demand during this period. The cornerstone of Guggenheim's optimistic stance on Snap Inc.

Not long after, Alphabet debuted its own large language model (LLM) called Bard. Let's just say the initial reaction from Bard was underwhelming, given the chatbot didn't exactly provide accurate answers to basic questions during its public unveiling."", 'Nevertheless, as ChatGPT continued to gain momentum in the public eye, Alphabet doubled down and kept working. Earlier this month, Alphabet unveiled its latest installment in generative AI, called Gemini.', ""Make no mistake about it -- Alphabet's Gemini release is a calculated chess move during otherwise tumultuous times at OpenAI and the potential repercussions for Microsoft.

According to research at Goldman Sachs, generative AI has the potential to increase gross domestic product (GDP) by $7 trillion over the next decade -- a theme that is sparking interest across Wall Street."", ""A couple of months ago, it was revealed that famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman took a sizable stake in Alphabet. During a fireside chat with CNBC's Scott Wapner, Ackman spoke about his bullish thesis on Alphabet. The bottom line is that Ackman is attracted to Alphabet's ecosystem, which stems across Google Search, productivity applications such as Gmail, video website YouTube, and the company's growing cloud business. In his view, Alphabet is uniquely positioned to integrate artificial intelligence across its entire suite of services, thereby becoming invaluable for end users."", ""The obvious undercurrent of Gemini is that it could further boost the demand for Alphabet's various products, making it appear lucrative and validating Ackman's hypothesis. But I'd caution investors to zoom out and really consider the full picture here."", ""Like Alphabet, Microsoft also has a compelling ecosystem. Per the company's latest earnings report, Microsoft experienced more demand for its AI applications than it was expecting. And while OpenAI has helped fuel growth in Microsoft's Azure cloud segment, the real opportunities may just be getting started."", ""Given the tailwinds pushing both Alphabet and Microsoft, I think it's a little early to declare one generative AI application as superior. For investors seriously considering a position in Alphabet, analysis beyond AI potential is required."", ""There are several ways to assess a stock when it comes to valuation. One measure that can be useful is looking at a company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple benchmarked against a set of peers."", ""The chart above illustrates that Alphabet's forward P/E of 23 is the lowest among its Magnificent Seven cohorts. Of note, Microsoft's forward P/E of 33 is well above Alphabet, thereby signaling the markets are applying a premium to the Windows developer."", ""Going beyond forward P/E, the chart below illustrates the company's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio over the last decade. At a multiple of 22.4, Alphabet stock is trading at a massive discount to its 10-year average, and quite close to its low point of 18.1. This looks like yet another sign that the markets are discounting Alphabet stock and its robust business model. In fact, the company's consistent free cash flow generation is what provides Alphabet with the financial flexibility to invest in new growth areas such as AI."", ""Alphabet stock looks quite cheap at its current trading levels, especially compared to its competition. The secular tailwinds fueling artificial intelligence coupled with the company's institutional support are reasons to be optimistic. However, given the company's sheer dominance in its core online advertising business and its contribution to help fund other growth drivers, like the cloud and AI, don't seem to be appreciated. This most likely stems from the fact that some believe ChatGPT will begin replacing Google Search, putting Alphabet in an existential crisis."", ""If the valuation analysis above shows anything, it may imply that the thesis that Microsoft is going to dethrone Alphabet in online search is shortsighted. Given Alphabet is the home of the world's top two most visited websites (Google and YouTube), advertisers are keen to utilize these platforms. And since 2024 is the beginning of a new election cycle, research suggests that it could be a record year for political advertising campaigns -- a theme that should benefit Alphabet greatly."", ""Moreover, it's clear that the addressable market for artificial intelligence is not only large, but still evolving. As applications and use cases multiply, there will likely be several winners. As the stock trades at historically low levels, now could be a unique opportunity to begin dollar-cost averaging into Alphabet.

Joshua Gotbaum and Wilma Liebman – for election to the Starbucks Board of Directors (the ""Board"") at the upcoming 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the ""Annual Meeting"").', 'The SOC is a coalition of labor unions, including the Service Employees International Union (""SEIU""). The SOC-affiliated unions represent more than 2.3 million union members.', 'Today, the SOC stated:', '""Since the SOC made clear its intention to nominate directors for election to Starbucks’ Board at the upcoming Annual Meeting, the Company has issued numerous announcements related to its purported commitment to improving relations with its employees. These have included the formation of a new Board committee, a public letter to Workers United seeking to reengage negotiations and a letter to shareholders regarding the proposal that received majority support at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders asking for a report on Starbucks’ labor practices.', 'While the optimistic view would be to see some of these steps as encouraging, the reality is that we will only be able to judge their significance based on what the current Board does, not what it says.', 'The timing of this flurry of activity is also not a coincidence. While we recognize some of these announcements may have been in the works prior to the Company becoming aware of the SOC’s decision to put forward directors, we believe this level of response, in the aggregate, represents a clear acknowledgment that the Board’s oversight of its human capital strategy has been severely misguided and that even Starbucks recognizes that change is needed.', 'Notably, Starbucks’ own report, released on December 13, 2023, states that the Company did not understand or give consideration to its labor rights commitments in the context of recent organizing. The report repeatedly references Starbucks’ weak governance during the emergence of union organizing activity in 2021 and contains myriad examples of the Company’s actions allegedly taken in opposition to workers’ organizing, which resulted in adverse Administrative Law Judge decisions. Ironically, on the same day as the report’s release, the National Labor Relations Board (""NLRB"") – the federal agency responsible for protecting workers’ rights – issued a complaint alleging that Starbucks unlawfully closed 23 union and non-union stores across the country.2 The NLRB ordered the Company to immediately reopen these stores and make workers whole, among other measures.', 'Since November 2021, the NLRB has issued over 120 complaints against Starbucks, covering about 420 charges of violating federal labor law. We believe the current Board’s failure to properly oversee the Company’s response to these and other human capital-related issues has directly increased operational, legal and reputational risks for Starbucks over the past several years.', 'If Starbucks and its Board are truly serious about repairing the relationship with the Company’s workers and beginning to undo the damage to the value of its brand, the SOC believes our candidates have the experience to help. Our nominees – Maria Echaveste, Hon. Joshua Gotbaum and Wilma Liebman – can bring fresh perspectives and the right experience enhancing human capital management practices, facilitating constructive outcomes for labor issues and successfully engaging with policymakers and regulators. These are the skillsets urgently needed on the Board to help safeguard the best interests of Starbucks’ shareholders, customers and employees. For more on our nominees, including their full biographies, see here.', 'Ultimately, we hope the Board is sincere about wanting to strengthen ‘Starbucks’ governance framework’ and reset its relationship with its employees.3 However, as the Company’s own actions make clear, the status quo is not working.""', 'DISCLAIMER', 'This material does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described herein in any state to any person.

It intends to have 4,000 locations someday, up substantially from its 794 locations as of the third quarter of 2023.', ""Using this long-term goal as a guide and looking at current business trends, investors can try to approximate where Dutch Bros stock will be in 10 years. And this will help determine whether it's a good stock to buy today."", ""In 2022, Dutch Bros opened 133 new locations. And in 2023, it's on pace to open at least 150 new locations. This was good for 25% and 22% respective annual growth."", ""For restaurants growing by opening new locations, maintaining over 20% annual growth is really hard, if not impossible. It's probably better to assume closer to a 10% annual increase in its store count over a decade."", 'At 10% annual growth, Dutch Bros would have just over 2,000 locations in 10 years -- around halfway to its long-term goal. This seems like a possible outcome if things go well.', ""While investors don't know the exact pace of new store openings, Dutch Bros has said that most of its new stores will be company-owned, not franchised. For perspective, roughly 90% of new locations in 2022 and 2023 are owned by the company. This will boost the top line considerably."", ""On its current path, Dutch Bros' growth is unlikely to be limited by its finances. Through the first three quarters of 2023, the company reported operating income of $44 million -- strong profitability while it's simultaneously expanding. Given that these are drive-thru shops, the cost to open a new location is low, relative to larger sit-down chains. Moreover, Dutch Bros is recently debt-free and has roughly $150 million in cash and equivalents."", ""In short, it doesn't cost Dutch Bros much to grow, which allows it to go fast. It has ample resources to fund growth. And it's profitable, meaning it's getting financially stronger. This is all good."", 'To guess a future valuation, consider that Dutch Bros averages about $2 million in sales per location right now. Conservatively assuming this stays the same, the company could have annual revenue of $4 billion if it has 2,000 mostly company-owned locations 10 years from now.', 'More mature competitor Starbucks trades at 3x trailing sales, as of this writing. If Dutch Bros stock traded at that valuation, it could have a market capitalization of over $12 billion -- roughly a sixfold jump from its valuation today. That would almost certainly be a market-beating performance.', ""I don't believe the next decade will be as easy for Dutch Bros as its previous decade. Other small regional drive-thru coffee chains have growth aspirations, too. Moreover, even big players are developing growth plans of their own."", 'For example, Starbucks intends to grow from around 16,300 locations in the U.S. to about 20,000 in the coming years. A big part of its plan includes opening drive-thru-only locations, to add convenience for its customers. This is something to watch, considering Starbucks has 75 million loyalty members worldwide.', ""Additionally, investors can't overlook McDonald's and its new concept CosMc's. This recently launched concept is a beverage-centric chain optimized for drive-thru. If tests are successful, it could expand quickly because McDonald's uses a franchised model and has existing relationships with franchisees. In short order, eager McDonald's franchisees could snap up territories and start building out CosMc's."", ""Starbucks and McDonald's don't necessarily threaten Dutch Bros' existing business today. But they could make it harder to expand at a fast pace a few years down the road."", ""It's not an insurmountable challenge. And Dutch Bros has fans and strengths of its own. Investors just can't take its future success for granted."", 'Dutch Bros stock trades at almost its lowest valuation since going public, which has lowered its risk profile. The company is in a strong financial position and has big growth plans, which should boost the stock price over time.', ""I'm not convinced Dutch Bros is necessarily a market-beating investment idea over the long haul -- competition may make it harder to earn the level of profitability it's hoping for. But the stock price should be higher in 10 years, and the downside risk could be limited."", ""That's not a terrible proposition for those who have been intently watching Dutch Bros stock from the sidelines. Now could be a chance to take a smaller position, understanding the competitive risks ahead. And investors could add to their positions as the stock either gets cheaper or better demonstrates its ability to outcompete its deeper-pocketed rivals in coming years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

Although that\'s a ""grande"" order, so far the upstart seems to be doing fairly well in its expansion efforts. But the real benefit from new stores doesn\'t show up for a little while.', ""Here's why Dutch Bros' business, and likely its stock, could be in a better place in three years."", ""In the third quarter of 2023, Dutch Bros had 794 locations. That's up from 641 in the same quarter of 2022. Do the math on that, and the company opened a whopping 153 stores in a year, growing its store count by nearly 24%. That's incredibly rapid growth, even noting that the coffee chain is coming off a relatively small base. For reference, Starbucks operates well over 16,300 locations in the United States."", ""There's two pieces of good news here. First, given the size of Starbucks, Dutch Bros likely has a material amount of growth ahead of it. Second, the company is executing well on its growth plans."", ""That's worthwhile, given that finding a place to put a new store, building it out, staffing it, and then running it is not an easy task. There is a huge amount of execution risk, especially given how important store count growth is to the company's future. Still, the near-term problem here is that opening stores isn't cheap."", ""To the company's credit, it turned a profit of $0.07 per share in the third quarter. But the profit over the first nine months of 2023 was just $0.05 per share, so black ink appears to be a bit touch-and-go right now. That's not shocking, given the growth phase the company is in. But there's a subtle trend that investors need to get a handle on when thinking about the future."", ""When Dutch Bros first opens a new company-owned location, it tends to have a gross profit margin of negative 29%. That's an ugly figure, but it makes complete sense, given the start-up costs involved in opening new coffee shops."", ""Here's the issue: The more new stores it opens, the bigger the drag on the company's overall performance. That's true even though opening new stores is fueling the company's long-term growth opportunity."", ""But from that initial negative, new stores start to improve dramatically over the next 12 months. After two quarters of operations, gross margin improves to 18%. After four quarters, a full year of operation, the gross margin is 26%. In the third quarter, the company's overall gross margin for owned locations was just under 22%. That gives you an idea of the drag that new stores can cause."", ""But once the base of stores grows, the impact of each new store on the total will be reduced. That's simple math, because more stores open for at least a year will be operating with margins in the 26% range."", ""So, in three years, the company's profitability is likely to trend reliably higher. As it proves that it can turn a profit while still opening new stores, investors are likely to take a more positive view of the future. And Dutch Bros will be a bigger company, too."", 'Is Dutch Bros going to be the next Starbucks? It\'s way too soon to tell. But it appears to be doing reasonably well at expanding its footprint, even though its modest size currently means new store costs eat into the restaurant chain\'s profitability. This dynamic, however, should become less of an issue over the next three years as more and more new stores become ""old"" stores. That suggests a brighter future for the business and, likely, the stock, as well.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

But many boycotters, like Blake, thought Starbucks should offer more support to the people of Gaza.', ""“I understand on a corporate level why they wanted to mitigate that damage, but on the humanity level, it's horrible,” she said. “I personally try to consume and do things in a way that I’m not disregarding other people’s pain when I’m purchasing something.”"", 'In an open letter to employees Tuesday, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan decried the vandalism of stores and escalating protests in the U.S. and abroad.', '“While I am grateful for so much, I am concerned about the state of the world we live in.

Meanwhile, videos posted on X show protests and empty stores in London, Australia, Dubai and elsewhere."", 'Starbucks has also been offering more deals than usual to draw customers, like half-price drinks on Thursdays.', ""In some cases, like the Workers United lawsuit, Starbucks' issues have been self-inflicted. The company refiled the lawsuit in November to add language saying it respected workers' right to express their views on the war in the Middle East and other political issues.

After all, several risk-on asset classes, including technology-focused securities and cryptocurrencies have soared over the past several weeks. However, not all may be well with the equities space, presenting relevance for the staid but reliable investments.', 'Primarily, a risk-on pivot materialized due to speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sometime next year. While anything’s possible, the robust jobs market presents a surprise headwind. Generally, monetary policymakers deploy interest rate cuts during deflationary cycles, not when the labor market is running at full speed. Therefore, utility stocks with dividends make sense.', 'No matter what happens – whether we continue on this bull run or if a black swan event changes everything – people need access to energy and critical resources. In other words, we all must pay the bills. That’s the underlying cynicism bolstering dividend-paying utilities stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Plus, no one’s saying not to speculate. But it’s good to have a parachute, just in case. Below are dividend stocks to consider.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is a powerhouse among utility stocks with dividends. By covering large portions of the Southern California market, Sempra effectively guarantees itself relevance. Sure, investors must watch out for migration trends and all that jazz. However, as a coastal region with ports to the Pacific Ocean and an international border with Mexico, Sempra is in a prime location.', 'Relevance: Right now, the company carries a forward dividend yield of 3.22%. To be fair, that’s a bit lower than the sector average of 3.75%. However, Sempra enjoys 20 years of consecutive payout increases. That’s a status that management will want to hold onto. Further, the payout ratio sits at just under 50%, which is reasonable considering the consistency inherent in dividend-paying utilities stocks.', 'Pros: Analysts appreciate the opportunity, rating Sempra shares a consensus moderate buy. Also, while the average price target is modest at $80.30, the implied 9% upside is decent for a utility.', 'Cons: While it’s boring, that doesn’t always translate to positive performances. So far, SRE is down about 4% year-to-date, which is kinda disappointing for dividend stocks.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated electric utility and natural gas delivery firm. Per its public profile, the company serves more than 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across parts of eight states. With a concentration in the Midwest and western regions of the nation, Xcel benefits from migration trends. More young people are moving to the Midwest for cost-of-living reasons.', 'Relevance: Presently, Xcel offers a forward yield of 3.4%. Again, it’s a bit lower than average dividend stocks in the utilities space. However, Xcel also features 20 years of consecutive payout increases, something that its leadership team will want to keep going as a strong selling point to investors. Further, its payout ratio comes in at 58.14%, which is decent for the predictable utilities space.', 'Pros: Analysts view XEL as a consensus moderate buy. On a fundamental level, Xcel should see increased demand as more people move to areas the utility covers. And because utilities command the natural monopoly tailwind, XEL is a name to watch for the long run.', 'Cons: If you’re looking for big capital gains, XEL isn’t it. Its average price target of $63.64 implies only 4% upside from the time of writing.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Topeka, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, Evergy (NASDAQ:EVRG) is a prime example of investor-owned dividend-paying utility stocks. According to its public profile, Evergy is the largest electric company in Kansas, serving more than 1.7 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Kansas and Missouri. Fundamentally, the company benefits from millennial migration as they seek refuge from the high costs of living in major metropolitan areas.', 'Relevance: One of the most intriguing dividend stocks if you’re focused on the utilities space, Evergy commands a forward yield of 5%. That’s conspicuously above average for the sector. However, you must be prepared to absorb a higher-risk profile given the elevated payout ratio of 67%. Also, the utility lacks an ongoing consecutive track record of rising payouts.', 'Pros: Again, the millennial migration aspect warrants consideration for Evergy. To sweeten the pot, shares trade at forward earnings multiple of 13.27x, lower than the sector median of 14.66x.', 'Cons: At the moment, analysts rate EVRG only as a consensus hold. Also, the average price target of $52.20 implies a measly upside potential of less than 2%.

Some consumers told the DOT that they ""only found out that their flight had been canceled after driving to the airport.""', ""Who among us hasn't had any of this happen to them?"", 'The problems continued when passengers tried to receive refunds for their fares or add-on fees for upgraded boarding, early check-ins or baggage. Although Southwest was required to provide passengers with credit card refunds or transferable travel vouchers, thousands received only nontransferable vouchers. (Southwest eventually replaced these with transferable credits under pressure from the DOT, the agency said.)', ""Refund requests transmitted through the airline's website often fell through the cracks, in part because the system rejected requests with minor errors in the confirmation codes they submitted. Also, Southwest recycled confirmation codes and rejected refund requests with the resulting mismatches of names and confirmation codes."", ""None of that would have had long-lasting consequences, except that Southwest didn't notify passengers that their refund requests had been rejected, so they weren't aware they had to resubmit them."", 'One interesting feature of the DOT order is its observation that by not adequately staffing its customer call center, Southwest caused ""substantial harm to consumers"" that was ""not outweighed by countervailing benefits.""', 'This can be read as a preemptive strike against any effort by Southwest to claim that its failures were the result of ""trying to serve you better,"" that all-purpose corporate explanation for layoffs and cutbacks in customer service departments.', ""Read more: Column: Businesses have been ripping off consumers for 50 years.

This retail REIT behemoth enjoys wide exposure to retail assets across the United States. Additionally, its presence in international markets is likely to encourage sustainable long-term growth compared with its domestically focused peers.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. It is also focused on tapping growth opportunities by helping digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Further, SPG’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work, play, stay and shop. Going forward, an improving leasing environment is likely to benefit this retail REIT’s properties at premium locations. We expect the company’s 2023 total revenues to increase 4.6% on a year-over-year basis.In the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, the company signed 922 new leases and 1,440 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio. This comprised roughly 8.5 million square feet, of which 6.5 million square feet were related to consolidated properties.Also, it has a significant number of leases lined up and continues to see solid broad-based demand from the retail community across several categories. As of Sep 30, 2023, the ending occupancy for the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio was 95.2%, up 70 basis points from 94.5% as of Sep 30, 2022. We project the metric to be 95.4% at year-end 2023.To enhance its portfolio, Simon Property has been focusing on premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments and has invested billions in transforming its properties. Moreover, the company capitalized on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. With the brands generating a decent amount from digital sales, investments in them seem strategic for SPG.Simon Property is making concerted efforts to bolster its financial flexibility. This enabled the company to exit the third quarter of 2023 with $8.8 billion of liquidity. As of Sep 30, 2023, Simon Property’s total secured debt to total assets was 18%, while the fixed-charge coverage ratio was 4.5, ahead of the required level.SPG also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it remains well-poised to tide over any mayhem and bank on growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and Simon Property is committed to boosting shareholder wealth. During the pandemic, while several REITs suspended dividend payments in light of the pandemic that disrupted the macro economy and affected rent collections, Simon Property continued with its dividend payment, though at a reduced rate.Later, the company announced dividend hikes, with the most recent one being declared concurrent with the second quarter of 2023 earnings release, whereby the company increased the dividend payment to $1.90 per share from $1.85 paid out earlier. This marked a hike of 2.7% from the prior dividend payment and a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. This retail REIT has increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years. This spate of dividend increases brings additional relief to investors and reaffirms confidence in this retail landlord.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 26.2% in the past three months, outperforming its industry’s increase of 11.3%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. However, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to continue to be a popular choice among customers. Consequently, this might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and affect retail REITs, including Simon Property.A high interest rate environment is a concern for Simon Property. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its share of total debt as of Sep 30, 2023, was approximately $31.4 billion. Higher interest expenses during the third quarter of 2023 adversely impacted its results by seven cents per share in the year-over-year comparison.Our estimate implies a year-over-year rise of 9.5% in the company’s current-year interest expenses. Moreover, with high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts."", 'Some better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Realty Income O and TANGER INC SKT.

The company has also outperformed its industry’s rise of 10.1% over the same time frame. It has also topped the S&P 500’s roughly 6% rise over the same period.', 'Let’s take a look into the factors behind the stock’s price appreciation.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'PPG Industries, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is benefiting from higher pricing across its segments, manufacturing efficiencies, cost discipline and efforts to grow its business through acquisitions amid headwinds from soft demand in Europe and China.The company is implementing a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy, as well as optimizing its working capital requirements. The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end markets with weak business conditions. The company achieved $15 million in incremental cost reductions through restructuring programs and acquisition synergies in the third quarter of 2023 and expects incremental savings of around $15 million in the fourth quarter.PPG Industries is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance. Acquisitions, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line.Moreover, the company is raising selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of raw material and other cost inflation and drive profitability. Significant progress has been made in increasing consolidated segment margins, which were about 15% in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 260 basis points compared to the same quarter in 2022, aided by strong selling price realization. Pricing measures are likely to continue to support its margins in the fourth quarter.PPG Industries also remains committed to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The company, in July 2023, raised its quarterly dividend by around 5% to 65 cents per share. PPG paid dividends worth $153 million in the third quarter and $445 million during the first nine months of 2023.', 'Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPG for third-quarter 2023 has increased around 2.1%.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the financial technology industry, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Promising Fintech Stocks To Buy.', ""The finance industry is one of the largest in the world. Banks have been working for centuries to manage money and make payments for businesses, and throughout its history, the industry has had to keep up with the times. To understand just how old the finance system is, consider the world's largest private bank in terms of assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JPMorgan traces its history back to the days of the American Revolution, as it was acquired by Chase Manhattan bank in 2000 to become the biggest bank holding company in the U.S. Chase Manhattan itself was initially set up in 1799, making it one of the oldest banks in the world. However, JPMorgan isn't the oldest bank in the world, with one of the oldest financial institutions being Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.\xa0 - a state owned Italian bank that was set up in 1624 and traced its roots back to 1472."", ""The world, if you're unaware, has significantly changed since 1472. Now, banks and financial institutions process thousands of transactions daily and move money thousands of miles across the world. Similarly, companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) have leveraged technology to serve a larger number of people who are covered by the financial system. Banking, like gasoline, is a commodity and the lack of access to a bank account often means that people cannot perform or earn to their full potential. After all, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is unlikely to pay its employees hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in cash, and anyone who cannot open a bank account often misses out on financial opportunities."", ""The intersection of the finance industry and modern day computing technology is dubbed 'fintech'. Short form for financial technology, the fintech sector is simply defined as the use of technology to steal market share away from traditional financial providers when it comes to managing finances for businesses or enabling consumers to spend, save, or earn their money. Naturally, this potential of being able to cater to millions of consumers and businesses means that the right financial technology companies can be quite valuable."", ""As an illustration, consider the consulting firm McKinsey's estimate of the total market value of publicly traded fintech companies as of July 2023. According to the firm, these companies were worth $550 billion, a two fold increase over the four years since 2019. While this figure is quite sizeable on its own, it doesn't represent the full value of the fintech sector since McKinsey adds that fintech unicorns were worth an additional $936 billion for an unbelievable growth from the $1 billion in value just five years back."", 'Yet, just like the broader stock market, the fintech sector is also subject to the whims of the global economy. Venture Capital funding in fintech companies stood at $19.4 billion in 2015 to sit at $33.3 billion in 2020. Just like the coronavirus pandemic saw money flow into technology companies on the back of stronger demand for their products, money also piled into the fintech sector as $92.3 billion was poured into these companies in 2021 as users turned to the digital realm for their financial needs in the wake of lock downs and economic disruption.', 'Similarly, just as other industries are now desperately seeking the integration of artificial intelligence, so is the financial technology industry. So much so that one of the biggest payment platforms and service providers in the world, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently published a report highlighting the ten ways in which GenAI can disrupt the banking and financial sectors. According to Mastercard, these use cases include preventing fraud, bringing new clients on board, issuing credit, managing loyalty programs, enabling the wealthy to manage their money, and offloading some customer support to chat bots.', 'With GenAI being all the hype and technology continuing to break boundaries, we decided to look at the most promising fintech stocks according to hedge funds.

If you want to skip our overview of the electric vehicle industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising EV Stocks According To Hedge Funds. ', 'The 21st century has bred several new industries that have reshaped our way of life. Courtesy of advances in computing and the Internet, communications, entertainment, and work are significantly different in 2023 when compared to just two decades back. Similarly, mass production and industrial engineering coupled with the prowess of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also made electric vehicles quite common.', ""In fact, Tesla's success and the resulting market saturation through products offered by both traditional car manufacturers such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and new electric vehicle companies such as Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) to introduce countless new EVs in the market. This has led to the market blossoming, with data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) showing that 2022 was another record year for the EV industry. This is despite the fact that EV stocks, which are high growth and high risk due to less established manufacturing capacity and less market share, were pummeled as investors fled to safety in a high rate environment and consumers felt the inflationary pinch."", 'Just how record setting was 2022? Well, according to the IEA EV sales grew by 55% in 2022 at a time when the broader automotive industry contracted by 3%. In total, ten million electric cars were sold globally in 2022 - a figure that led to 26 million cars roaming the roads for a 60% annual jump. Within this growth, the most popular electric vehicles were battery EVs, which are those that solely rely on their batteries to power up the car. BEVs accounted for 70% of all the EVs on the road, and the growth was in line with the average historical growth. This is a crucial insight since it shows that the considerable global demand for electric vehicles was sufficiently robust to ensure a quick recovery after the devastation ushered in by the coronavirus pandemic.', ""This robust demand also means that the EV sector is estimated to be one of the fastest growing industries that you're likely to come across. For instance, research shows that the EV market was worth $163 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% to be worth $823 billion by 2030 end. A double digit growth rate is anything that anyone can hope for really, but a key caveat for the EV industry is that even though millions of vehicles are on the roads, there is inadequate charging infrastructure to ensure long trips. Conventional cars have had decades for companies such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) to set up gasoline pumps in nearly every area imaginable. However, the charging infrastructure industry is quite nascent but it is going through some developments that could overcome these constraints."", ""To meet this demand, data from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) outlines that the EV charging infrastructure segment will undergo 'hockey stick' growth where it suddenly peaks. Talking raw numbers, according to PwC, chargers in the U.S. will grow from four million in 2022 to 35 million by 2030 end. For more details on this front, you can check out 11 Best EV Stocks For The Long Term."", ""Charging infrastructure for electric vehicles is in fact the hottest topic in the electric industry right now. 2023 has seen Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) being adopted by EV manufacturers far and wide. As of August 2023, 26 companies have adopted Tesla's NACS and several states have drafted laws to ensure that Tesla's chargers are included in charging stations."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some electric vehicle stocks that are promising according to hedge funds.

So in the regular session that we saw for Lyft here today, we did see, I believe, a dip of about 3.6%. And that's because there were some selling going on here."", 'According to filings, co-founder John Zimmer sold about 3 and 1/2 million dollars worth of shares, and the president of the company also selling a much smaller chunk of shares.

To your point, I mean, despite the drop today, the stock is up nearly 40% this year. It has been a really strong year for Lyft. Dow Jones actually noting, it is on pace here for its best year on record, actually. Not a ton of support on the Street, right? Most are at a hole to cover the name. But we did recently speak with Lyft CEO David Risher here on Yahoo Finance and sounding very confident, very optimistic to talk to us about the company's focus, talked about their focus on ride share, 100% concentrating just riders and drivers, obviously, trying to point a differentiation with Uber as well. But very strong year. If you were long, Lyft in January 2023, you're pretty happy."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, but you might be happier if it's Uber--"", ""JOSH LIPTON: That's true."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Because it was up 150% this year.', 'JOSH LIPTON: And there is different on the Street, too. I mean, analysts pound the table for Uber. So it is different.', ""JULIE HYMAN: So kind of it's all relative. It always is, right?"", 'JOSH LIPTON: Right.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. Finally, here's another name for you. FuelCell Energy falling after reports Q4 earnings miss on revenue and falling pretty hard. They're down about 5%. Company saw 43% decrease from the prior year, saying it was mostly due to lower product revenues. So this one's interesting. We do have the CEO here saying in a press release, we're methodically taking steps to build upon our core capabilities evolve the business, he says, model to achieve. What he talks about is growth, profitability in the future."", ""But investors, obviously, not convinced. Today the stock was down. It's now lost about half its value, down nearly 50% in 2023."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, exactly. And this is, even though the company the stock taking a hit today, it did, yes, have that revenue drop and the revenue missed estimates. This even though the loss actually came in better than estimated. It was a narrower loss than had been estimated for FuelCell. You know, the EBITDA loss, though, was bigger than estimated. So I guess that's what investors were sort of overweighting here."", ""But we're going to talk a little bit more about this later on. And FuelCell is not a solar company per se, but when you look at a renewable energy source company like a FuelCell, not quite universally, but almost universally, we have seen a down year for that type of stock."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, off when you see a move like this move. A lot of analysts will kind of start poking around, kicking the tires, thinking, all right, well, a lot of the bad news is priced in. Not here. I mean, most analysts still on the sidelines even after this kind of drop.""]"

Not only that, but the labor action arrived at a critical inflection point as the introduction of artificial intelligence and rapid rise of streaming threatened Hollywood\'s status quo.', 'Writers were the first to announce a strike on May 2 after the Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents thousands of television and movie writers, failed to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).', 'The AMPTP bargains on behalf of studios including Disney (DIS), Netflix (NLFX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), and Sony (SONY).', 'It was the first time in 15 years that the writers had gone on strike as concerns brought on by the streaming boom deepened. Streaming shows often have fewer episodes and less residual income compared to traditional network television, which often means less money in the pockets of creators.', 'At the same time, the majority of studios are no longer just ""pure play"" production houses. Rather, they have their own streaming divisions, which have brought on a new set of challenges as direct-to-consumer losses mount.', 'In an attempt to stop the bleeding, media giants from Disney to Warner Bros. Discovery enacted mass layoffs and shelved multiple projects amid a massive wave of cost-cutting as Wall Street demanded profitability.', 'The WGA had been fighting for higher compensation, increases to streaming residuals, transparency around viewership data, a guaranteed minimum length of employment, writing room staffing requirements, and further protections surrounding the use of artificial intelligence.', 'Actors, battling similar challenges, joined their fellow writers a few months later, calling for a strike on July 14. It was the first time SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world, had gone on strike in over four decades.', 'At the time, SAG-AFTRA announced its fight would focus on more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go direct to streaming.', ""But it wouldn't be an easy fight with both unions locked in heated, monthslong negotiations with studios."", 'The writers guild was the first to reach a three-year deal, ending a nearly 150-day strike at the end of the September.', 'The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, viewership-based streaming bonuses, more data transparency, higher health and pension contribution rates, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.', 'The guild was also able to achieve a 5% wage increase this year, which will be followed by a 4% jump in 2024 and a 3.5% boost in 2025.', 'Two months later, SAG-AFTRA reached its own conclusion, striking a tentative agreement with studios on Nov. 8 to end an 118-day strike — the longest in its history.', 'The union said the new three-year contract, valued at over $1 billion, includes ""above-pattern"" minimum compensation increases, with a 7% general wage hike that ""breaks the industry pattern,"" according to SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.', 'Those minimum wages will increase by another 4% in 2024 and then by another 3.5% in 2025.

That implies fewer shows and franchises and more limited opportunities for creators as content budgets shrink and the peak TV era comes to an end.', 'On top of that, the box office continues to lag pre-pandemic levels (and might not ever get back to those numbers) while social media sites like TikTok and YouTube have more successfully captured the attention of younger viewers.', 'Still, Hollywood is hard at work to get back on track.

Each of the major market indexes has gained more than 20% from their respective trough. Perhaps more importantly, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are within striking distance of new highs, which will check the final box marking the start of a new bull market.', 'Closing out the old and ringing in the new is a great time for examination, and one of the places I start is with my portfolio. A review of my top investments and how they came to be that way can offer valuable insight for the future.', ""Here's a look at my six largest holdings heading into 2024 (as of the market close on Dec. 15) and the incredibly valuable lesson I learned from each one."", 'Every investor has one -- the ""stock that got away."" The one you meant to buy, only to find that it got away from you and has risen 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. In my case, that stock was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). I had owned a few shares of the graphics processing units (GPU) pioneer in the early days of my investing journey but ultimately sold them in an unprovoked bid of tax-loss harvesting in early 2010.', 'I always meant to buy it back, but the stock price meandered for much of the next five years, and I ultimately lost confidence. Things changed quickly in 2016 when the stock tripled. After that, it just kept getting away from me.', ""Fast forward to early 2018. Nvidia still dominated the discrete desktop GPU space, controlling roughly 70% of the market. The company's graphics cards were the processor of choice for cryptocurrency mining, which was booming. Furthermore, there was an ongoing push toward autonomous driving. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for skating to where the puck was going -- recognizing technology trends on the fly and adapting Nvidia's processors and the accompanying software to meet that need."", 'After much deliberation, I held my nose and bought Nvidia anyway -- even though the stock had risen 600% over the preceding two years. I have added to my stake several times since. Over the past few years, Nvidia has once again adapted to meet a compelling technology need, becoming the gold standard for generative AI applications.', ""Since that initial purchase, Nvidia has soared 768%, and the stock has become my sixth-largest holding, amounting to nearly 6% of my portfolio. The lesson here? It's never too late to buy a quality company, even if the stock has already risen many times over."", ""Long after Amazon had established itself as the world's largest digital retailer, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) came on the scene with a different approach to e-commerce. Shopify's founders, having discovered firsthand the difficulties inherent in starting an online sales platform, pivoted the business from selling snowboards to providing customizable templates and other tools that made setting up and running an e-commerce business a snap."", ""By solving a common problem among digital retailers, Shopify carved out a profitable niche for itself in a market that was already (and still is) dominated by Amazon. While it isn't an exact apples-to-apples comparison, it helps illustrate an age-old truth in investing that I learned from owning this stock -- there's a Pepsi for every Coke."", ""There's another lesson here. I had long been a shareholder of Amazon, but I recognized the value Shopify could bring to the online sales space. Despite the fact that e-commerce was already well represented in my portfolio, I made a sizable investment in Shopify."", 'That decision turned out well, as both companies have continued to prosper in the age of digital retail. It also turned out well for me as an investor. Since my first purchase of Shopify shares, the stock is up more than 1,446%, while Amazon has gained 844%. Shopify and Amazon are my fourth and fifth largest holdings heading into 2024, each representing roughly 6% of my portfolio.', ""There's little question that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most successful companies in history. Yet, at times over the past few years, some investors concluded the company had reached its zenith. Apple reached a market cap of $1 trillion in 2018, so how much higher could it go?"", ""There were other worries. As penetration has risen, global smartphone sales have slowed. Since Apple's flagship product -- the iPhone -- historically generates more than half the company's revenue, investor reservations are understandable."", ""Despite these challenges, Apple has continued to grow. CEO Tim Cook has succeeded in expanding Apple's services business to become the company's second-biggest breadwinner, behind just the iPhone. The segment brought in $85 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), making it comparable to a top 50 company in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, the iPhone continues to dominate where it matters, capturing a record 45% of worldwide smartphone revenue and 85% of profits in the second quarter, according to Counterpoint Research."", ""Fears that Apple simply couldn't go any higher turned out to be unfounded, an important lesson for investors as its market cap has tripled since 2018. Since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged more than 3,400% to become my third-largest position at 8% of my portfolio. I'm confident there's more to come."", ""It's likely that many investors have never heard of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). The company, which began as a local online auction site, has evolved into the largest e-commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, serving 18 countries in the region."", 'MercadoLibre not only provides a marketplace for buyers and sellers but also handles shipping and logistics, warehouse and cross-docking, digital payments, consumer and merchant financing, digital wallets, and more. Think of it as the Amazon, Shopify, and PayPal of Latin America all rolled into one.', ""Many investors have avoided the stock because of the risks inherent in the region, which is understandable. For example, Argentina -- MercadoLibre's birthplace and one of its biggest markets -- has an inflation rate that clocks in at 143%, and the country just devalued its currency by 50%. Other countries in the region grapple with hyperinflation, economic turmoil, charges of political corruption, poor infrastructure, and more."", 'Yet those risks pale in the context of the opportunity. Latin America is years behind the U.S. in terms of e-commerce and digital payment penetration, yet adoption continues to grow. Furthermore, Latin America has twice the population of the U.S. and is the fastest-growing e-commerce market in the world, according to Americas Market Intelligence. Finally, because MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction, it has sidestepped many of those risks. As a result, its revenue grew 50% in 2022 while net income soared 480%, a trend that has been ongoing for more than a decade.', 'Understanding the risk, viewed through the lens of the significant long-term opportunity, can provide important insight, which gave me the confidence to buy the stock. My rather modest initial investment in MercadoLibre in 2009 has grown by more than 7,300%, and the company now represents 10% of my portfolio. Not bad for a ""risky"" stock.', 'Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought when I started investing in late 2007. After incurring a late fee at Blockbuster (remember them?) that was more than the cost of buying the movie new, I cut up my membership card and subscribed to Netflix. As an extremely satisfied customer, it made perfect sense to buy the stock once I started investing.', 'Back then, the company was a DVD-by-mail service that had recently begun experimenting with streaming video. Netflix had achieved remarkable penetration in its earliest markets, and I surmised the company could expand its success across the country, which was the basis of my investing thesis.', ""The company has achieved all that and more, becoming the world's largest subscription streaming video service. The value of the initial shares I bought in 2007 has surged more than 19,000%, making Netflix my largest holding at nearly 11% of my portfolio."", 'However, those life-changing gains were only possible because I held the stock for the duration, which is easier said than done. Remember the ""Qwikster"" fiasco of 2011? All the ""Netflix killers"" over the years? How about the loss of 1.2 million subscribers early last year?', 'There were plenty of excuses to sell Netflix over the years, but for me, the investing thesis never changed, so I held on.

Two women who rose the ranks together are poised to eventually replace JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a new Wall Street Journal investigation sheds light on Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of young girls, and Netflix's new chief product officer is part of a rare female CPO-CTO team. Enjoy your Tuesday!"", '- What to watch. Netflix is entering a new era. The company is 26 years old, going back to its DVD-by-mail days, and its streaming operation is in its 16th year. The Hollywood strikes are settled. Last week, Netflix published significant viewership data for the first time—a long-awaited move by actors and creators.', ""One executive shaping the entertainment giant's next chapter is Eunice Kim, Netflix's new chief product officer. Kim joined Netflix from YouTube almost three years ago and was promoted to the C-suite job from her prior role as VP of product in October."", ""Now, she works alongside Netflix chief technology officer Elizabeth Stone in a rare female CPO-CTO team. As chief product officer, Kim is responsible for consumers' TV app experience, mobile experience, search and recommendations, and commercial strategy, including pricing structure, ad-supported tiers, and the recent password sharing crackdown."", 'As Netflix strategizes for the coming decade and beyond, Kim is responsible for evolving the user experience. Netflix has started to introduce gaming and live broadcasts (including the much-delayed Love Is Blind reunion, a ""humbling moment,"" Kim says). A major focus is a more strategic approach to the ""second screen,"" or the phone that viewers often hold in their hand while watching TV. The Netflix mobile app has traditionally been a way to watch Netflix on mobile, no different than the TV app. But Kim sees the mobile app moving forward as a ""Swiss army knife"" to grab users\' attention in different ways.', ""After watching a show with a plot-twist ending, viewers could receive a mobile push notification that directs them to an explanation of the series' finale. Fashion-inclined subscribers could use Netflix mobile to browse onscreen styles. Netflix could incorporate ads on mobile, rather than on the TV screen, to avoid interrupting viewers as much. Subscribers watching a competition show could vote with their mobile devices. Enhancing the mobile experience also allows for more personalization, compared to TVs, which tend to be communal devices, Kim says."", 'Onscreen, Kim wants the browsing experience to feel like ""unwrapping a gift"" when viewers find a new show. She collaborates with Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria when developing internal ""content intelligence"" for shows that predicts the ""travelability"" of content. ""How far does South Korean content travel into the Philippines or to Latin America?"" Kim explains. Those predications help the streamer make decisions about how many languages to translate a show into, for example. Netflix\'s predictive technology can also determine a maturity rating for a series or pinpoint specific points in a show where viewers lose interest.', 'Kim arrived at Google (and then YouTube) in 2009 through the company\'s acquisition of Like.com, an image-based search engine for shopping. Before that, she was a brand manager at PepsiCo. She was living in Chicago at the time and figured brand management in CPG was analogous to product management in tech, which was the job she actually wanted. At PepsiCo, she named new orange juice flavors for Tropicana. (She came up with ""autumn red medley."")', 'Leading Netflix\'s product team is certainly more in line with what Kim set out to do. ""Every role I\'ve had at Netflix has been, quite frankly, the best job I\'ve had in my career in the intellectual challenge of it,"" she says.', 'Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffe', ""The Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Phillips 66's  ROE in this article."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Phillips 66 is:', '25% = US$8.0b ÷ US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.25 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""Firstly, we acknowledge that Phillips 66 has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 23%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. As a result, Phillips 66's remarkable 23% net income growth seen over the past 5 years is likely aided by its high ROE."", ""As a next step, we compared Phillips 66's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 33% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is PSX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""Phillips 66's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 16%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 84% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number."", ""Additionally, Phillips 66 has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 33% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 17% over the same period."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Phillips 66's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

While the below entities might be lagging their underlying indices, they’re poised to outperform in 2024.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'What it is: A stalwart in the mining industry, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is the world’s largest gold mining corporation, according to its public profile. Also, its website states that NEM represents the only gold producer listed in the S&P 500 index. However, NEM is also badly lagging the benchmark, losing about 22% of equity value since the January opener.', 'Relevance: In contrast, the S&P 500 is up about 21% on a year-to-date basis. Therefore, NEM would have to quickly reverse course regarding its momentum. But that’s exactly what analysts have in mind. Currently, they rate shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $48.67 average price target. That implies about 25% upside potential. Further, the high-side target stands at $58, implying about 49% up.', 'Pros: True to the subject matter, NEM represents one of the undervalued stocks (albeit barely). Shares trade at forward earnings multiple of 10.61x, just below the sector median of 10.92x. Further, if the fear trade kicks in, NEM could soar to surprising heights.', 'Cons: Fundamentally, the gold-mining space has been volatile. Also, if the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates, NEM could suffer.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock', 'What it is: An independent petroleum company, Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV) cynically benefited from rising hydrocarbon demand. However, various geopolitical and economic forces have seen a disinflationary effect against the underlying sector. As a result, OVV gave up more than 11% of equity value since the beginning of the year.', 'Relevance: Although the underlying small-cap field tends to shoot higher during upcycles and post worrying red ink during downcycles, the Russell 2000 has only gained about 8% since the start of the year. Still, it’s obvious that OVV lags the index. Nevertheless, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $57.06 price target. That implies upside potential of around 37%.', 'Pros: What makes OVV so enticing is that it offers a legitimate case for undervalued stocks. Specifically, shares trade at forward earnings multiple of 4.44x, below the sector median of 7.59x. Further, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 23.3%, above the sector’s average of 10.7%.', 'Cons: Aside from the choppy nature of hydrocarbons, OVV is particularly exposed to geopolitical risks. As well, investors should closely monitor the Fed’s monetary policy.', 'What it is: A multinational tech firm, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) represents one of China’s powerhouse business enterprises. Specializing in internet-related services and products, Baidu has been aggressively pushing into the field of artificial intelligence. Given the sector’s growth ramp, BIDU makes for compelling speculation. However, it’s down about 5% YTD.', 'Relevance: Without question, BIDU lags the Nasdaq-100 – and glaringly so. Since the beginning of the year, the tech-centric index jumped more than 49%. That’s not an easy feat to duplicate, let alone beat. Nevertheless, that’s exactly what market experts are calling for with their strong buy consensus view. More to the point, analysts see shares hitting $170.41, implying 50% upside potential. Also, the high-side target lands at $215, projecting over 89% growth.', 'Pros: If you can handle the risk, BIDU represents one of the deeply undervalued stocks to consider. Right now, shares trade hands at a forward earnings multiple of 10.46x. In contrast, the sector median comes in at a loftier 16.48x.', 'Cons: While BIDU intrigues because of its relative discount, worries exist about China’s economic slowdown.

Over the years, it has adapted to globalization, technological advancements, and changes in consumer preferences. The integration of automation and digitalization has revolutionized production processes, enhancing efficiency but also impacting employment patterns. Industrial stocks, typically recognized for their stability and resilience, have traditionally outperformed the broader market during periods of economic expansion and recovery. However, the current year has witnessed a departure from this trend. In 2023, the S&P 500 Industrial Index has seen a gain of 10.53%, lagging behind the broader S&P 500, which posted a 20.7% gain.', 'However, underestimating the sector\'s potential for 2024 and beyond could be a mistake for investors. The challenges in the supply chain during the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions have underscored the benefits of increased US self-sufficiency after decades of underinvestment in the country\'s industrial base. Consequently, there is a significant influx of federal funding and other incentives, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars, poised to support infrastructure development, onshoring/reshoring initiatives, climate change mitigation, and the ""electrification of everything.""', ""According to McKinsey, leading players in the industrials sector have created value by prioritizing product margin optimization and actively participating in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) over the past two decades. The effectiveness of these strategies is evident in the period from 2014 to 2019, where the return on capital employed (ROCE) for the sector increased by 13%, surpassing the typical sector-level weighted average cost of capital, typically ranging from 8% to 10%.

Higher rates have made it more expensive for companies to borrow money. In addition, rising rates weighed on the valuations of dividend stocks to drive up their yields and compensate investors for their higher risk profiles compared to alternatives like bonds. ', ""Shares of NextEra have plunged more than 27%, while units of the partnership have cratered by nearly 60%. Those declines have driven up their dividend yields. (NextEra yields more than 3%, while the partnership's payout is over 11.5%.)\xa0"", 'However, interest rates could go from a headwind to a tailwind next year if the Federal Reserve cuts them, as many anticipate. That could lift the weight on their shares, causing them to soar in 2024. ', 'This past year has been a challenging one for NextEra Energy and its partnership. The utility had used that entity as a funding vehicle. It would sell operating renewable energy assets to the partnership, giving it cash to recycle into its massive backlog of development projects. Meanwhile, those deals provided NextEra Energy Partners with the recurring cash flow to grow its dividend.', ""However, surging interest rates and the declining value of the partnership's unit price drove up its cost of capital, making it difficult to finance acquisitions. They also made it more expensive for the company to roll over maturing debt. For example, NextEra Energy Partners recently priced $750 million of 7.25% notes due in 2029 to refinance notes that mature next year. The interest rate on those maturing notes is 4.25%. That's a meaningful interest expense increase. "", ""NextEra Energy Partners' surging capital costs forced it to slam the brakes on its growth plan. The company cut its dividend growth outlook from 12%-15% annually through 2026 to 5%-8%, with a target of 6%. The company also shifted its growth strategy from acquiring assets from NextEra Energy in drop-down transactions to internally funding organic expansion projects, like repowering existing wind farms. "", ""The issues facing its affiliate also forced NextEra Energy to shift gears. It has pivoted its capital recycling strategy to external sales. In September, the company agreed to sell Florida City Gas to Chesapeake Utilities for $923 million in cash. It will likely need to look externally to recycle more capital next year, since NextEra Energy Partners doesn't expect to need to make an acquisition to achieve 6% dividend growth in 2024. "", ""While rising interest rates impacted NextEra's strategy over the past year, that headwind should start to fade in 2024. The Federal Reserve has paused increasing the federal funds rate after hiking it 11 times over the past two years to its current target range of 5.25%-5.5%, the highest level in over two decades. "", ""While the Fed had hinted in the past that it could push rates even higher, it changed its tune at the last meeting, instead indicating that it will likely cut rates three times next year, by 0.25% each time. Further, the Fed's most recent forecast suggests it would cut rates four more times in 2025 and three more times in 2026, eventually getting rates down closer to 2%. "", 'Falling interest rates will be a major catalyst for NextEra Energy and its partnership. It will reduce the interest rate on their floating rate debt while making it less costly for them to roll over maturing debt. In addition, falling rates will push up the values of income-producing investments as yields adjust to the current rate environment. ', ""We've already seen that in the stock prices of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, which have rallied off their bottoms. NextEra is up 6% in the past month, while the partnership has surged almost 28%. "", 'Those rate-powered rallies could continue in 2024. In addition, their stocks should get a lift as investors grow more confident that the companies can achieve their long-term growth plans. ', 'NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners tumbled this year as rising rates weighed on their values. However, that headwind should fade next year as rates appear poised to start falling.

For Financials, the new banking regulations are seen as limiting buybacks, as purchases may be used for option coverage, with minimal discretionary purchases, which reduce share count and increase EPS. Top-tier cash-flow issues however are seen as continuing their buybacks and positively impacting their EPS.

Given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support and has remained an attractive cash generator for the government, there is an expectation that some increase or potential change to the type of buybacks that are taxed will remain on the table into next year. Given that corporate sensitivity to costs has increased, a buyback tax rate of 2%, down from a 2.5% rate when companies were less sensitive, was seen as impacting both buybacks and the EPS of share-count-reduction as some of the expenditures may shift from buybacks to dividends. However, any shift would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets.""', 'Q3 2023 GICS® Sector Analysis:', ""Information Technology maintained its lead in buybacks.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the financial technology industry, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Promising Fintech Stocks To Buy.', ""The finance industry is one of the largest in the world. Banks have been working for centuries to manage money and make payments for businesses, and throughout its history, the industry has had to keep up with the times. To understand just how old the finance system is, consider the world's largest private bank in terms of assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JPMorgan traces its history back to the days of the American Revolution, as it was acquired by Chase Manhattan bank in 2000 to become the biggest bank holding company in the U.S. Chase Manhattan itself was initially set up in 1799, making it one of the oldest banks in the world. However, JPMorgan isn't the oldest bank in the world, with one of the oldest financial institutions being Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.\xa0 - a state owned Italian bank that was set up in 1624 and traced its roots back to 1472."", ""The world, if you're unaware, has significantly changed since 1472. Now, banks and financial institutions process thousands of transactions daily and move money thousands of miles across the world. Similarly, companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) have leveraged technology to serve a larger number of people who are covered by the financial system. Banking, like gasoline, is a commodity and the lack of access to a bank account often means that people cannot perform or earn to their full potential. After all, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is unlikely to pay its employees hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in cash, and anyone who cannot open a bank account often misses out on financial opportunities."", ""The intersection of the finance industry and modern day computing technology is dubbed 'fintech'. Short form for financial technology, the fintech sector is simply defined as the use of technology to steal market share away from traditional financial providers when it comes to managing finances for businesses or enabling consumers to spend, save, or earn their money. Naturally, this potential of being able to cater to millions of consumers and businesses means that the right financial technology companies can be quite valuable."", ""As an illustration, consider the consulting firm McKinsey's estimate of the total market value of publicly traded fintech companies as of July 2023. According to the firm, these companies were worth $550 billion, a two fold increase over the four years since 2019. While this figure is quite sizeable on its own, it doesn't represent the full value of the fintech sector since McKinsey adds that fintech unicorns were worth an additional $936 billion for an unbelievable growth from the $1 billion in value just five years back."", 'Yet, just like the broader stock market, the fintech sector is also subject to the whims of the global economy. Venture Capital funding in fintech companies stood at $19.4 billion in 2015 to sit at $33.3 billion in 2020. Just like the coronavirus pandemic saw money flow into technology companies on the back of stronger demand for their products, money also piled into the fintech sector as $92.3 billion was poured into these companies in 2021 as users turned to the digital realm for their financial needs in the wake of lock downs and economic disruption.', 'Similarly, just as other industries are now desperately seeking the integration of artificial intelligence, so is the financial technology industry. So much so that one of the biggest payment platforms and service providers in the world, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently published a report highlighting the ten ways in which GenAI can disrupt the banking and financial sectors. According to Mastercard, these use cases include preventing fraud, bringing new clients on board, issuing credit, managing loyalty programs, enabling the wealthy to manage their money, and offloading some customer support to chat bots.', 'With GenAI being all the hype and technology continuing to break boundaries, we decided to look at the most promising fintech stocks according to hedge funds.

High yields can signal a dividend cut, depending on how various other metrics shape up. Even more concerning is the company's payout ratio at the moment. It currently exceeds 200%, which is unsustainable for most companies."", ' However, because of the nature of the business model Enbridge operates under, a better metric for determining the sustainability of the payout is to look at its payout ratio in comparison to its discounted cash flow (DCF), which excludes non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization.

If you want to skip our overview of what a metaverse is and the latest news, then take a look at the 5 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks To Buy. ', 'The metaverse is a new technological sector that aims to transport humans into the digital realm. Ever since the personal computer became popular in the 1990s, and 3D graphics cards started to make their way into the market during the same time period, humans have used a virtual experience for their entertainment in the form of video games. In fact, the global video game market is worth a whopping $224 billion as of 2022 end, and it is estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5% to be worth $610 billion by 2032. Safe to say, digital experiences are here to stay, and as technology advances, they are also evolving with time.', 'While traditional video games limit a player to looking at a screen or using a headset, the metaverse seeks to transport them into the digital realm. While there are several different definitions for a metaverse, the simplest is that it is a 3D environment that allows people to have lifelike, yet digital, experiences. The metaverse caught the public attention during the coronavirus pandemic, as people were forced indoors and had to work and play from home.', ""This growth in consumer interest did not go unnoticed by the finance industry and investors. Data from Crunchbase shows that in 2021, metaverse companies doubled their capital raises to $10 billion. This figure further blossomed in 2022 when $120 billion flew into the sector during the first eight months of the year according to data from the consulting firm McKinsey. And despite the general pessimism in the industry surrounding the technology, McKinsey is also quite optimistic about the metaverse's future as it expects that the sector can generate as much as $5 trillion in value by 2030."", ""Building on the flow of investments in 2022, 2023 has been a busy year for the metaverse. There are few companies right now with the software and computing power to operate such a platform, and one of these is the San Mateo, California based video game developer Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX). Roblox made a splash in November 2023 when it announced its Roblox Connect platform. Through Roblox Connect, Roblox players will be able to call and communicate with their friends in the digital realm. This is a unique service, and the announcement also appears to have a positive impact on the firm's shares that have struggled in 2023. Between January and the end of the first week of November, Roblox's shares lost 16%, but since it announced Roblox Connect, the stock is up by a healthy 17% to mark 6% in year to date gains."", ""Any mention of the metaverse is incomplete without talking about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the only big tech mega cap company that is extremely bullish on the metaverse. Meta's CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has piled in $36 billion into the metaverse, but so far, the money has yielded little results. Nevertheless, its scale does allow it to break in new markets, and Meta's launch of the Quest 3 virtual reality headset in October did stimulate the declining VR market to an extent. However, data from CNBC shows that as of late November, VR headset sales in America dropped to $664 million for a 40% drop. Seems like the metaverse will take some time to catch up with users."", ""Commenting on the Quest and the metaverse, here's what the Meta chief had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:"", 'Now finally, in addition to AI, our other major long-term focus is the metaverse. And we just launched Quest 3, our most powerful headset yet, at a very competitive price.', 'We packed a lot of improvements in there, including a next generation chipset with 2x the graphics performance, our best display as yet, and a form factor that’s 40% thinner than Quest 2. But the most important breakthrough for Quest 3 is that it’s the first mainstream mixed reality device. And that means that when you put on the device, you see your physical room around you, and you can bring digital objects and games into your physical space, whether that’s a ping pong table, your workstation, a big screen TV to play Xbox games on, or your friends as holograms. The early reviews have been great, and it’s been fun to see how people respond to this. We also launched the next generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. They’re upgraded from the first generation in basically every way.', 'Better camera, clearer audio, they’re lighter, they have more styles, and you can now even live stream video from them. But most importantly, these are the first smart glasses shipping with Meta AI built in. So you can ask your glasses questions throughout the day. It’ll answer them right in your ear. And in many ways, glasses are the ideal form factor for an AI device because they enable your AI assistant to see what you see and hear what you hear. Again, it’s good to see the early reviews, they’re so positive, and I’m looking forward to this space evolving quickly over the coming years. We are also making progress on software for the metaverse too. Horizon is now growing faster. There’s more new worlds like Super Rumble and Citadel come online.', ""Today we'll look at some promising metaverse stocks according to hedge funds with the notable picks being Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)."", 'A patient wearing a virtual reality headset, experiencing the immersive world of virtualized healthcare.', 'Our Methodology ', 'As part of the process of compiling the most promising metaverse stocks according to hedge funds, we ranked the top 30 holdings of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares during Q3 2023 and picked the top stocks.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2023: 57 ', 'ASML Holding N.V.

Per latest figures, the shares of these three firms are all up this year, by 25%, 55%, and 245% respectively. There is little doubt that these tech firms still have a formidable runway for growth. Visa Inc.

Roth IRA are accounts that offer people the benefits of tax-free growth and withdrawals after retirement.

Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.', 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Analysts. ', ""The primary reason most folks are attracted to the stock market is growth. If bets are timed right, then investment can double or even triple in value over a short period of time depending on the market conditions. This phenomenon is so integral to the stock market that we don't even have to look too far back in its history to see its illustration. This is because 2023 has been the year of artificial intelligence when it comes to stocks. San Francisco, California based OpenAI took the world by storm this year when it first introduced ChatGPT - the world's first chat bot based on generative AI - and then followed up GPT-4, one of the most advanced A.I. models on the planet."", ""This created a feverish stock buying frenzy that saw investors flock to A.I. companies to profit from their shares. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the rush to A.I. was the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA designs graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are essential to training and operating advanced A.I. models. So how does NVIDIA tie into our narrative of the stock market being one of the biggest deliverers of investment growth? Well, NVIDIA's potential to dominate the global A.I. conversation has led its shares to gain a whopping 249% year to date. What this means is that if you have invested $1,000 into its shares at the start of this year, then your investment would be worth $3,490 right now, leaving you with more than three times what you had in January."", ""While NVIDIA is one of the biggest growth stories of this year, as a whole, investors have some tools up their sleeves when it comes to classifying growth stocks. One of these is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. A P/E ratio evaluates the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's shares over its earnings. Generally, the higher the P/E ratio is w.r.t the industry multiple, the stronger the 'growth sentiment' about a company is. This is because investors are 'pricing in' future earnings growth through the share price by paying a higher price now with the hope that earnings will increase in the future."", ""However, growth is not an absolute principle for the stock market. The market's ability to deliver principal growth is quite dependent on the broader economic environment. Once again, since 2022 and 2023 have been some of the most historic years for the market, we don't have to look too far back to see how this works. 2022 was marked by record high inflation fueled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the low interest rates during the pandemic era. To bring inflation down, the Federal Reserve aggressively jacked up interest rates, which isn't great for either the market or growth stocks. Higher interest rates mean that money flows into high rate securities since they are essentially risk free. This made the stock market lose, and for growth stocks, this was compounded by inflation. Inflation isn't great for growth stocks, and not only for their market performance. Higher inflation means firms can not comfortably invest in the future, the demand for their products drops, and they have to tighten their belts to maintain stability."", 'Yet, with 2023 coming to an end, the tides of the stock market appear to be shifting. This is because there is a growing consensus among investors that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking rates, making them adjust their investments accordingly. This made us think about making a list of the top growth stocks that analysts believe are promising. Within this list, some top picks are Alphabet Inc.

However, it remains to be seen how the guidance and the FTC and DOJ’s more novel theories of harm will play out in the courts.', 'The guidance could also be seen as a boon to market behemoths like UnitedHealth and CVS that have been allowed to swell to a massive size,\xa0by preventing their rivals from growing to a similar scale through a series of M&A, Ray said.', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

Ines, what can you tell us?"", ""INES FERRE: Yeah, so billionaire, Carl Icahn, isn't giving in up-- giving up on putting more of his nominees on that board. So Icahn has been a big critic of the $7 billion acquisition of Grail, the cancer detection test maker. Now the deal has brought nothing but regulatory problems for Illumina. Let's back up for a second, and put this all into context for you."", 'Illumina took over Grail in August 2021, and it did so without securing regulatory approval from the European Union. So subsequently EU regulators blocked that deal on concerns that it was-- that it would stifle innovation. And the EU slapped a fine on Illumina, and then it ordered the company to unwind the Grail deal. Amid all this, you had Icahn-- Carl Icahn that sent a letter to the board saying that his nominees need to be on that board, and that they have experience with dealing with crisis.', 'Icahn said he wanted to strike a deal and avoid a proxy battle in October, but shareholders voted in-- in Andrew Teno. He\'s a portfolio manager working for Icahn. So he has a win there, and he ousted the chairman. Illumina announced it is divesting Grail, and Icahn reportedly wants more of his people on the board now for the process. And going forward in a letter that was made public in a filing, Icahn wrote, ""It would be a great mistake to allow the legacy conflicted directors to influence Illumina given their history of reckless decision-making and value destruction.', ""So basically what he's saying is here. Look, he's been a very big critic of this deal. The deal went south because of the EU regulators. And he is criticizing the board, and he's criticizing the company for having made this deal in the first place and saying that the stock-- if you take a look at the stock, let's pull up the chart if we can for Illumina, the stock is down about 75% since that deal went through in 2021. And it's wiped out about $55 billion in value for shareholders. So he's very angry about that and that's why he wants his people on that board."", ""BRAD SMITH: All right.

A single cow can produce up to 500 liters of methane a day, or 160 kilograms per year, mostly through eructation (that is, belching). Multiply that by the planet's 1.4 billion cattle, and it might be a burp, not a butterfly wing, that causes a hurricane on the other side of the world."", ""Dairy foods continue to have an important role in feeding the world. It's not the cattle's fault that, by mass, there's more of them than any other mammal on earth (including us). Their digestive systems do what they can with the food we allot them. Given all this, what can researchers do to mitigate bovine belching? They can focus on cattle digestive systems. A cow's methane emissions are influenced by its gut microbiome, and evidence shows that their microbiome composition is influenced in turn by their genotype. Breeding cattle who simply emit less methane than their peers might be ideal-but this research is in its early stages."", ""How about focusing on cattle feed? Some studies have found that adding the methane inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) to a cow's diet reduces their methane output by up to 30%, with no apparent negative impact on their health or milk production. But these studies are also relatively recent, and 3-NOP warrants further research before it can be made commercially available at scale."", '""That will help, and potentially be a much faster improvement,"" says Matthew Shaffer. ""Genetics is a long-term game. It takes time for genetics to work through the system. But the benefits of genetics are permanent and cumulative.""', ""Shaffer is the CEO of DataGene, an initiative of Dairy Australia that's driving genetic gain and herd improvement in the country's dairy industry. DataGene publishes three indices that track desirable genetic traits among Australia's 1.4 million cattle: A Balanced Performance Index, for traits that affect their lifetime contribution to the farm business; a Health Weighted Index, which fast tracks genetic gain for fertility, feed efficiency, and disease resistance; and a Sustainability Index, which fast tracks genetic gain for reduced methane emissions intensity."", 'Thinking in these terms-not gross emissions, but emissions intensity-is another way to tackle the methane problem. Say you have two cows of the same weight, diet, and gross emissions, but every day one produces 20 liters of milk and the other 30 liters. The higher-producing cow dilutes their methane output across more production throughout their lifetime. ""If you need to supply 100 liters of milk, you get it with less methane,"" Shaffer explains. ""But with increased production comes other consequences, on fertility and other traits."" For example, a longer-lived cow also has a reduced emissions intensity, because the first two years before she can begin producing milk constitutes a smaller percentage of her life. ""That\'s why emissions intensity is balanced within our index: so we don\'t cause other issues by chasing only production.""', ""Genomic sequencing has enabled dairy farmers to make breeding decisions much faster, with greater accuracy, based on genomic breeding values. No longer do they have to wait to see how productive, fertile, or hardy a bull's progeny are before they decide whether to use that bull for further breeding: These genomic breeding values can be calculated for animals as soon as they're born. This reduces the time between generations and, according to one estimate, saves bull breeding companies up to 92% of their costs."", ""Australian dairy farmers looking to order top-quality bull semen can use DataGene's apps to rank animals based on these indices, to fit their particular needs. They can also sequence their female animals simply by taking a small tissue sample, usually from an ear. They send the sample to a genomic service provider, who genotypes it and returns a genomic breeding value for that cow. Equipped with these values, farmers can make more informed decisions about which animals to keep in their herd."", '""We couldn\'t do what we do without DairyBio, who provide a lot of the research and work closely with Illumina to add SNPs to their systems,"" Shaffer says, referring to the genetic markers that this genotyping looks for.', 'DataGene\'s next big project is aggregating vast amounts of new sequencing data into their Central Data Repository (CDR). ""We\'re connecting the CDR to various equipment manufacturers to bring new data we\'ve never seen before,"" Shaffer says. ""Some of it will be milking machine information from robots; some will be information from companies we don\'t currently have access to. It\'s really important to expand the CDR, which will enable us to produce better tools and analytics for farmers.""', 'It\'s not always the case that a company CEO starts out on the ""shop room floor"" in the same industry.

That\'s because of the popular investing strategy called ""the Dogs of the Dow,"" which focuses on buying the 10 Dow Jones Industrial Average components that have the highest yields. Because share prices and dividend yields generally move in opposite directions (absent a large change to a company\'s payout), the blue-chip stocks with the highest yields will likely have performed poorly in the past calendar year and could be trading at attractive valuations.', 'But we don\'t have to wait until the official end of 2023 to search for values in the Dow, whether they count as ""dogs"" or not. We can already see some good reasons to buy Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Nike (NYSE: NKE) for 2024 and beyond. Let\'s find out a bit more about these three beaten-down Dow stocks.', ""Procter & Gamble's 5% year-to-date stock price decline through mid-December was weak enough to make it the seventh-worst-performing stock on the Dow in 2023. That's as compared to the index's 12% rally over the same time."", ""That sell-off was not enough to earn P&G a spot on the Dogs of the Dow list -- its yield is just 2.6%. However, it still seems overdone given the consumer staples giant's strong operating and financial momentum. Organic sales were up 7% in its fiscal 2024 Q1 (which ended Sept. 30), putting P&G on track to hit the high end of management's fiscal year growth outlook. Revenue should rise by about 5% this fiscal year after expanding by 7% in fiscal 2023."", ""On the downside, P&G is struggling to boost organic sales volumes, and so it has had to rely entirely on rising prices to boost overall revenue. Yet a return to growth on this metric, along with the stock's 2.6% dividend yield, would power solid returns from here for patient investors."", ""Coke's stock slump in 2023 just doesn't make sense. The beverage titan is winning market share, boosting sales, and generating sparkling profits. Yet the stock has dropped 7% through mid-December, making it the fifth-worst performer on the index."", ""Investors shouldn't waste time trying to find a good reason for Coke's share price decline, but instead should consider capitalizing on it. You can own this Dividend King for less than 6 times annual sales, down from a 2023 high valuation of closer to 7 times sales. Coke has only been valued this cheaply a handful of times over the past decade."", ""The stock's yield at its current share price is over 3% today, putting Coke in the top 10 on the Dow by that metric. There are plenty of resources behind that dividend payment. Coke's profit margin is a blazing 30% of sales or roughly double Pepsico's rate."", ""Nike's position in the footwear industry has made it an unpopular choice among investors in 2023. Shares have gained just 4% this year, which makes it the 12th worst performer on the index. That weak outing makes sense because its retail niche has been shrinking and is becoming more price-competitive. Retailers like Foot Locker have seen their profit margins dive due to aggressive price cuts by rivals."", ""Yet Nike's exposure to this problem is limited. It has done a great job slashing inventory in recent quarters, easing pricing pressure on the business. And Nike's focus on innovation provides another lift. Pre-tax earnings last quarter slipped only slightly, falling to 13% from 15% in the prior-year period."", 'Investors can find faster-growing, more profitable stocks in this niche. Lululemon Athletica is a prime example. But with Nike, you get a lower valuation, plus a modest dividend that yields 1.2% and that is likely to rise for many years to come.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nike wasn't one of them.

Strength in the North America, EMEA and APLA regions, fueled by increasing traffic, higher conversion and growth in average order value, is likely to have aided sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The NIKE Direct business has been benefiting from robust growth across regions and an efficient digital ecosystem, which comprises its online site, and commercial and activity apps. Revenues at NIKE-owned stores are expected to have gained from improved traffic, higher conversion rates and growth in average order value.

Also, elevated SG&A expenses are concerning.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company predicted a 100-bps improvement in the gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by gains in strategic pricing, improved markdowns and lower ocean freight rates. This is expected to have been partly offset by higher product input costs and 50 bps of negative impacts of adverse currency rates.NIKE has been witnessing elevated SG&A expenses, driven by increased demand-creation expenses due to the normalization of sporting activities and overhead costs related to higher wages. Demand-creation expenses are likely to have increased in the fiscal second quarter, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments. These investments are likely to have supported significant global sports moments and product launches, and investment in capabilities to transform NIKE's operating model for greater speed and effectiveness.Operating overhead expenses are expected to have resulted from higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected second-quarter fiscal 2024 SG&A expenses to increase in the mid to high-single digits, owing to increased demand creation investments.We anticipate the gross margin to expand 100 bps to 43.9%. Meanwhile, our estimate for SG&A expenses of $4,362.5 million indicates a year-over-year rise of 5.8%. We expect demand-creation expenses to increase 8% year over year and operating overheads to rise 5% year over year in the fiscal second quarter.Driven by the soft gross margin and higher SG&A expenses, our model suggests a 50-bps contraction in the operating margin to 11.4% in the fiscal second quarter."", 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NIKE this time around.

Just last week, Pfizer issued downbeat guidance for the year ahead. But today, analysts at Citigroup put out a note suggesting that Pfizer is lowballing the market and setting itself up to beat earnings in 2024.', 'Pfizer stock is up 3.1% through 10:50 a.m. ET in response.', ""On Wednesday last week, Pfizer guided investors on what to expect from it in 2024. With demand for COVID-19-related vaccines and treatment continuing to dwindle, Pfizer predicted sales of Comirnaty (the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine) and Paxlovid (the Pfizer treatment for coronavirus) will total only about $8 billion next year. The company's acquisition of Seagen will add about $3.1 billion worth of oncology sales. But even so, total sales for the year will range from only $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion -- so $60 billion at the midpoint, which works out to about 4% year-over-year growth."", ""Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings will range from $2.05 to $2.25 per share. And this is even after cutting $4 billion in annual costs. (Pfizer explained that the cost of acquiring Seagen will subtract about $0.40 per share from the year's profit.)"", 'As reported on The Fly today, Citi is putting Pfizer stock on a ""90-day catalyst watch,"" anticipating that sometime in the next three months (i.e., by the time Pfizer comes out with new guidance in its first-quarter earnings report), the pharmaceuticals giant will report news sufficient to raise its guidance -- and its stock price, too.', ""Citi, you see, thinks Pfizer will earn at least 11% more than the top of the company's published guidance range -- so at least $2.50 per share. Curiously though, that still isn't enough to convince the banker that Pfizer stock is a buy. The analyst only rates Pfizer stock as neutral."", ""Is that the right call, though? I mean, if Pfizer earns $2.50 per share, and its shares cost less than $28 today, then that works out to a P/E ratio of only 11.2 on the stock. Pfizer's excellent dividend yield of 6.2% is enough to cover half that valuation all on its own. Seems to me, if Pfizer is growing even just 4% or 5% per year -- which it is promising to do next year -- then that more than justifies the valuation on this premier pharmaceuticals play."", 'Call me an optimist if you will, but after seeing its stock drop by nearly half over the past year, I kind of think Pfizer stock looks like a buy right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

This marked the first approval for a combination of an ADC product plus PD-L1 inhibitor for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, offering an alternative to platinum-containing chemotherapy, the current standard of care in first-line la/mUC, for years.', 'Antibody-drug conjugates are considered a disruptive innovation in the pharmaceutical industry as these are expected to enable better treatment of cancer by harnessing the targeting power of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic molecule drugs to tumors. These are poised to replace chemotherapy in many tumor types.', 'The approval was based on data from the phase III EV-302 (also known as KEYNOTE-A39) study. Data from the study showed that Padcev plus Keytruda\xa0nearly doubled the median overall survival (OS) and median progression-free survival (PFS)\xa0in the abovementioned advanced bladder cancer patient group compared to platinum-containing chemotherapy. Treatment with the combination led to a 53% reduction in the risk of death (OS) and a 55% reduction in the risk of cancer progression or death (PFS). Pfizer believes the survival benefit seen in the study shows the potential of Padcev plus Keytruda for the\xa0first-line treatment of patients with la/mUC.', 'At present, Padcev, in combination with Keytruda, is approved, on an accelerated basis, for treating la/mUC in adult patients who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.

With the latest approval, Padcev in combination with Keytruda is eligible for expanded use in patients with la/mUC who are eligible to receive cisplatin chemotherapy.', 'Pfizer’s stock has declined 47.3% so far this year against an increase of 3.9% for the industry.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Pfizer’s acquisition of Seagen closed on Dec 14.

NPS scores measure how likely a customer is to recommend a product to a friend, rated on a scale of -100 to 100. Typically, a score in the 80s is reserved for life-changing purchases or products that bring joy into a customer's life. Growing from just 3 million users at the end of 2020 to 32 million in the last quarter, BNPL will remain an exciting growth story for PayPal. The cherry on top for investors?

While the company already has similar deals with Home Depot and Tractor Supply, these added sales could help Toro's residential segment rebound once they reach the cycle trough."", ""Furthermore, with Toro's focus on making tuck-in acquisitions over time -- including five in the past five years -- this temporary industry downturn could prove to be an opportunity for the company to strike again. While investors wait, Toro will likely reward its shareholders with its 20th consecutive year of dividend increases, thanks partly to a payout ratio of only 37%."", ""With time, customers will reach the replacement cycle on their lockdown-spurred purchases, leading to brighter days for Toro's residential business -- not to mention the steady results from its larger professional operations.

If you're putting $20 to work in the market right now, I think three stocks to buy and hold forever are Spotify (NYSE: SPOT), NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP), and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), because they have what it takes to be long-term winners."", ""Spotify has made the economics of streaming work for the music industry, and it's built a market-leading position in the process. But the company hasn't been a big winner for investors yet, which I think will change in 2024."", ""After years of building a streaming giant, Spotify is finally reaching scale and proving it's the go-to place for music, podcast, and audiobook creators alike. The company's monthly active user base jumped 26% in the third quarter of 2023 to 574 million and will reach 1 billion users in a few years at this pace. Premium revenue was up 10% to 2.9 billion euros for the quarter, but that's before the impact of price increases that will start to help revenue this quarter."", ""As great as this momentum is, the company's profit potential is in advertising and cost reductions. On the ad side, Spotify has spent years building out advertising infrastructure, and ads grew 16% to 447 million euros last quarter, which I think will accelerate. Costs will help financials even faster, with operating expenses down 13% in the third quarter to 853 million euros, and more reductions are coming after a recent round of layoffs."", 'Over the next decade, I think Spotify will expand its dominance in audio products, improving monetization and profitability, which could lead to market-beating returns.', 'Few companies will benefit more from falling interest rates than NextEra Energy Partners. The company owns renewable energy assets that produce cash flow and ultimately pay dividends to investors, but it uses debt to fund some of those acquisitions.', ""Coming into the year, the company had $2.2 billion of debt that needed to be refinanced before 2026, at higher rates. But the recent drop in rates will give a bit of a reprieve for the company's finances, which were getting stretched throughout the year."", 'Now, NextEra Energy Partners is facing incrementally less financing pressure. The company recently closed a $750 million 7.25% senior unsecured notes offering and cut back expected dividend growth to 5% to 8%. But with the dividend yielding 11.6%, even zero growth would make this an outstanding stock to buy and hold long-term.', 'The payments business has been in turmoil all year, with margins falling and growth starting to slow. But PayPal has a steady business that will provide value for long-term investors.', ""You can see in the chart that PayPal has grown steadily over nearly a decade, and it's generating free cash flow and buying back shares. There are challenges with cash flow falling in 2023, but I think that will be remedied as the industry focuses more on profitably processing transactions and growing subscription revenue."", ""PayPal is riding a long-term wave of digital payments and has tacked on valuable subscription services that businesses run on. The network effects of these businesses are hard to break and will keep PayPal's cash flow strong for years to come."", ""You don't have to invest a lot to start in the market, but getting started is the hardest part.

But its momentum faded as high inflation stunted discretionary spending, so much so that management nixed its medium-term financial targets.', 'Many investors interpreted that as a sell signal. PayPal stock had already started falling in response to economic uncertainty, but the sell-off accelerated when the company revised its outlook. That downward pressure has never really abated as PayPal has seen its share price slip 14% year to date, despite strong gains across the S&P 500, and the stock now trades 80% below its record high.', 'Many Wall Street analysts see that as an opportunity. PayPal has a consensus buy rating, and its median 12-month price target of $69.83 implies 14% upside from the current share price. But Morningstar analyst Brett Horn is especially bullish -- his price target of $135 per share implies 120% upside for PayPal shareholders.', 'With that in mind, the S&P 500 is less than 2% below a new record high (and a new bull market), a milestone that typically signals a period of sizable gains across the stock market. Is now a good time to invest in PayPal?', 'PayPal beat consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines in the third quarter. Revenue rose 8% to $7.4 billion on double-digit increases in transactions and payment volume. Non-GAAP net income jumped 20% to $1.30 per diluted share as the company continued to prioritize cost controls and repurchase stock. But the new CEO Alex Chriss sees room for improvement.', '""I believe our cost base and complex structure is slowing us down,"" he said on the earnings call in November. ""We have opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth while reducing our expenses."" Chriss also enumerated three areas where the company will focus investments: (1) digital wallets for consumers, (2) branded PayPal checkout solutions for small businesses, and (3) unbranded checkout solutions like Braintree for large enterprises.', 'PayPal benefits from a data advantage arising from its two-sided network. Specifically, most processors form relationships with merchants, but PayPal offers financial products to merchants and consumers, meaning it has a deeper understanding of consumer preferences and purchase habits. PayPal applies artificial intelligence (AI) to that information to surface shopper insights, boost approval rates, and prevent fraud for merchants.', 'Chriss explained that advantage on the most recent earnings call:', ""Our machine learning capabilities combine hundreds of risk and fraud models with dozens of real-time analytics engines and petabytes of payments data to generate insights by learning users' behaviors, relationships, interests, and spending habits. This scale gives us a very unique advantage in the market. Our ability to create meaningful profiles with the help of AI is exceptionally promising."", 'The upshot of that unique advantage is that PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet in North America and Europe, and it dominates the online payment processing space with more than 40% market share. For context, PayPal holds nearly twice as much market share as its closest competitor, Stripe.', 'That hints at high-single-digit sales growth (at a minimum) for years to come, simply because PayPal is a critical part of global e-commerce infrastructure, and online retail sales are projected to increase 8% annually through 2030. But that estimate leaves room for upside if PayPal takes share in e-commerce or gains traction in physical retail.', 'On that note, the company recently announced that U.S. consumers can add PayPal and Venmo credit and debit cards to their Apple Wallets and use them anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. That partnership could help PayPal gain share at physical points of sales because Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile payment option among U.S. consumers.', ""Brett Horn of Morningstar expects PayPal to grow revenue at 10% annually over the next decade. That estimate is reasonable given the company's strong presence in online payment processing and its commitment to more effective innovation across key product categories. In that light, its current valuation of 2.4 times sales looks cheap, especially when compared to the three-year average of 6.9 times sales."", 'That creates an attractive buying opportunity for patient investors, especially with the S&P 500 approaching bull market territory. But the key word is patient. There is no guarantee that shareholders will make money over the next year, and the odds of triple-digit returns are remote at best. PayPal stock is best viewed as a long-term investment.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The company has built a platform for each. Red Hat's ubiquitous software takes center stage in the hybrid cloud arena, while the recently launched watsonx platform now leads the charge in AI."", ""IBM has divested plenty of businesses over the past decade as part of its turnaround, but it's kept one of its oldest. The tech titan has been manufacturing mainframes since the 1950s. While the mainframe segment isn't as critical to IBM as it once was, the hulking systems are still widely used in certain industries, and each mainframe system sold generates additional revenue from software, services, and financing."", ""At the end of 2022, 45 of the world's top 50 banks used IBM's mainframe systems. Once every two and half years or so, IBM launches a new lineup of mainframes. The latest iteration, the z16, was announced in April 2022 and became available the following month."", 'The z16 came with a slew of innovations, including an integrated AI accelerator capable of running AI inferencing workloads in real time. This allowed financial institutions to use AI to analyze transactions on the fly, reducing the risk of fraud. A single z16 system could process 300 billion inference requests per day with one millisecond of latency.', 'Given the typical cadence of mainframe launches, IBM is likely to reveal its next mainframe system in the third or fourth quarter of 2024. A mainframe launch generally triggers an upgrade cycle, boosting revenue in the infrastructure segment substantially.', 'In Q3 of 2022, the first full quarter of z16 availability, sales of mainframe systems soared 98% year over year. This pushed total infrastructure revenue up 23% year over year, and it likely drove some incremental sales of software and services as well.', ""IBM's mainframe systems work well with the company's hybrid cloud platform, allowing customers to modernize their infrastructures while sticking with mainframes. One of the benefits of an IBM mainframe is longevity. An application written decades ago in COBOL, an ancient programming language that still powers many critical systems, will run on today's mainframes without issue."", ""The heavy usage of code written in COBOL is a problem for companies that are dependent on that code. COBOL isn't really taught anymore, so the pool of software engineers capable of maintaining those applications is shrinking. This situation is bad news for IBM because it could compel some customers to move away from mainframes."", 'IBM has recently come up with a solution that should help. The company launched watsonx Code Assistant for Z in October, a generative AI-powered assistant that is trained specifically to translate COBOL applications into modern Java code. This gives customers a way to modernize their software without giving up on the mainframe, and it gives IBM an additional way to generate revenue from its mainframe customer base.', ""After years of waffling between revenue growth and revenue declines, IBM is now in a good position to grow consistently, barring a severe economic downturn. The company is settling into its role of providing platforms, software, and consulting services to enterprises looking to modernize their IT infrastructures and adopt artificial intelligence technology. The mainframe itself isn't a growth business like hybrid cloud and AI, but it plays a role in both."", ""IBM expects to increase revenue by 3% to 5% this year excluding the impact of currency. A mainframe launch sometime next year will boost sales in the second half of 2024, but there are a lot of moving parts, and the company likely won't issue any guidance for 2024 until its next earnings report in January. The state of the economy is a wild card that could swing IBM's revenue by a few percentage points either way."", ""While a new mainframe will provide a temporary bump to IBM's top line, it's the company's efforts to reposition itself for the cloud and AI era that will drive growth in the long run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

The formula for this calculation on Royal Caribbean Cruises is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.099 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$33b - US$9.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Royal Caribbean Cruises has an ROCE of 9.9%.

Quote', ""NIKE is expected to have witnessed continued gains from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline in the fiscal second quarter. Gains from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, and robust digital and DTC performances are expected to have been other tailwinds.Continued strength in retail traffic trends within NIKE Direct has been boosting conversion rates. The strong member buying trends are likely to have led to a record digital performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Strength in the North America, EMEA and APLA regions, fueled by increasing traffic, higher conversion and growth in average order value, is likely to have aided sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The NIKE Direct business has been benefiting from robust growth across regions and an efficient digital ecosystem, which comprises its online site, and commercial and activity apps. Revenues at NIKE-owned stores are expected to have gained from improved traffic, higher conversion rates and growth in average order value. The NIKE Direct business is likely to have benefited from growth in North America, EMEA and APLA, offset by continued weakness in Greater China in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect total NIKE Brand revenues to increase 1.2% year over year to $12,872.7 million in the fiscal second quarter, driven by 2.2% growth in Direct-to-Consumer and a 0.5% rise in the Wholesale business.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted revenue growth to be up slightly from the prior year, owing to difficult comparisons from last year’s solid growth.However, NKE has been witnessing a decline in the gross and operating margins due to rising costs, higher markdowns, increased freight and logistic costs, elevated input costs, and currency headwinds. Also, elevated SG&A expenses are concerning.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company predicted a 100-bps improvement in the gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by gains in strategic pricing, improved markdowns and lower ocean freight rates. This is expected to have been partly offset by higher product input costs and 50 bps of negative impacts of adverse currency rates.NIKE has been witnessing elevated SG&A expenses, driven by increased demand-creation expenses due to the normalization of sporting activities and overhead costs related to higher wages. Demand-creation expenses are likely to have increased in the fiscal second quarter, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments. These investments are likely to have supported significant global sports moments and product launches, and investment in capabilities to transform NIKE's operating model for greater speed and effectiveness.Operating overhead expenses are expected to have resulted from higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected second-quarter fiscal 2024 SG&A expenses to increase in the mid to high-single digits, owing to increased demand creation investments.We anticipate the gross margin to expand 100 bps to 43.9%. Meanwhile, our estimate for SG&A expenses of $4,362.5 million indicates a year-over-year rise of 5.8%. We expect demand-creation expenses to increase 8% year over year and operating overheads to rise 5% year over year in the fiscal second quarter.Driven by the soft gross margin and higher SG&A expenses, our model suggests a 50-bps contraction in the operating margin to 11.4% in the fiscal second quarter."", 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NIKE this time around.

The COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020 was the quickest bear market decline in history. Meanwhile, the rallies growth-stock investors have enjoyed in 2021 and 2023 have been jaw-dropping.', ""Despite these notable gains, some of Wall Street's most followed indexes (e.g., the Nasdaq Composite) remain below their all-time closing highs. Put another way, high-quality stocks can still be purchased at a discount if you're willing to put in the work and look for bargains."", ""What's particularly noteworthy about putting your money to work on Wall Street is that prior barriers to investment have been all but torn down. Most online brokerages have completely done away with minimum-deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades executed on major U.S. exchanges. In other words, any amount of money -- even $500 -- can be the ideal amount to put to work."", ""If you have $500 that's ready to invest, and this isn't cash that'll be needed to pay bills or cover an emergency, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first genius stock you can confidently add to your portfolio with $500 is world-leading payment processor Visa (NYSE: V). Even though Visa shares are near an all-time high, the company sports a laundry list of competitive advantages that should continue to lift its valuation for years, if not decades, to come.', 'The interesting thing about Visa is that its biggest headwind is also its greatest opportunity. Like most financial stocks, Visa is cyclical. This is to say that its operating performance tends to ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. and global economy. If a recession takes place, consumer and enterprise spending would be expected to decline, leading to weaker fee collection for Visa.', 'However, the ""ebbs"" don\'t last nearly as long as the ""flows."" Only three of the 12 U.S. recessions since World War II have lasted at least one year. By comparison, most periods of expansion last multiple years, with two expansions lasting a full decade. Visa is perfectly positioned to take advantage of these extended periods of growth.', ""To add to the above point, Visa's growth runway during these long-winded expansions is enormous. As of 2021, it held a nearly 53% share of credit card network-purchase volume in the United States. Meanwhile, faster-growing emerging-market regions, including the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia, remain largely underbanked and therefore ripe for disruption by financial-services providers like Visa."", ""Something else that's been critical to Visa's long-term success is its avoidance of lending. Visa is a well-known and trusted brand, and it would likely succeed as a lender. But doing so would also expose the company to credit delinquencies and loan losses during inevitable economic slowdowns. Completely avoiding the lending arena means not having to set aside capital for potential losses. It's one of the key reasons Visa bounces back from recessions so quickly."", ""Lastly, Visa is a cash cow with a profit margin north of 50%. Although its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 is higher than the benchmark S&P 500, Visa's expected annualized earnings-growth rate of 14% over the next five years makes its stock a bargain."", 'A second no-brainer stock with an exceptionally favorable risk-versus-reward profile for patient investors is specialty healthcare company Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ).', ""The enemy of pretty much every drug developer is time. Novel therapies have finite periods of sales exclusivity. Once those periods of exclusivity end, it's not uncommon for generic drugs and/or biosimilar competition to enter the space and either siphon away sales or reduce the average selling price for a product. Jazz generates about half of its revenue from its oxybate franchise (Xywav and Xyrem), which help patients with various sleep disorders. A high concentration of sales in one franchise/area of focus can be worrisome."", ""However, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has its bases covered. The company developed a next-generation version of its narcolepsy blockbuster Xyrem. This new version, known as Xywav, contains 92% less sodium than its predecessor. Not only does this make Jazz's drug safer to take for patients with higher cardiovascular risk factors, but it'll help preserve the company's cash flow and sales exclusivity for many years to come."", ""Jazz's oncology portfolio is also gaining momentum. Cancer-drug sales look to be on track to reach $1 billion in 2023, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy Rylaze doing a lot of the heavy lifting with sales up 46% year to date to $292.5 million."", ""Cannabidiol-based drug Epidiolex is holding its own as well. Since Jazz acquired GW Pharmaceuticals in May 2021 to get its hands on Epidiolex, sales have continued to grow. Additional worldwide approvals, along with label-expansion opportunities, have the ability to eventually push Epidiolex's annual sales past $1 billion."", ""Don't overlook Jazz's pipeline, either. The company anticipates as many as five late-stage trial readouts before the end of 2024, with many of these advanced studies focused on experimental cancer drugs."", ""While Jazz Pharmaceuticals is no longer the growth juggernaut it once was, a forward P/E ratio of 6 doesn't do justice to this highly profitable biotech stock."", ""The third no-brainer stock to buy with $500 right now, conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), may not be a household name, but its billionaire CEO, Warren Buffett, certainly is. Take note, I'm specifically talking about Berkshire's Class B shares (BRK.B), since a single Class A share will set an investor back more than $544,000!"", ""Since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO in 1965, he's overseen a 19.8% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A). The Class B shares weren't issued until 1996, which is why I'm referring to returns of the Class A shares in this instance. Even if Berkshire fails to return close to 20% on an annualized basis moving forward, Buffett and his team have clearly demonstrated their ability to outpace the broader market over long periods."", 'One of the factors that makes Berkshire Hathaway such a special investment, other than Warren Buffett, is its focus on cyclical businesses.', ""Buffett and the late Charlie Munger, who served as Berkshire's vice chairman for 45 years, realized a long time ago that betting on the U.S. economy to grow over time is a smart idea. Instead of trying to guess when recessions would occur, Buffett and Munger packed Berkshire's investment portfolio and owned assets with time-tested, profitable, cyclical businesses. Thanks to extended periods of economic expansion, these long-term holdings have delivered big gains for Berkshire and its shareholders."", ""Another unsung hero for Berkshire Hathaway is the myriad of dividend stocks that sit in its investment portfolio. Over the course of the next year, Buffett and his investing aides will oversee the collection of around $6 billion in dividend income. On top of being recurringly profitable, dividend stocks have historically run circles around publicly traded companies that don't offer a payout."", ""Furthermore, the culture that Charlie Munger instilled at Berkshire Hathaway is going to live on for decades to come. While every investor would love to see Warren Buffett live to be 120, the truth is that he and Munger built Berkshire Hathaway to succeed long after they're gone. If the American economy is growing over time, there's a good chance Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries, which include insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF, as well as the company's $374 billion investment portfolio, are going to benefit."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

This had resulted in a massive drop in the prices of growth stocks. These growth stocks, in recent years, have come to dominate the US stock market, morphing into trillion dollar corporations. Growth investors had seized the opportunity to pick up the shares of firms like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) at discount prices during the rut.\xa0', 'These investors are now repairing the benefits of these trades. Per latest figures, the shares of these three firms are all up this year, by 25%, 55%, and 245% respectively. There is little doubt that these tech firms still have a formidable runway for growth. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is investing heavily in the rapidly expanding blockchain space, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is starting to realize the benefits of the entry into the massive video game business, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) looks set to be an industry leader in AI products.\xa0', 'Stocks like these, with growth prospects but solid fundamentals, generally make for the best investments in Roth IRA. Roth IRA are accounts that offer people the benefits of tax-free growth and withdrawals after retirement. Since equity investments are also covered under these benefits, many investors are on the lookout for a reasonable stock that offers growth potential but has a strong core business. They are inspired by Peter Thiel, an investor who turned his $2,000 Roth IRA equity investment into a billion dollar retirement plan.\xa0', 'The growth prospects offered by tech behemoths can be understood in greater detail by following the business plans of these firms. Colette Kress, the CFO of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recently outlined these during the third quarter earnings call. Kress highlighted how the hardware products of the firm were essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures, and the firm planned to ramp up the production of these AI chips heading into 2024.\xa0', '“The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants with their pipelines. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla and autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our data center revenue in the quarter.', 'Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances and high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities.”', 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that have long-term growth catalysts, dividend growth history, solid business fundamentals, and positive analyst coverage were selected for the list.

Here is what the fund said:', '“A higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 \xa0', 'AT&T Inc.

Banks have been working for centuries to manage money and make payments for businesses, and throughout its history, the industry has had to keep up with the times. To understand just how old the finance system is, consider the world's largest private bank in terms of assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JPMorgan traces its history back to the days of the American Revolution, as it was acquired by Chase Manhattan bank in 2000 to become the biggest bank holding company in the U.S. Chase Manhattan itself was initially set up in 1799, making it one of the oldest banks in the world. However, JPMorgan isn't the oldest bank in the world, with one of the oldest financial institutions being Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.\xa0 - a state owned Italian bank that was set up in 1624 and traced its roots back to 1472."", ""The world, if you're unaware, has significantly changed since 1472. Now, banks and financial institutions process thousands of transactions daily and move money thousands of miles across the world. Similarly, companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) have leveraged technology to serve a larger number of people who are covered by the financial system. Banking, like gasoline, is a commodity and the lack of access to a bank account often means that people cannot perform or earn to their full potential. After all, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is unlikely to pay its employees hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in cash, and anyone who cannot open a bank account often misses out on financial opportunities."", ""The intersection of the finance industry and modern day computing technology is dubbed 'fintech'. Short form for financial technology, the fintech sector is simply defined as the use of technology to steal market share away from traditional financial providers when it comes to managing finances for businesses or enabling consumers to spend, save, or earn their money. Naturally, this potential of being able to cater to millions of consumers and businesses means that the right financial technology companies can be quite valuable."", ""As an illustration, consider the consulting firm McKinsey's estimate of the total market value of publicly traded fintech companies as of July 2023. According to the firm, these companies were worth $550 billion, a two fold increase over the four years since 2019.

That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Snap-On, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business.

', 'The company aims to keep increasing its payouts by 5% to 9% annually. Its revenue growth drivers include inflation-linked rate increases, development projects, and acquisitions.

It's a leading provider of mobile and broadband services. Those businesses generate tremendous cash flows, giving the company the funds to invest in growing its business (5G), pay a steadily rising dividend, and maintain a strong balance sheet. Verizon delivered its 17th straight annual dividend hike in 2023. "", ""That steady upward trend should continue. The telecom recently passed the peak investment phase for its 5G network, which will free up additional cash flow that it can use for debt reduction. Falling debt and its cost-cutting initiatives should further boost its cash flow. Meanwhile, its 5G investments are driving revenue growth as more customers upgrade to that faster network. Verizon's growing cash flow and falling debt levels will put it in an even better position to continue increasing its dividends in the future."", 'Energy Transfer, Clearway Energy, Realty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Verizon are excellent dividend stocks.

The “father-knows-best” approach of the CEOs of yore when chiefs dictated all the shots has proven even less effective in leading. Good leadership knows when to defer to those who do know best.', 'Take Coach and Kate Spade owner Tapestry. CEO Joanne Crevoiserat had to navigate the abrupt departure of her predecessor, the second CEO exit in as many years, as interim chief in the summer of 2020 when the fashion company was trying to reinvigorate its Kate Spade brand and protect its Coach brand’s comeback. Crevoiserat moved quickly on a turnaround plan she had already been working on as CFO to make the company less reliant on stores for selling and marketing to customers, something the closings of its stores for weeks in the spring of 2020 made abundantly clear. To do that, Tapestry let people closer to the front lines at the brand level call more shots. “We had incredibly talented teams that we had to empower and enable to make decisions to innovate and that was happening so fast through COVID,” Crevoiserat told Fortune in October.', ""Over at Coty, the beauty company behind Kylie Jenner’s brands and Cover Girl, Sue Nabi came in after it went through five CEOs in five years, none of whom came from the beauty industry, making the rank-and-file question the company's raison d’être. While Nabi is very involved in product development and marketing, she made clear that Coty would tap its people’s expertise in beauty more fully. “I explained how passionate I am about beauty. The feedback was incredible because this was the first time the CEO spoke to them not about the P&L, what we need to do next week, next quarter, and so on, but about a vision, a passion, and how intuition is essential in our business,” Nabi told Fortune in October."", 'One of CEOs’ favorite clichés to trot out is that turmoil can create a big opportunity to improve. The urgency of the pandemic led many companies to test that adage out. That often meant speeding up initiatives that had previously been wending their way slowly through a corporation’s bureaucracy.', 'At UPS, for example, during the height of the pandemic, the newly minted CEO Carol Tomé recognized that the company wasn’t getting deliveries to its small and medium-sized business clients as quickly as its competitors. “We had launched an initiative to tackle that problem, but we weren’t planning to complete it until June 2021,” Tomé previously told Fortune. In the spring of 2020, just after she was hired, Tomé asked her team what was getting in the way of moving on that speed-of-delivery goal immediately and learned the problem was funding. “We’ve got money, let’s accelerate it,” she responded. The company completed that project in six months instead of 18 and saw market share increases for several subsequent quarters.', 'Meanwhile Clorox had the opposite challenge, when its wipes became the must-have item for U.S. consumers and sent sales growth to nearly unmanageable levels. “We have historically been a company very good at managing a very steady growth rate, and then managing through those smaller cyclical periods. And what we need to get better at is managing through volatility,” Clorox CEO Linda Rendle told Fortune in 2022. Now of course, she’s dealing with a crisis of another sort: a cyber attack in summer led to double-digit plunges in sales after it tripped up Clorox’ manufacturing.', 'While some CEOs are shrewd long-term thinkers and others excel in the heat of the day-to-day, successful pandemic-class CEOs made their mark by deftly switching between both modes. “They were able to zoom back and forth between the 50,000-foot level and the 200-foot level,” says David Reimer, CEO and founder of The ExCo Group, an executive search firm. “They got involved in a level of detail and running the company that most of them thought they probably left behind years earlier,” he adds.', ""Bill McDermott remembers the day he had to adjust his field of vision, shortly after he became CEO of the enterprise software maker ServiceNow. “We had a blue-sky-thinking meeting in 2020 to talk about what we were going to be when we grew up,” he told Fortune. “I walked into a boardroom to talk with my leaders, and I'm like, ‘Guys, look, if we don't solve for COVID, we'll never be a great company. We'll never be a great brand. So let's just kill all the slides.’”"", 'Within a week, ServiceNow had produced a guide to returning to work safely and made it widely available to businesses and the public sector. “We got the entire engineering machine, the entire go-to-market machine, focused only on that,” McDermott says, “and that made us a sensation.”', 'In theory, stakeholder capitalism was a creditable concept by the spring of 2020; in practice, it was “dismissible,” says ExCo Group’s Reimer. But just as nobody saw the pandemic coming, he tells Fortune, nobody could imagine “the degree to which stakeholder capitalism would just overwhelm the office of the CEO.”', ""With COVID bringing illness, grief, and immeasurable stress into employees’ lives, CEOs received a crash course on the necessity of putting shareholder supremacy aside and leading with what some academics call an “ethics of care” philosophy. The most admired world and business leaders took a human and employee-centered approach to their policies, David McGuire, a professor of human resources management at Edinburgh Napier University and co-author of Leadership in a Post-Covid Pandemic World, explains. In the pandemic’s wake, CEOs now talk about stewardship and servant leadership, he adds, “and the whole idea of stewardship and being a servant is you're sometimes putting other people first.”"", 'Paul Knopp, CEO of KPMG US, was among those first-time chief executives who saw employees leap to the top of his priorities list at the beginning of his stint in 2020. The KPMG insider—he had spent 36 years at the firm—officially took control in July of that year. “I certainly understood the gravity of the moment and what I was taking on,” he told Fortune. Demonstrating empathy for employees’ experiences in a time of uncertainty was paramount, particularly following the racial reckoning that erupted in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. The new CEO decided that improving diversity in KPMG’s top ranks would be his leadership team’s legacy issue and his first order of business. After consulting with underrepresented employees at the firm, his team spent a month working intensely to create a program to make that happen. At KPMG, underrepresented groups now make up 46.8% of partners and managing directors, up from 39.3% in 2020 when Knopp took over, according to a company spokesperson.', ""During the early months of the pandemic, geopolitical dynamics and the global economic outlook became unpredictable. The CEOs who took over then inherited a world that looked nothing like the one they grew up with, says Reimer, and the wisest leaders recognized that “there's no one person in any organization of any size” who could manage the world’s new complexity."", '“People who came in feeling like the job of the CEO is to provide answers got in real trouble fairly quickly,” says Reimer.', 'Boards came to the same realization, he adds, and many companies abandoned their original successor candidates, skipping names of some rising stars on their lists to find those executives who would lead like player-coaches, not autocrats.', ""The best pandemic-class CEOs are the opposite of micromanagers, says Tierney Remick, co-leader of Korn Ferry's global board and CEO practice. Instead, they empower their teams, setting a new standard for their C-Suite colleagues. “CEOs who have been very effective in the last several years have made sure that everybody on the C-Suite team was thinking of the enterprise end to end,” she says. Rather than focus solely on their personal departments or lines of business, Remmick adds, senior leaders were encouraged to think: “We're all linked and we all need to lean in together.”"", 'Three years out since the pandemic’s beginning, one thing that is clear is that the presence of crises is not going away, and CEOs have to adjust their style accordingly, says Jason Baumgarten, head of executive search firm Spencer Stuart’s global CEO and boards practice. “You have to have a more agile style of leadership that isn’t just about making a decision quickly,” he suggests. “It’s about knowing how you set up the organization and what permissions you give for decision-making further from the center.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock almost tripled in the first 3 quarters of this year with a 197% gain, and a large reason for this is the huge role they have played in recent AI improvements. Nvidia’s single GPU AI training speed performance has increased by a dramatic 1000x in 10 years with only 2.5x coming from Moore’s Law3 driven increases in chip density. Besides better chip manufacturing, there were three other improvement factors at play: simplifications in number representation for the weights of the neural networks, more complex mathematical instructions for reducing the computational overhead involved in mathematical calculations, and increased neuron sparsity (in neural networks, some neurons are useless and can be pruned from the network without reducing performance significantly). In addition to these single GPU improvements, Nvidia also made improvements in data center scale architecture that allows groups of GPUs to work more efficiently together.', 'It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the improvement came from hardware architectural and software data improvements, rather than transition density. These improvements were likely the low-hanging fruit of training speed improvements as researchers will eventually converge on an ideal architecture. The simplification of going from 32-bit to 8-bit floating point numbers for measuring weights is a one-time gain that can’t be repeated again. I expect the rate of improvement to slow down over the next ten years and eventually approach the levels of Moore’s Law improvements in chip efficiency.

More specifically, consensus estimates forecast Nvidia's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 103% over the next five years. That would be more than double the 48% CAGR Nvidia's bottom line has clocked in the past five years."", ""A closer look at Nvidia's key growth drivers will tell us exactly why its bottom-line growth is expected to step on the gas over the next five years."", ""Nvidia was a much smaller company five years ago. It generated just under $12 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019 (which ended in January 2019 and coincided with 11 months of calendar year 2018). Gaming was Nvidia's biggest business segment at that time, accounting for 53% of its top line, while the data center business produced a quarter of its total revenue five years ago."", ""The situation has changed dramatically since then. The company now gets 80% of its revenue from selling graphics processing units (GPU) for the data center market. Gaming is now a smaller component, with just under 16% of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue. Still, Nvidia is the leader in both of these markets."", ""According to third-party estimates, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and it has a similar position in the market for discrete graphics cards that are deployed in PCs. The good news is that both of these markets are built for solid growth over the next five years. According to Nvidia's peer Advanced Micro Devices, the AI chip market could generate annual revenue of $400 billion in 2027, up nearly 10x from this year's $45 billion."", ""On the other hand, the gaming GPU market is forecast to grow at an annual pace of almost 34% through the end of 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. The cloud gaming market, which is forecast to clock annual growth of 39% through 2028 and generate annual revenue of $23 billion at the end of the forecast period, could be another catalyst for Nvidia given the company's dominant position in this space."", 'More importantly, Nvidia has been taking steps to ensure that it remains the leading player in these markets by way of its product development moves. The company has already accelerated its product roadmap in AI chips, and it is reportedly going to make its next-generation gaming cards on a more advanced 3-nanometer (nm) process as compared to the current RTX 40-series processors that are made on a 5nm process.', ""A smaller manufacturing node should ideally allow Nvidia's new gaming chips to pack more computing power and consume less electricity at the same time. This explains why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, from whom Nvidia sources its chips, claims that the 3nm chips could boost performance by 15% and lower power consumption by 30% as compared to the 5nm chips."", ""All this indicates that Nvidia is setting itself up to make the most of the impressive growth in the key end markets that contribute significantly to its business. That's why it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings indeed growing at a much faster pace over the next five years as compared to the past five."", ""Nvidia is on track to finish fiscal 2024 with revenue of $59 billion. That translates into a five-year revenue CAGR of 38% using the company's fiscal 2019 revenue of $11.7 billion as the base. For comparison, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to be much faster over the next couple of years, as the following chart indicates."", ""The company is expected to generate almost $108 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026. That points toward a three-year revenue CAGR of 58% using the fiscal 2023 revenue of $27 billion as the base. If we assume that Nvidia's annual growth slows down to even 30% in the three fiscal years following fiscal 2026, its top line could hit $237 billion in fiscal 2029."", ""Nvidia has a five-year price-to-sales ratio of 20.

The company's stock has more than doubled in 2023, up some 115% since Jan. 1. Meanwhile, it appears to be making promising headway in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market."", ""The company's biggest competitor, Nvidia, has enjoyed soaring earnings this year thanks to a spike in demand for AI chips. Nvidia's performance over the last 12 months could mean big things for AMD in 2024 as AMD plans to launch a powerful new graphics processing unit (GPU). If AMD can replicate even a portion of Nvidia's success in the industry, the company could expect major gains next year."", ""As a result, now is the perfect time to learn more about this tech giant and determine whether it's worth adding to your portfolio. So, is AMD's stock a buy now? Let's take a look."", ""Many companies across tech have restructured their businesses to focus on AI in 2023, with several venturing into the hardware side of the industry. Tech firms like Intel, Amazon, and Microsoft all have plans to eventually challenge Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and take a slice of the lucrative market."", 'However, AMD likely has the best chance to thrive in the arena thanks to its years of being the second-biggest name in GPUs (second only to Nvidia). AMD has the brand recognition and infrastructure in place to catch up to its primary rival far quicker than other competitors.', ""AMD launched its MI300X AI GPU on Dec. 6. The new chip is reportedly faster than Nvidia's H100 GPU, offering up to 60% increased performance. If it can deliver competitive price-to-performance, AMD could see significant revenue gains over the next year."", ""Microsoft's Azure has already signed on to become the first cloud platform to use the chip. Meanwhile, Meta, Broadcom, and Cisco have partnered with AMD to build advanced AI systems."", 'The AI market exploded in 2023 and has shown no signs of slowing. Nvidia may have gotten a head start, but AMD looks likely to make a big splash next year, and you might not want to miss out on its growth potential.', ""AMD's stock has skyrocketed this year, but its earnings still have yet to see a return on the chipmaker's heavy investment in AI. The chart below reflects this, with the company's free cash flow plunging nearly 60% year to date while Nvidia's more than tripled."", ""In the third quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 4% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $110 million. The growth was mainly owed to a 42% increase in AMD's client segment, which benefited from improvements in the personal computer market."", ""However, AMD's data center sales crucially fell about 1% as Nvidia cornered the market on chips. For reference, Nvidia's data center segment posted a 206% increase in revenue for the same quarter. The newly released MI300X could trigger a spike in AMD's data center revenue next year. However, until then, its stock might be too expensive to justify."", ""The tables above compare AMD's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow against the same metrics for some of the biggest names in AI right now. AMD has the highest figures on both fronts by a significant margin, meaning its stock offers the least value out of all these companies."", ""AMD is on a promising growth trajectory and will likely flourish over the long term. However, its high valuation is hard to justify with options like Alphabet and Microsoft as alternative ways to invest in AI. Even Nvidia's high stock price is more attractive, with better valuation metrics and a more established position in the industry."", ""It's wise to keep AMD on your radar to strike when the time is right, but cheaper options are too good to pass up for now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 88% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 3.1% last week. However, the 20% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. But they would probably be wary of future losses.', ""Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about McKesson."", ' Check out our latest analysis for McKesson ', 'Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""We can see that McKesson does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McKesson, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McKesson Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company.

In this article, we decided to focus on Air Products and Chemicals'  ROE."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Air Products and Chemicals is:', '15% = US$2.3b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.15 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.

You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. ', 'Air Products and Chemicals has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 64%, meaning that it is left with only 36% to reinvest into its business.

Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 51%. Still, forecasts suggest that Air Products and Chemicals' future ROE will rise to 21% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much."", ""On the whole, we do feel that Air Products and Chemicals has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits.

However, it’s been a year of announcement in terms of some of the biggest hydrogen projects in the world. I would say that a strong stage is being set for stellar growth in the hydrogen economy beyond the current decade. Hence, this is why we made our list of undervalued hydrogen stocks.', 'To put things into perspective, more than 1,000 hydrogen projects have been announced globally. Of this, at least 795 are on course for full or partial deployment by 2030. Further, these projects involve an investment of $320 billion.', 'It’s clear from these facts that the hydrogen economy is at an inflection point. As construction is executed in various projects, the next few years will be characterized by robust revenue growth. It’s therefore a good time to consider exposure to some of the best and attractively valued hydrogen stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Let’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these three names from the perspective of value creation.', 'Source: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com', 'Linde (NASDAQ:LIN) stock has been in an uptrend for year-to-date. I however believe that the 1.25% dividend yield stock remains attractively valued. With some ambitious hydrogen projects, Linde seems poised for healthy growth in the coming years.', 'As an overview, Linde is a leading industrial gases and engineering company. The company has been focusing on hydrogen projects. Linde is involved in the production, distribution and refueling of blue and green hydrogen.', 'Recently, Linde announced that it has increased the liquid hydrogen production capacity at Alabama to 30 tons per day of liquid hydrogen. Furthermore, the company has also proposed a $1 billion Arizona hydrogen project.', 'It’s worth noting that Linde has a strong balance sheet and high financial flexibility. Over the next decade, the company is targeting an investment of $50 billion in clean energy projects. I am therefore bullish on LIN stock as the hydrogen economy gets bigger in the coming years.', 'Source: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.com', 'Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) stock is another blue-chip name that’s investing heavily in hydrogen projects. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.6, APD stock looks attractive and offers a dividend yield of 2.65%. It’s worth noting that the stock has been sideways in the last six months. I expect a breakout rally relatively soon.', 'Coming to investments, Air Products has committed $15 billion towards clean energy projects through 2027. The NEOM Green project is expected to be the world’s largest green hydrogen project. In the United States, Air Products has partnered with AES Corporation to build the largest green hydrogen facility. The company will also be building Europe’s largest blue hydrogen plant that will be commercialized by 2026.', 'The key point is that Air Product has some big investments in the pipeline. Furthermore, the company has high financial flexibility to execute the project on time. Big investments will translate into earnings growth and potential upside for APD stock. You can see why we put this on our list of undervalued hydrogen stocks.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'I have focused on blue-chip names among hydrogen stocks. However, investors with a high risk appetite can consider some exposure to Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock. It’s worth noting that PLUG stock has plunged by 67% for year-to-date.', 'The reasons include reliance of potential hydrogen subsidies for growth. Further, financing ambitious growth plans and execution remains a question. However, if Plug Power can navigate through this headwind, the stock can be a five to 10-bagger. Therefore, some exposure makes sense at current levels of $3.9.', 'From a growth perspective, Plug Power expects revenue of $1.2 billion this year. The target is to achieve revenue of $6 billion and $20 billion respectively by 2027 and 2030. Of course, the target seems steep, but is not unrealistic considering the impending growth in the hydrogen economy. It however remains to be seen if Plug Power can execute the big plans.\xa0This easily earns its spot on our list of undervalued hydrogen stocks.', 'On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Robinson’s new CEO doubling down on lean management, large language models",FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-ceo-doubling-172736619.html,1703006856,STORY,"['CHRW', 'CAT']","['When C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) announced its next CEO was Ford executive Dave Bozeman, insiders likely had questions galore. The biggest, perhaps, was: How is he going to fix this company?', 'On Monday, during a very rainy day in New York City, I met with Bozeman to answer just that. He spent 45 minutes answering my questions on how he’s going to reinvent the massive freight brokerage C.H. Robinson.', 'Robinson is in need of a turnaround plan. The freight brokerage failed to fully capitalize on the massive upcycle in freight in 2020 and 2021. Instead, Robinson appeared to just run up its costs. Robinson’s previous CEO, Bob Biesterfeld, had admitted that Robinson hired too much during the freight bubble of the early 2020s. When demand suddenly and precipitously declined in the spring of 2022, Robinson was caught with too many employees and too few loads to move. Analysts have also pointed out that, under Biesterfeld, Robinson invested massively in technology, with results that weren’t commensurate.', 'On Jan. 3, Robinson announced that Biesterfeld had resigned as CEO and from the board — ending a stretch at the company that lasted more than two decades.', 'The rest of 2023 has proved to be brutal. In the first nine months of 2023, compared to the previous year, income from operations dropped from $421 million to $63 million, an 85% decline.', 'Robinson’s board deliberated for months, it seems, on who would be the next CEO, as FreightWaves’ Mark Solomon reported. Insiders told Solomon that former UPS COO Jim Barber was a likely pick.', '', 'So many were likely surprised when Robinson plucked Bozeman instead. He’s an outsider to Robinson and the traditional freight brokerage world alike. However, he has served in executive roles at Ford (NYSE: F), Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG). Perhaps most notable is his five years at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), where he built the retailer’s middle-mile delivery network.', 'Robinson’s stock dropped 6.4% on June 5, when the freight brokerage announced Bozeman as its next CEO. As Susquehanna’s Bascome Majors pointed out, that may be because “a clear ‘slash and burn’ hire would have driven a short-term pop, and Mr. Bozeman’s resume doesn’t fit that narrative (on paper at least).”', 'While insiders may have questioned Bozeman’s lack of Robinson background, it seems that having something of a “beginner’s mind” to deep-seated issues in brokerage could be more conducive to actually getting those problems solved. As he said at one point in the interview, Robinson’s culture has “gone from admiring problems to solving problems.”', 'I wanted to know more about Bozeman’s long-term plan to rebuild Robinson. The gist is that the company isn’t shying away from technology investment yet — but it will seek to lower head counts. Still, Bozeman doesn’t think that deep knowledge can be entirely replaced by technology. That would be good news for Wall Street and Robinson’s 15,500 employees alike.', 'This interview transcript has been edited for clarity and condensed.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: Obviously you’ve had a long career at Amazon, Caterpillar and Harley-Davidson, but you’re new to the brokerage side. What’s the competitive advantage around being in the shipper space for so long and then now coming into the brokerage side?', 'BOZEMAN: There’s a few things here. Sharpening my knife at Harley-Davidson, it was getting into good Midwestern engineering, manufacturing and honing your skill set around people development, people leadership and then execution. Those were my early days. That played on both the product and operation side, so you had that kind of balance.', 'Going to Caterpillar, it would’ve been pulling in that global mindset, but also driving sharp financial bottom-line type of execution. I launched the lean execution operational excellence. This would have been starting to hone the skills of the lean talents within Caterpillar. I spent three and a half years in the executive office of Cat. I had the logistics part within Caterpillar as well, so dealing with all of the big steam shippers. I was responsible for that logistics arm at a big level, but as you say from a shipper perspective.', 'Then going to Amazon was interesting in taking on that mission of building out its middle mile. It was kind of a hybrid of building this asset-light versus asset-medium type of world. The asset-light, where the brokerage part came in, was building out Relay and standing up Amazon Freight, Amazon shipping and the technology that goes with that. Those are really the basic building blocks of connecting freight from origin to destination. That’s what the technology play was on Relay.', 'The more asset-heavy part is we procured almost 67,000 trailers within Amazon. That’s what you see going on the road today, both power and trailers. Having that understanding of the asset side plus building out the technology on what you would call the asset-light side really started to form my experience around that space.', 'Ford was a short stop — getting back into more of the product and global customer service, in which you really start talking about the next level of electrification and things of that nature.Bring all of that together and you come into Robinson. That culmination of experience really has you familiar with the asset shipper side, but also that asset-light side and understanding.', 'Some things don’t change and it’s really about that execution. As I tell the team, it’s inputs and outputs. Understanding those predictable inputs will drive you into predictable outputs. That’s what a lot of my experience has been in driving into that. I think it’s proven really quite convenient coming into Robinson with that.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: I read in the initial announcement of your appointment to the position that you have a background in “reinventing complex operating models.” What needs to be reimagined or looked at again at C.H. Robinson?', 'BOZEMAN: It’s a tough market right now, and I would almost say it’s a complex market. Coming off of the pandemic, you have different buying patterns from end users to different shipping patterns.', 'With the advent of large language models, how do you reinvent and think about that? We’re actually starting to do that.', 'In our world, unstructured data is a big deal. We have 500,000 unstructured data points that come at us daily. You look at that and say, “Hey, what are you going to do about that?” We’re not just talking about large language models, we’re doing them, and I’m a big proponent of driving that. I’m all for technology and really driving things.', 'Using this generative AI and large language models, we’re able to now start tapping into those 500,000 unstructured data points.', 'BOZEMAN: We have 100,000 customers. Some of those customers are not going to have the technology needed to plug right into us and have that instant connection. So they send us an email — unstructured data point. Typically, you would have humans having to go and parse that information out, make it correct, so it can plug into our system and be actionable.', 'Say we can quote by using this large language model. It’s able to see that email, parse that information out, jump into Navisphere, jump back out and do a quote in less than a minute, which is where our bar is.', 'I think you can see in the industry that a total digital solution is not the business model that works here. Freight is hard and it’s hard because of disruptions. [You have to have] people, who have experiences and deep relationships and technology, which is a force multiplier. It allows our people to take away that unstructured model activity so they can just be working on customer-facing strategic solutions. That’s a way of reimagining different things.', 'BOZEMAN: I think another example I would give you is just kind of reimagining how we show up as an organization, as a company. Our competitors don’t have all of the elements we have to solve sophisticated logistical solutions for customers.', 'Global forwarding, customs consolidation and warehousing, surface transportation, taking all of those things and reimagining how we stitch those together for the customer to generate more value, it takes a different conversation than what we’re doing.', 'Now, I am pleased that 50% of our revenues as you know comes from our customers who use both Global Forwarding and NAST [North American Surface Transportation] services. That’s great, but I also say that there’s some we’re probably leaving on the table.', 'As I go out — and I’ve spent this last six months talking to investors and customers and employees — customers will say, “Dave, we love Robinson. We love that you guys work with us and the solutions.” But they’re desiring even more solutions and for things that they don’t even know. We can provide that and I think it’s a competitive advantage that our competitors may have a slice of what we do.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: Are there any sort of departments where you’re looking and thinking, “OK, we need to restructure this from top to bottom”? Or there’s something economically or physically that doesn’t seem to be clicking here?', 'BOZEMAN: I’m pretty pragmatic when I go through and diagnose across the portfolios and across people, across products and processes. I would say that there’s products and processes that I looked up and said, “We need to redo this.” You have to say why, you don’t just redo it to just redo it. It’s about solving specific problems.', 'I have gone in and there are some things that we look at and say, “Hey, those processes are either not solving the problem that they were intended to solve, we’re not fast enough in softening or we’re not inventive enough.”', 'We’ve looked at a number of those things and I’m pretty happy that the culture is kind of shifting now. It’s a culture that has kind of gone from admiring problems to solving problems. It goes back to my tech days of identifying problems fast, innovating fast and executing fast — because time is money in our business.', 'As you look at the various portfolios, you just go through top to bottom and it’s really just about solving, identifying problems, putting them on the table. Every company has this issue and can get better at it. It’s identifying the root cause of your problems no matter how ugly they are, but putting them on the table and then solving them with the proper debate and the proper innovations. We’re moving to that culture to do that. It’s something that I require. That’s my bar.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: Is there any sort of example portfolio that comes to mind that you’d be able to share where these sorts of problems have been diagnosed and solved or are in the process of being solved?', 'BOZEMAN: For all of our areas, there’s something to be solved. There’s something in NAST that we have to solve, obviously. Global Forwarding, managed services, Robinson Fresh, there were things in there that we had to solve all the way. In our managed service business is our 4PL. We feel really good about the 4PL space that we’re in. We’re looking at that to see what’s the maximum breadth that we’re getting out of that business and what we’re doing. I love the stickiness of it and what customers desire for.', 'In NAST, obviously that’s the big part of the company. We’re truckload, LTL, ocean and air. In NAST, there’s a tremendous amount of things that we’re going through and really shoring up, everything from our technology stack and the speed that we use that technology stack on to processes, to technology adoption. Small changes in NAST are big changes for the company. The good part is that people feel really good about it. You could start off and it’s uncomfortable, but uncomfortable turns to excitement when we really see what can change as we’re doing it.', 'In Global Forwarding, we’re looking at our lanes. It is an ever-changing marketplace right now with nearshoring happening. We have to think about how we adapt and maximize our efforts around the constantly dynamic world economy. There’s a move to get more nearshoring. We have to adjust how we service that for customers and we are servicing that and I think we’re in a position to do that.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: Is there any sort of example in NAST you could point out?', 'BOZEMAN: Visibility is huge for us. Traceability was a big one within NAST, and it was actually one that was one that the company was a little hesitant on. Why? Because in order to have our carriers, and we have a lot of carriers, to do business with us on our platform, and you want visibility, you have to put in rules and you have to be pretty straightforward on those rules.', 'The natural nervousness around that is if you do that, you have people fall out because they don’t want to adhere to some of those rules.', 'Ultimately, I always say, “Build a product that you can be proud of and stand on that product.” We built a product that we could be proud of and then we could stand on our product. We made the call to say, “This is what’s going to be required for you to do business on our platform.”', 'Well, listen, the next day the sun rose and the world continued.', 'I would venture to say that people like the change and they like doing business with us on that. And what did that do? It gave a tremendous amount of execution on track and trace and visibility, which is obviously something good for customers and what they would desire as far as feature sets.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: The track and trace question is interesting because I’ve definitely heard that hesitancy from folks on the carrier side as well as on the broker, shipper and tech side. But at a certain point, if people want this technology, something’s got to happen.', 'BOZEMAN: For us at scale, it’s really, really important. If you’re a customer, we can let you know where your product is, but more importantly the disruptions that may happen. We’re now tracking about 98.2% confidence that we can tell customers if their product is going to be on time, because we could see disruptions.', 'Let’s say the border is locked down and there’s something going on. If we have to switch to an air mode, we move to an air mode. If we have to switch to a different port, we’ll switch to a different port. Giving that visibility to customers, they’ve told us that’s very, very important and extremely valuable.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: Having this email sent to some sort of large language model, what does that look like? What’s an example situation where maybe that email would get lost or not used and, instead, C.H. Robinson can use that and sort of reimagine some process differently?', 'BOZEMAN: One of the things I’ve said is that we’re going to have a 15% improvement in productivity this year. We were at 18% at the end of the third quarter. We feel good that we’re going to be at 15% at the end of the year, but we’re also saying we’re going to carry that momentum into 2024. We’re going to do another 15%.', 'Now, it’s not like the world is getting sunnier out there. We’re fighting through a freight recession and we’re going to do that, but we’re still going to drive another 15% productivity. That gives you a CAGR of 32% in a couple of years and we’ll continue to go from there.', 'How are we able to do that? Taking away a lot of that unstructured data work. Now, if a human has to do it, and we’re really good with our people, you’re still going to have mistakes. It is time. You’re going to have people going back and figuring things out.', 'By having and leaning into large language models and letting it do that work, our people are then able to be freed up and focus on the customer-facing strategic problems.', 'More importantly, that allows us to think differently on our attrition. We don’t have to backfill on a number of different things, we can take resources and put them into other areas that are of importance. It just allows the company to be more efficient. You’re seeing that show up in our numbers that we’re putting out there, but that’s a huge part of it.', '[NOTE FROM FREIGHTWAVES: Robinson reported a head count of 15,577 as of Sept. 30. That same date last year, Robinson employed 18,045. The biggest reduction in head count came from North American Surface Transportation, or NAST.]', 'FREIGHTWAVES: Let’s say I’m a carrier. I email a broker saying I’m delayed because I ran out of hours. Would an email like that be deployed or incorporated into this large language model?\xa0', 'BOZEMAN: Flip it the other way. First of all, that does happen, but it’s probably going to happen on a chat that comes in. The person on the desk is seeing that chat and they can respond to that chat. It could come in on an email and we could process that, but let me give you a better example.', 'When someone comes in and they say, “Hey, I need a load to go from North Carolina to New Mexico,” they send an email because they’re a medium-sized customer and they’re putting an email in that says, “Hey, I’d like a quote on North Carolina to New Mexico.”', 'That quote has to have a number of different elements in order to make it a bookable load. You have to have certain numbers in there, things about the carrier.', 'When they send an email, before someone would take that email, they may have to print that email out. They’d have to then go look and they’d pull out a highlighter and say, “Let me have to carry a number here. Oh, let me bounce that up against their history and what they did. Oh, go to the process. Let me go in and see what we have available for a quote.”', 'The amount of time when you say, “OK, now let’s send you an email back on what that quote is,” versus now doing this in under a minute with a large language model is game changing at our scale.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: So instead, the large language model would instantly reply saying, “How many years have you been in service? What’s your insurance, this, that or the other?”', 'BOZEMAN: It’s going to go in even more than that. If you ever did business with us before, it’s going to find it, it’s going to put your numbers in there, it’s going to put in all the background information. It will send you back and say, “Hey, this is the quote for that origin destination.”', 'You’ll obviously be able to confirm your key identifying information, and it even has the ability to kind of do that in a conversational manner.', 'BOZEMAN: I don’t want you to walk away from it thinking that that’s everything. We have fantastic, awesome people that then use this technology to assist, and I do these things called gembas, which in the lean world means “go see” or “go see the work.”', 'I’m looking to see what are the error states? What’s the life of a load? What’s the work that we’re actually doing in detail where I could ask questions?', 'It was a bit odd that the CEO was sitting at a terminal for two hours with someone. But to show you this example, we had a wonderful employee out in our Chicago area. He had all of his screens, and he was talking to me, “Mr. Bozeman, this is what I’m doing.” He said, “Excuse me, pardon me, I have to book this load.” And he did it very fast and he turned to me and he kept explaining what he was doing. In our conversation 30 seconds later, he said, “Pardon me, I have to remove that load.” I said, “What do you mean? Why did you have to take that off?” He said, “Because it won’t fit.” And I said, “What do you mean it won’t fit?”', 'He said, “No, it’s a loose load. I know this carrier. I know this load, and as I was thinking about it, it won’t fit. And when they show up, then that’s just going to cause double payment, waste, frustration for the customer.”', 'At that moment, I thought about it and I said, “That’s the power of people and technology.” If I had just let an algorithm do that, it would’ve booked that load and it would not have had the experience and understanding of a unique situation or disruption, and this is why a digital-only play doesn’t work in this industry.', 'FREIGHTWAVES: If you could summarize C.H. Robinson’s comeback plan, in one to two minutes, how would you summarize it?', 'BOZEMAN: We’re using the power of technology, the power of process development and product development to put us in a position to satisfy demand while keeping a very competitive cost basis. That gets us a wonderful return for investors, it gives us value for customers and solutions for customers, it gets us engagement and rewards for our employees and it gets us an awesome experience for our carriers.', 'We are in a really strong pole position for when the market pivots. Bringing a lean focus in the company has been strong. It’s something that I like and I’m trained in. But having the company really grab that and drive better problem solving, better execution, faster clock speed, all only delivers better value, more wallet share out of customers, more solutions for customers and better returns for investors and our employees. That’s how I would sum that up.', 'What do you think of Bozeman’s turnaround strategy for Robinson? Email rpremack@freightwaves.com.

Between solar and wind energies, the former outshined the latter by large in January-August 2023 as it saw substantial growth. Utility-scale solar increased by 36% and small-scale by 20%, adding 9GW of solar capacity. In comparison, wind-generated a mere 2.8GW, trimming 57% off in the same period.', 'Solar’s growth was driven by federal investments in clean energy and the increasing demand for decarbonization from public and private entities. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) resulted in increased funding in specific areas. So, the clean hydrogen and storage sectors could also grow in 2024.', 'The Acts have created funding and tax incentives that could drive third-party-owned solar projects and make green hydrogen more cost-competitive. However, it presumes the Treasury Department will provide favorable guidance to unlock more investments and stimulate the hourly Renewable Energy Credit (REC) market. For context, clean hydrogen funding increased by 222% and storage by 51% since the IIJA/IRA’s inception.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Even the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that the future might belong to other facets of the energy sector. According to the agency, utility-scale, which includes storage and clean hydrogen, will continue to prosper at a projected growth of 17% next year.

It went from lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion and other high-power-density batteries and rigs.', 'The shift comes at a time when there is a growing demand for solutions in energy storage.

If you want to skip our overview of what a metaverse is and the latest news, then take a look at the 5 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks To Buy. ', 'The metaverse is a new technological sector that aims to transport humans into the digital realm. Ever since the personal computer became popular in the 1990s, and 3D graphics cards started to make their way into the market during the same time period, humans have used a virtual experience for their entertainment in the form of video games. In fact, the global video game market is worth a whopping $224 billion as of 2022 end, and it is estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5% to be worth $610 billion by 2032. Safe to say, digital experiences are here to stay, and as technology advances, they are also evolving with time.', 'While traditional video games limit a player to looking at a screen or using a headset, the metaverse seeks to transport them into the digital realm. While there are several different definitions for a metaverse, the simplest is that it is a 3D environment that allows people to have lifelike, yet digital, experiences. The metaverse caught the public attention during the coronavirus pandemic, as people were forced indoors and had to work and play from home.', ""This growth in consumer interest did not go unnoticed by the finance industry and investors. Data from Crunchbase shows that in 2021, metaverse companies doubled their capital raises to $10 billion. This figure further blossomed in 2022 when $120 billion flew into the sector during the first eight months of the year according to data from the consulting firm McKinsey. And despite the general pessimism in the industry surrounding the technology, McKinsey is also quite optimistic about the metaverse's future as it expects that the sector can generate as much as $5 trillion in value by 2030."", ""Building on the flow of investments in 2022, 2023 has been a busy year for the metaverse. There are few companies right now with the software and computing power to operate such a platform, and one of these is the San Mateo, California based video game developer Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX). Roblox made a splash in November 2023 when it announced its Roblox Connect platform. Through Roblox Connect, Roblox players will be able to call and communicate with their friends in the digital realm. This is a unique service, and the announcement also appears to have a positive impact on the firm's shares that have struggled in 2023. Between January and the end of the first week of November, Roblox's shares lost 16%, but since it announced Roblox Connect, the stock is up by a healthy 17% to mark 6% in year to date gains."", ""Any mention of the metaverse is incomplete without talking about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the only big tech mega cap company that is extremely bullish on the metaverse. Meta's CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has piled in $36 billion into the metaverse, but so far, the money has yielded little results. Nevertheless, its scale does allow it to break in new markets, and Meta's launch of the Quest 3 virtual reality headset in October did stimulate the declining VR market to an extent. However, data from CNBC shows that as of late November, VR headset sales in America dropped to $664 million for a 40% drop. Seems like the metaverse will take some time to catch up with users."", ""Commenting on the Quest and the metaverse, here's what the Meta chief had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:"", 'Now finally, in addition to AI, our other major long-term focus is the metaverse. And we just launched Quest 3, our most powerful headset yet, at a very competitive price.', 'We packed a lot of improvements in there, including a next generation chipset with 2x the graphics performance, our best display as yet, and a form factor that’s 40% thinner than Quest 2. But the most important breakthrough for Quest 3 is that it’s the first mainstream mixed reality device. And that means that when you put on the device, you see your physical room around you, and you can bring digital objects and games into your physical space, whether that’s a ping pong table, your workstation, a big screen TV to play Xbox games on, or your friends as holograms. The early reviews have been great, and it’s been fun to see how people respond to this. We also launched the next generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. They’re upgraded from the first generation in basically every way.', 'Better camera, clearer audio, they’re lighter, they have more styles, and you can now even live stream video from them. But most importantly, these are the first smart glasses shipping with Meta AI built in. So you can ask your glasses questions throughout the day. It’ll answer them right in your ear. And in many ways, glasses are the ideal form factor for an AI device because they enable your AI assistant to see what you see and hear what you hear. Again, it’s good to see the early reviews, they’re so positive, and I’m looking forward to this space evolving quickly over the coming years. We are also making progress on software for the metaverse too. Horizon is now growing faster. There’s more new worlds like Super Rumble and Citadel come online.', ""Today we'll look at some promising metaverse stocks according to hedge funds with the notable picks being Meta Platforms, Inc.

EV adoption is at a tipping point.

In fact, replacing all diesel school buses in the United States with electric school buses would avoid approximately nine million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, the equivalent of removing two million cars from the road. Accelerating deployment represents a significant opportunity for stakeholders, and this report can serve as a guide for public utility commissions, policymakers, and school bus operators to reduce common barriers to adoption and ensure an equitable transition.', 'With the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in effect, there is once-in-a-generation funding to electrify school buses across the nation. Included in this funding is the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Clean School Bus Program, which will allocate a total of $5 billion over a five-year period to accelerate the replacement of diesel school buses with zero- to low-emission models. Nine districts across Exelon’s service areas have been awarded over $40 million in funding to electrify more than 100 buses in the first round of funding. So far, the program has awarded $1 billion to 349 school bus operators in 2022, supporting the replacement of approximately 2,500 school buses.', 'The utility industry is well-positioned to take a leading role in facilitating and accelerating this important market transformation and ensuring the benefits reach customers and communities in an equitable way. As the nation’s largest energy delivery company, Exelon is committed to working with school bus operators, districts, and other community stakeholders to provide recommendations on how to best leverage available resources to maximize benefits for residents of our service areas.', '""School bus electrification has the potential to transform the energy grid by providing stability, capacity and emergency power when needed, but most importantly, this change will transform the lives of the students we serve as well,"" said Sunny Elebua, Exelon\'s Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer. ""At Exelon, we are committed to sustainable progress, particularly in communities where there are marked disparities such as air quality.

Almost 95 percent of school buses, which transport 55 percent of all students, run on diesel. On average, 60 percent of low-income students ride the bus daily, compared to 45 percent of students in other income brackets.

That's why ultra-high-yield dividend stocks like Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), a leading upstream energy company, garner such considerable attention from income investors."", ""But simply buying these stocks to generate strong passive income is hardly a sound investing strategy. It's quite possible that the alluring high yield is masking troubles with the underlying business. In the case of Devon Energy, two Fool.com contributors present both sides of the argument."", ""Scott Levine: Look at Devon Energy's history of dishing out dividends to investors and you'll find that the payout ebbs and flows. This stems from the company's policy of returning both a fixed amount and a variable amount to investors -- a policy that was an industry first when it began in 2021. On top of the fixed amount of $0.20 per share that comprises the dividend each quarter, Devon Energy plans on returning up to 50% of free cash flow."", ""This approach is especially alluring because it illustrates that while the company is returning a hefty amount to investors, management is acting judiciously, working to ensure the company's financial health. By retaining a large portion of its free cash flow, the company is able to reduce its debt and reinvest in the business with acquisitions and improvements in its infrastructure. And it seems to be working, as the company has an investment-grade balance sheet. Further evidence of its financial well-being comes in the form of its conservative approach to leverage. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, Devon Energy had a ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and exploration expenses of 0.7."", ""Devon Energy's stock looks particularly appealing right now from a couple of different perspectives. For one, the stock is valued at 7.6 times trailing earnings, representing a steep discount to its five-year average P/E ratio of 23.9. For those who prefer a cash-flow valuation, shares still seem attractively priced. Currently, shares are valued at 4.3 times operating cash flow -- lower than their five-year average ratio of 5.1."", ""Because its dividend is sensitive to the ebbs and flows in oil prices, income investors should recognize that this income stock won't provide steadily increasing dividends. Nonetheless, investors can certainly look to Devon Energy as a way to diversify their passive income portfolio with a stock that will provide hefty returns when energy prices soar."", 'Lee Samaha: For the record, I agree that Devon Energy is an attractive stock for investors. However, it makes no sense not to explore the bear case before buying a stock, and Devon Energy might not suit all investors.', ""It's no secret that the fortunes of oil and gas exploration and production companies tend to be led by oil prices. That's a fact implied in a slide on Devon's third-quarter earnings presentation outlining its free-cash-flow and dividend sensitivity about the price of oil. There's nothing wrong with this, but it is a fact to consider for investors holding a portfolio overloaded with energy-related stocks."", ""In addition, while investors focus on oil, it's essential to recognize that the collapse in gas prices of the last year played a significant role in the lowering of Devon Energy's dividend through 2023."", ""Moreover, the chart above shows another aspect of Devon's dividend you must consider. While many income-seeking investors are happy to hold it for the dividend and the promise, at the least, of its base dividend of $0.20 (which would yield 1.85% at the current price), the reality is the market has historically traded the stock in line with the price of oil. As such, historical trading does not support the idea that the dividend yield will support the share price."", 'All told Devon Energy is a fine and worthy candidate for investors looking for exposure to energy, but be prepared for some potential share price volatility if you buy it.', ""There's no dividend stock that's perfect for every investor. Those comfortable with the fact that Devon Energy's dividend will dip when oil prices drop, however, may want to drill down deeper into the advantages of counting this exploration and production company among their holdings. On the other hand, investors who are more concerned with generating steady passive income will want to eschew Devon Energy and consider a more reliable company like those that distinguish themselves as Dividend Kings."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

First is your desired annual income of $12,000 or $2,400 and the second is the dividend yield of of the stock — 3.77% in this case. The dividend yield is a percentage calculated by dividing the annual dividend payments by the market price of a stock.', 'To earn $1,000 per month, your investment is about $318,302 ($12,000 / 0.0377) and $63,660 ($2,400 / 0.0377) if you opt for a moderate $200 monthly income.', 'When estimating your investment value, it is important to note that the dividend yield can change over time. This change is because of the fluctuations in stock prices and the dividend payments on a rolling basis. These estimations do not consider the capital appreciation of a stock. If those are not factored into the capital appreciation, the dividend value and the yield are positively correlated.', ""Understanding the yield calculations with an example: Assume a stock paying $2 as an annual dividend is trading at $50. The dividend yield would be $2 / $50 or 4%. When the stock price jumps to $60, the dividend yield drops to $2 / $60 or 3.33%. If the stock price falls to $40, this will trigger an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).

Banks have been working for centuries to manage money and make payments for businesses, and throughout its history, the industry has had to keep up with the times. To understand just how old the finance system is, consider the world's largest private bank in terms of assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JPMorgan traces its history back to the days of the American Revolution, as it was acquired by Chase Manhattan bank in 2000 to become the biggest bank holding company in the U.S. Chase Manhattan itself was initially set up in 1799, making it one of the oldest banks in the world. However, JPMorgan isn't the oldest bank in the world, with one of the oldest financial institutions being Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.\xa0 - a state owned Italian bank that was set up in 1624 and traced its roots back to 1472."", ""The world, if you're unaware, has significantly changed since 1472. Now, banks and financial institutions process thousands of transactions daily and move money thousands of miles across the world. Similarly, companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) have leveraged technology to serve a larger number of people who are covered by the financial system. Banking, like gasoline, is a commodity and the lack of access to a bank account often means that people cannot perform or earn to their full potential. After all, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is unlikely to pay its employees hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in cash, and anyone who cannot open a bank account often misses out on financial opportunities."", ""The intersection of the finance industry and modern day computing technology is dubbed 'fintech'. Short form for financial technology, the fintech sector is simply defined as the use of technology to steal market share away from traditional financial providers when it comes to managing finances for businesses or enabling consumers to spend, save, or earn their money. Naturally, this potential of being able to cater to millions of consumers and businesses means that the right financial technology companies can be quite valuable."", ""As an illustration, consider the consulting firm McKinsey's estimate of the total market value of publicly traded fintech companies as of July 2023. According to the firm, these companies were worth $550 billion, a two fold increase over the four years since 2019. While this figure is quite sizeable on its own, it doesn't represent the full value of the fintech sector since McKinsey adds that fintech unicorns were worth an additional $936 billion for an unbelievable growth from the $1 billion in value just five years back."", 'Yet, just like the broader stock market, the fintech sector is also subject to the whims of the global economy. Venture Capital funding in fintech companies stood at $19.4 billion in 2015 to sit at $33.3 billion in 2020. Just like the coronavirus pandemic saw money flow into technology companies on the back of stronger demand for their products, money also piled into the fintech sector as $92.3 billion was poured into these companies in 2021 as users turned to the digital realm for their financial needs in the wake of lock downs and economic disruption.', 'Similarly, just as other industries are now desperately seeking the integration of artificial intelligence, so is the financial technology industry. So much so that one of the biggest payment platforms and service providers in the world, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently published a report highlighting the ten ways in which GenAI can disrupt the banking and financial sectors.

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to\xa05 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.', ""This year started with fears of recession but as the year moved on, markets rallied thanks to a decline in inflation and the AI boom. Looking ahead, there is optimism about ongoing favorable factors, including continued supply improvements and expectations of declining inflation. The year's positive developments highlight the complexity of economic dynamics and the need for adaptive monetary policies."", ""In December, U.S. homebuilder confidence rebounded, reaching a level of 37 compared to the previous month's 34, as per the National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Index, reported Reuters. The rise suggests that the recent decline in interest rates may be positively impacting sales conditions for builders. This improvement follows a period of falling confidence in November, attributed to the challenges posed by the highest borrowing costs in two decades. The recent drop of approximately 50 basis points in mortgage rates over the past month has led to increased builder optimism. The lower rates are attracting potential buyers who had previously felt priced out of the market, contributing to a rise in overall builder confidence. NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey noted the positive trend, stating that the uptick in traffic reflects the renewed interest of buyers who had been hesitant due to affordability concerns. The decline in confidence in November was influenced by rising mortgage rates, compelling builders to reduce prices since the summer in an effort to enhance affordability. After reaching a two-decade high of 7.9% in October, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 7.07% last week. This shift aligns with signals suggesting that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike cycle may be concluding, with potential rate cuts anticipated in 2024. During the recent surge in interest rates, homeowners locked into lower rates were hesitant to sell, prompting prospective buyers to turn to the new construction market. However, as rates surged through October, buyer traffic declined, reaching a low of 21 in November, the lowest reading since December 2022. In December, prospective buyer traffic increased to 24, indicating a positive shift in market dynamics. Although the share of builders reducing prices remained unchanged at 36% in December, tying with the previous month's high, sales conditions saw notable improvements, particularly in the Midwest and South, where both regions experienced a 4-point increase on a monthly basis. This suggests a regional variation in the impact of changing market conditions on builders."", ""On the Asian side, amid uncertainties in Japan's economy and global financial markets, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy, keeping interest rates at -0.1% and adhering to a 1% upper limit for 10-year government bond yields. According to CNBC, this cautious approach, driven by concerns about the fragile economy, was underscored in a policy statement expressing the BOJ's commitment to patient monetary easing. The yen weakened, and the Nikkei 225 rose 1%, while 10-year bond yields remained mostly unchanged. Speculation on unwinding the policy is deferred, with Governor Kazuo Ueda expected to provide guidance after monitoring economic indicators and awaiting spring wage negotiations. Despite previous expectations, the BOJ remains cautious about prematurely unwinding its ultra-loose policy, fearing potential risks to recent economic improvements. Core inflation is projected to stay above 2% through fiscal 2024, supporting the BOJ's commitment to super-accommodative monetary policy and a preference for domestically driven inflation for sustainability."", 'Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., tech stocks such as Adobe Inc.

(NYSE:PLD) to an Overweight rating from Neutral, concurrently revising the price target upward to $148 from $123. This strategic decision aligns with the firm's comprehensive 2024 REITs and Real Estate Services Outlook, where it is implementing eleven ratings adjustments. The rationale behind the more favorable stance on Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) stems from a nuanced assessment of various factors associated with the company's relative growth trajectory."", ""In the context of JPMorgan's overarching analysis of the real estate landscape, Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) emerges as a particularly promising entity. Mueller's upgraded outlook reflects an optimistic evaluation of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) potential for growth and value appreciation, as underscored by the revised price target of $148. This adjustment is not merely a speculative move but is grounded in a meticulous consideration of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) performance metrics and its strategic positioning within the evolving real estate market. The heightened rating and augmented price target signal JPMorgan's confidence in Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) ability to capitalize on prevailing market dynamics. As part of the broader 2024 REITs and Real Estate Services Outlook, JPMorgan recognizes the pivotal role Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is poised to play in the coming years, attributing its upgraded stance to a combination of factors that collectively contribute to the company's robust growth prospects."", 'Here is what Baron Real Estate Income Fund has to say about Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) in its Q2 2023 investor\xa0letter:', '“The shares of\xa0Prologis, Inc., the world’s largest industrial REIT, declined in the third quarter of 2023 along with most REITs. We are big fans of CEO Hamid Moghadam and Prologis’ management team, and we remain optimistic about the company’s long-term growth outlook.', 'Prologis owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is concentrated in major global trade markets and large population centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Prologis has an unmatched global platform, strong competitive advantages (scale, data, and technology), and attractive embedded growth prospects. The company is the only industrial REIT with an A credit rating.', 'We continue to believe the appreciation potential for Prologis shares remains compelling given that the company’s rents on its in-place leases are more than 65% below current market rents, thus providing a strong runway for growth in the next three to five years.”', 'Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.17\xa0(-0.34%)', 'On December 18, Daiwa Securities analyst Kazuya Nishimura upgraded Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) from a Neutral to a more favorable Buy rating, coupled with a designated price target of $63.00. This upgrade carries implications for the financial industry, as Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a prominent player in the banking and financial services sector. Despite the positive outlook conveyed by the upgrade, the market reaction on the day of the announcement was a modest decline, with a price reaction of -0.17 (-0.34%). This nuanced reaction suggests that while the upgrade is indicative of an optimistic long-term view on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) performance, there may be short-term factors or market sentiments influencing the immediate response.', 'Here is what\xa0Silver Beech Capital\xa0has to say about Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Citigroup\xa0(“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.” (Click here to see the full text)', 'Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.10\xa0(+0.59%)', ""On December 18, Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris made a significant upgrade to Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), shifting the stock's rating from Neutral to Buy and concurrently revising the price target from $9.00 to $23.00. This development is particularly noteworthy within the technology and social media industry, as Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) plays a prominent role in this dynamic sector. The upgraded outlook from Guggenheim reflects a positive anticipation of the digital advertising landscape in 2024. Morris foresees an overall acceleration in digital advertising demand during this period. The cornerstone of Guggenheim's optimistic stance on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) lies in the expectation that the company's revenue growth will outperform market trends.

(NYSE:CRM), elevating the stock's rating from Peerperform to Outperform, and concurrently setting a new price target of $315.00. This development holds significance within the technology and software industry, given Salesforce's prominent position as a leading player in the customer relationship management (CRM) sector. Zukin's upgraded outlook is grounded in Wolfe Research's core thesis that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) growth trajectory has reached a bottom and is poised to remain in the double digits. The analyst also highlights the firm's genuine commitment to margin leverage, suggesting a strategic focus on optimizing profitability. Wolfe Research perceives 2024 as a pivotal year for investors to hold this value growth stock, underlining its confidence in Salesforce, Inc.

Concurrently, the analyst raised the price target from $144 to $176. This development is particularly relevant within the insurance industry, as The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a prominent player in the insurance and financial services sector. The rationale behind the upgrade, as outlined by Wells Fargo, centers on the belief that The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is poised to return to Personal Insurance Fund (PIF) growth in 2024. This key forecast reflects the firm's confidence in The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) ability to navigate market dynamics and capitalize on growth opportunities within the insurance landscape.

Per latest figures, the shares of these three firms are all up this year, by 25%, 55%, and 245% respectively. There is little doubt that these tech firms still have a formidable runway for growth.

Banks have been working for centuries to manage money and make payments for businesses, and throughout its history, the industry has had to keep up with the times. To understand just how old the finance system is, consider the world's largest private bank in terms of assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). JPMorgan traces its history back to the days of the American Revolution, as it was acquired by Chase Manhattan bank in 2000 to become the biggest bank holding company in the U.S. Chase Manhattan itself was initially set up in 1799, making it one of the oldest banks in the world. However, JPMorgan isn't the oldest bank in the world, with one of the oldest financial institutions being Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.\xa0 - a state owned Italian bank that was set up in 1624 and traced its roots back to 1472."", ""The world, if you're unaware, has significantly changed since 1472. Now, banks and financial institutions process thousands of transactions daily and move money thousands of miles across the world. Similarly, companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) have leveraged technology to serve a larger number of people who are covered by the financial system. Banking, like gasoline, is a commodity and the lack of access to a bank account often means that people cannot perform or earn to their full potential. After all, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is unlikely to pay its employees hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in cash, and anyone who cannot open a bank account often misses out on financial opportunities."", ""The intersection of the finance industry and modern day computing technology is dubbed 'fintech'. Short form for financial technology, the fintech sector is simply defined as the use of technology to steal market share away from traditional financial providers when it comes to managing finances for businesses or enabling consumers to spend, save, or earn their money. Naturally, this potential of being able to cater to millions of consumers and businesses means that the right financial technology companies can be quite valuable."", ""As an illustration, consider the consulting firm McKinsey's estimate of the total market value of publicly traded fintech companies as of July 2023. According to the firm, these companies were worth $550 billion, a two fold increase over the four years since 2019. While this figure is quite sizeable on its own, it doesn't represent the full value of the fintech sector since McKinsey adds that fintech unicorns were worth an additional $936 billion for an unbelievable growth from the $1 billion in value just five years back."", 'Yet, just like the broader stock market, the fintech sector is also subject to the whims of the global economy. Venture Capital funding in fintech companies stood at $19.4 billion in 2015 to sit at $33.3 billion in 2020. Just like the coronavirus pandemic saw money flow into technology companies on the back of stronger demand for their products, money also piled into the fintech sector as $92.3 billion was poured into these companies in 2021 as users turned to the digital realm for their financial needs in the wake of lock downs and economic disruption.', 'Similarly, just as other industries are now desperately seeking the integration of artificial intelligence, so is the financial technology industry.

The jets also offer increased comfort and relaxation for passengers, with modern technologies, greater space and larger pivoting overhead storage bins.Such remarkable features must have bolstered demand for this jet family over the past few years. Coming to the recent achievements, in December 2023, Boeing received an order for 40 737-8 airplanes from Avolon, and in November 2023, BA received orders for 20 737-8 from Ethiopian Airlines and seven 737-8 from SCAT Airlines.Revenues earned from these deliveries, including the latest deal for 40 jets, will significantly bolster Boeing’s commercial unit’s top line, which witnessed a solid 25% year-over-year improvement in the last reported quarter.', 'As we continue to witness a steady recovery in the aviation industry over the past few months, the European region has seen an upward growth trend.

After all, several risk-on asset classes, including technology-focused securities and cryptocurrencies have soared over the past several weeks. However, not all may be well with the equities space, presenting relevance for the staid but reliable investments.', 'Primarily, a risk-on pivot materialized due to speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sometime next year. While anything’s possible, the robust jobs market presents a surprise headwind. Generally, monetary policymakers deploy interest rate cuts during deflationary cycles, not when the labor market is running at full speed. Therefore, utility stocks with dividends make sense.', 'No matter what happens – whether we continue on this bull run or if a black swan event changes everything – people need access to energy and critical resources. In other words, we all must pay the bills. That’s the underlying cynicism bolstering dividend-paying utilities stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Plus, no one’s saying not to speculate. But it’s good to have a parachute, just in case. Below are dividend stocks to consider.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is a powerhouse among utility stocks with dividends. By covering large portions of the Southern California market, Sempra effectively guarantees itself relevance. Sure, investors must watch out for migration trends and all that jazz. However, as a coastal region with ports to the Pacific Ocean and an international border with Mexico, Sempra is in a prime location.', 'Relevance: Right now, the company carries a forward dividend yield of 3.22%. To be fair, that’s a bit lower than the sector average of 3.75%. However, Sempra enjoys 20 years of consecutive payout increases. That’s a status that management will want to hold onto. Further, the payout ratio sits at just under 50%, which is reasonable considering the consistency inherent in dividend-paying utilities stocks.', 'Pros: Analysts appreciate the opportunity, rating Sempra shares a consensus moderate buy. Also, while the average price target is modest at $80.30, the implied 9% upside is decent for a utility.', 'Cons: While it’s boring, that doesn’t always translate to positive performances. So far, SRE is down about 4% year-to-date, which is kinda disappointing for dividend stocks.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated electric utility and natural gas delivery firm. Per its public profile, the company serves more than 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across parts of eight states. With a concentration in the Midwest and western regions of the nation, Xcel benefits from migration trends. More young people are moving to the Midwest for cost-of-living reasons.', 'Relevance: Presently, Xcel offers a forward yield of 3.4%. Again, it’s a bit lower than average dividend stocks in the utilities space. However, Xcel also features 20 years of consecutive payout increases, something that its leadership team will want to keep going as a strong selling point to investors. Further, its payout ratio comes in at 58.14%, which is decent for the predictable utilities space.', 'Pros: Analysts view XEL as a consensus moderate buy. On a fundamental level, Xcel should see increased demand as more people move to areas the utility covers. And because utilities command the natural monopoly tailwind, XEL is a name to watch for the long run.', 'Cons: If you’re looking for big capital gains, XEL isn’t it. Its average price target of $63.64 implies only 4% upside from the time of writing.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Topeka, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, Evergy (NASDAQ:EVRG) is a prime example of investor-owned dividend-paying utility stocks. According to its public profile, Evergy is the largest electric company in Kansas, serving more than 1.7 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Kansas and Missouri. Fundamentally, the company benefits from millennial migration as they seek refuge from the high costs of living in major metropolitan areas.', 'Relevance: One of the most intriguing dividend stocks if you’re focused on the utilities space, Evergy commands a forward yield of 5%. That’s conspicuously above average for the sector. However, you must be prepared to absorb a higher-risk profile given the elevated payout ratio of 67%. Also, the utility lacks an ongoing consecutive track record of rising payouts.', 'Pros: Again, the millennial migration aspect warrants consideration for Evergy. To sweeten the pot, shares trade at forward earnings multiple of 13.27x, lower than the sector median of 14.66x.', 'Cons: At the moment, analysts rate EVRG only as a consensus hold. Also, the average price target of $52.20 implies a measly upside potential of less than 2%.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) which saw its share price drive 132% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 11% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days)."", ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials ', 'In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""During five years of share price growth, Vulcan Materials achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.9% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth."", 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""We know that Vulcan Materials has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Vulcan Materials' TSR for the last 5 years was 143%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""It's nice to see that Vulcan Materials shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 19% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Vulcan Materials   you should know about."", 'If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to\xa05 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.', ""This year started with fears of recession but as the year moved on, markets rallied thanks to a decline in inflation and the AI boom. Looking ahead, there is optimism about ongoing favorable factors, including continued supply improvements and expectations of declining inflation. The year's positive developments highlight the complexity of economic dynamics and the need for adaptive monetary policies."", ""In December, U.S. homebuilder confidence rebounded, reaching a level of 37 compared to the previous month's 34, as per the National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Index, reported Reuters. The rise suggests that the recent decline in interest rates may be positively impacting sales conditions for builders. This improvement follows a period of falling confidence in November, attributed to the challenges posed by the highest borrowing costs in two decades. The recent drop of approximately 50 basis points in mortgage rates over the past month has led to increased builder optimism. The lower rates are attracting potential buyers who had previously felt priced out of the market, contributing to a rise in overall builder confidence. NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey noted the positive trend, stating that the uptick in traffic reflects the renewed interest of buyers who had been hesitant due to affordability concerns. The decline in confidence in November was influenced by rising mortgage rates, compelling builders to reduce prices since the summer in an effort to enhance affordability. After reaching a two-decade high of 7.9% in October, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 7.07% last week. This shift aligns with signals suggesting that the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike cycle may be concluding, with potential rate cuts anticipated in 2024. During the recent surge in interest rates, homeowners locked into lower rates were hesitant to sell, prompting prospective buyers to turn to the new construction market. However, as rates surged through October, buyer traffic declined, reaching a low of 21 in November, the lowest reading since December 2022. In December, prospective buyer traffic increased to 24, indicating a positive shift in market dynamics. Although the share of builders reducing prices remained unchanged at 36% in December, tying with the previous month's high, sales conditions saw notable improvements, particularly in the Midwest and South, where both regions experienced a 4-point increase on a monthly basis. This suggests a regional variation in the impact of changing market conditions on builders."", ""On the Asian side, amid uncertainties in Japan's economy and global financial markets, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy, keeping interest rates at -0.1% and adhering to a 1% upper limit for 10-year government bond yields. According to CNBC, this cautious approach, driven by concerns about the fragile economy, was underscored in a policy statement expressing the BOJ's commitment to patient monetary easing. The yen weakened, and the Nikkei 225 rose 1%, while 10-year bond yields remained mostly unchanged. Speculation on unwinding the policy is deferred, with Governor Kazuo Ueda expected to provide guidance after monitoring economic indicators and awaiting spring wage negotiations. Despite previous expectations, the BOJ remains cautious about prematurely unwinding its ultra-loose policy, fearing potential risks to recent economic improvements. Core inflation is projected to stay above 2% through fiscal 2024, supporting the BOJ's commitment to super-accommodative monetary policy and a preference for domestically driven inflation for sustainability."", 'Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., tech stocks such as Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX)\xa0are receiving a massive vote of approval from Wall Street analysts. Check out the complete article to see the details of these and other stocks.', 'Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -1.58\xa0(-1.18%)', ""On December 18, JPMorgan analyst Michael Mueller elevated Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) to an Overweight rating from Neutral, concurrently revising the price target upward to $148 from $123. This strategic decision aligns with the firm's comprehensive 2024 REITs and Real Estate Services Outlook, where it is implementing eleven ratings adjustments. The rationale behind the more favorable stance on Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) stems from a nuanced assessment of various factors associated with the company's relative growth trajectory."", ""In the context of JPMorgan's overarching analysis of the real estate landscape, Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) emerges as a particularly promising entity. Mueller's upgraded outlook reflects an optimistic evaluation of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) potential for growth and value appreciation, as underscored by the revised price target of $148. This adjustment is not merely a speculative move but is grounded in a meticulous consideration of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) performance metrics and its strategic positioning within the evolving real estate market. The heightened rating and augmented price target signal JPMorgan's confidence in Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) ability to capitalize on prevailing market dynamics. As part of the broader 2024 REITs and Real Estate Services Outlook, JPMorgan recognizes the pivotal role Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is poised to play in the coming years, attributing its upgraded stance to a combination of factors that collectively contribute to the company's robust growth prospects."", 'Here is what Baron Real Estate Income Fund has to say about Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) in its Q2 2023 investor\xa0letter:', '“The shares of\xa0Prologis, Inc., the world’s largest industrial REIT, declined in the third quarter of 2023 along with most REITs. We are big fans of CEO Hamid Moghadam and Prologis’ management team, and we remain optimistic about the company’s long-term growth outlook.', 'Prologis owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is concentrated in major global trade markets and large population centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Prologis has an unmatched global platform, strong competitive advantages (scale, data, and technology), and attractive embedded growth prospects. The company is the only industrial REIT with an A credit rating.', 'We continue to believe the appreciation potential for Prologis shares remains compelling given that the company’s rents on its in-place leases are more than 65% below current market rents, thus providing a strong runway for growth in the next three to five years.”', 'Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.17\xa0(-0.34%)', 'On December 18, Daiwa Securities analyst Kazuya Nishimura upgraded Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) from a Neutral to a more favorable Buy rating, coupled with a designated price target of $63.00. This upgrade carries implications for the financial industry, as Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a prominent player in the banking and financial services sector. Despite the positive outlook conveyed by the upgrade, the market reaction on the day of the announcement was a modest decline, with a price reaction of -0.17 (-0.34%). This nuanced reaction suggests that while the upgrade is indicative of an optimistic long-term view on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) performance, there may be short-term factors or market sentiments influencing the immediate response.', 'Here is what\xa0Silver Beech Capital\xa0has to say about Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Citigroup\xa0(“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.” (Click here to see the full text)', 'Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.10\xa0(+0.59%)', ""On December 18, Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris made a significant upgrade to Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), shifting the stock's rating from Neutral to Buy and concurrently revising the price target from $9.00 to $23.00. This development is particularly noteworthy within the technology and social media industry, as Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) plays a prominent role in this dynamic sector. The upgraded outlook from Guggenheim reflects a positive anticipation of the digital advertising landscape in 2024. Morris foresees an overall acceleration in digital advertising demand during this period. The cornerstone of Guggenheim's optimistic stance on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) lies in the expectation that the company's revenue growth will outperform market trends. This outperformance is anticipated to be driven by the surge in demand leading to industry-wide ad price increases, ultimately contributing to improved relative returns for Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) advertising units."", ""The assigned price target of $23.00 provides investors with a specific marker, indicating the analyst's forecast for the stock's potential value.

(NYSE:CRM), elevating the stock's rating from Peerperform to Outperform, and concurrently setting a new price target of $315.00. This development holds significance within the technology and software industry, given Salesforce's prominent position as a leading player in the customer relationship management (CRM) sector. Zukin's upgraded outlook is grounded in Wolfe Research's core thesis that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) growth trajectory has reached a bottom and is poised to remain in the double digits. The analyst also highlights the firm's genuine commitment to margin leverage, suggesting a strategic focus on optimizing profitability. Wolfe Research perceives 2024 as a pivotal year for investors to hold this value growth stock, underlining its confidence in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) potential for robust performance in the upcoming years."", ""The assigned price target of $315.00 provides investors with a specific benchmark, offering insight into the analyst's expectations for the stock's future valuation. The positive price reaction after the upgrade, indicated by a 1.99 (0.76%) increase, reflects the market's favorable response to Wolfe Research's optimistic assessment of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) growth prospects and commitment to margin improvement."", 'Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +2.59\xa0(+1.69%)', ""On December 18, Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan made a noteworthy upgrade for The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), shifting the stock's rating from Equal Weight to a more optimistic Overweight. Concurrently, the analyst raised the price target from $144 to $176. This development is particularly relevant within the insurance industry, as The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a prominent player in the insurance and financial services sector. The rationale behind the upgrade, as outlined by Wells Fargo, centers on the belief that The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is poised to return to Personal Insurance Fund (PIF) growth in 2024. This key forecast reflects the firm's confidence in The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) ability to navigate market dynamics and capitalize on growth opportunities within the insurance landscape.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Analysts. ', ""The primary reason most folks are attracted to the stock market is growth. If bets are timed right, then investment can double or even triple in value over a short period of time depending on the market conditions. This phenomenon is so integral to the stock market that we don't even have to look too far back in its history to see its illustration. This is because 2023 has been the year of artificial intelligence when it comes to stocks. San Francisco, California based OpenAI took the world by storm this year when it first introduced ChatGPT - the world's first chat bot based on generative AI - and then followed up GPT-4, one of the most advanced A.I. models on the planet."", ""This created a feverish stock buying frenzy that saw investors flock to A.I. companies to profit from their shares. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the rush to A.I. was the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA designs graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are essential to training and operating advanced A.I. models. So how does NVIDIA tie into our narrative of the stock market being one of the biggest deliverers of investment growth? Well, NVIDIA's potential to dominate the global A.I. conversation has led its shares to gain a whopping 249% year to date. What this means is that if you have invested $1,000 into its shares at the start of this year, then your investment would be worth $3,490 right now, leaving you with more than three times what you had in January."", ""While NVIDIA is one of the biggest growth stories of this year, as a whole, investors have some tools up their sleeves when it comes to classifying growth stocks. One of these is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. A P/E ratio evaluates the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's shares over its earnings. Generally, the higher the P/E ratio is w.r.t the industry multiple, the stronger the 'growth sentiment' about a company is. This is because investors are 'pricing in' future earnings growth through the share price by paying a higher price now with the hope that earnings will increase in the future."", ""However, growth is not an absolute principle for the stock market. The market's ability to deliver principal growth is quite dependent on the broader economic environment. Once again, since 2022 and 2023 have been some of the most historic years for the market, we don't have to look too far back to see how this works. 2022 was marked by record high inflation fueled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the low interest rates during the pandemic era. To bring inflation down, the Federal Reserve aggressively jacked up interest rates, which isn't great for either the market or growth stocks. Higher interest rates mean that money flows into high rate securities since they are essentially risk free. This made the stock market lose, and for growth stocks, this was compounded by inflation. Inflation isn't great for growth stocks, and not only for their market performance. Higher inflation means firms can not comfortably invest in the future, the demand for their products drops, and they have to tighten their belts to maintain stability."", 'Yet, with 2023 coming to an end, the tides of the stock market appear to be shifting. This is because there is a growing consensus among investors that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking rates, making them adjust their investments accordingly. This made us think about making a list of the top growth stocks that analysts believe are promising. Within this list, some top picks are Alphabet Inc.

They also welcomed digitization with open arms and made investments in technology to include telehealth services.However, the announcement made by a UnitedHealth Group UNH official this June about the resumption of elective procedures acted as a headwind to the price performance of health insurers in the first half of 2023. Soon after the announcement, shares of major health insurers like UNH, Humana Inc.

That\'s because of the popular investing strategy called ""the Dogs of the Dow,"" which focuses on buying the 10 Dow Jones Industrial Average components that have the highest yields. Because share prices and dividend yields generally move in opposite directions (absent a large change to a company\'s payout), the blue-chip stocks with the highest yields will likely have performed poorly in the past calendar year and could be trading at attractive valuations.', 'But we don\'t have to wait until the official end of 2023 to search for values in the Dow, whether they count as ""dogs"" or not. We can already see some good reasons to buy Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Nike (NYSE: NKE) for 2024 and beyond. Let\'s find out a bit more about these three beaten-down Dow stocks.', ""Procter & Gamble's 5% year-to-date stock price decline through mid-December was weak enough to make it the seventh-worst-performing stock on the Dow in 2023. That's as compared to the index's 12% rally over the same time."", ""That sell-off was not enough to earn P&G a spot on the Dogs of the Dow list -- its yield is just 2.6%. However, it still seems overdone given the consumer staples giant's strong operating and financial momentum. Organic sales were up 7% in its fiscal 2024 Q1 (which ended Sept. 30), putting P&G on track to hit the high end of management's fiscal year growth outlook. Revenue should rise by about 5% this fiscal year after expanding by 7% in fiscal 2023."", ""On the downside, P&G is struggling to boost organic sales volumes, and so it has had to rely entirely on rising prices to boost overall revenue. Yet a return to growth on this metric, along with the stock's 2.6% dividend yield, would power solid returns from here for patient investors."", ""Coke's stock slump in 2023 just doesn't make sense. The beverage titan is winning market share, boosting sales, and generating sparkling profits. Yet the stock has dropped 7% through mid-December, making it the fifth-worst performer on the index."", ""Investors shouldn't waste time trying to find a good reason for Coke's share price decline, but instead should consider capitalizing on it. You can own this Dividend King for less than 6 times annual sales, down from a 2023 high valuation of closer to 7 times sales. Coke has only been valued this cheaply a handful of times over the past decade."", ""The stock's yield at its current share price is over 3% today, putting Coke in the top 10 on the Dow by that metric. There are plenty of resources behind that dividend payment. Coke's profit margin is a blazing 30% of sales or roughly double Pepsico's rate."", ""Nike's position in the footwear industry has made it an unpopular choice among investors in 2023. Shares have gained just 4% this year, which makes it the 12th worst performer on the index. That weak outing makes sense because its retail niche has been shrinking and is becoming more price-competitive. Retailers like Foot Locker have seen their profit margins dive due to aggressive price cuts by rivals."", ""Yet Nike's exposure to this problem is limited. It has done a great job slashing inventory in recent quarters, easing pricing pressure on the business. And Nike's focus on innovation provides another lift. Pre-tax earnings last quarter slipped only slightly, falling to 13% from 15% in the prior-year period."", 'Investors can find faster-growing, more profitable stocks in this niche.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Analysts. ', ""The primary reason most folks are attracted to the stock market is growth. If bets are timed right, then investment can double or even triple in value over a short period of time depending on the market conditions. This phenomenon is so integral to the stock market that we don't even have to look too far back in its history to see its illustration. This is because 2023 has been the year of artificial intelligence when it comes to stocks. San Francisco, California based OpenAI took the world by storm this year when it first introduced ChatGPT - the world's first chat bot based on generative AI - and then followed up GPT-4, one of the most advanced A.I. models on the planet."", ""This created a feverish stock buying frenzy that saw investors flock to A.I. companies to profit from their shares. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the rush to A.I. was the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA designs graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are essential to training and operating advanced A.I. models. So how does NVIDIA tie into our narrative of the stock market being one of the biggest deliverers of investment growth? Well, NVIDIA's potential to dominate the global A.I. conversation has led its shares to gain a whopping 249% year to date. What this means is that if you have invested $1,000 into its shares at the start of this year, then your investment would be worth $3,490 right now, leaving you with more than three times what you had in January."", ""While NVIDIA is one of the biggest growth stories of this year, as a whole, investors have some tools up their sleeves when it comes to classifying growth stocks. One of these is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. A P/E ratio evaluates the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's shares over its earnings. Generally, the higher the P/E ratio is w.r.t the industry multiple, the stronger the 'growth sentiment' about a company is. This is because investors are 'pricing in' future earnings growth through the share price by paying a higher price now with the hope that earnings will increase in the future."", ""However, growth is not an absolute principle for the stock market. The market's ability to deliver principal growth is quite dependent on the broader economic environment. Once again, since 2022 and 2023 have been some of the most historic years for the market, we don't have to look too far back to see how this works. 2022 was marked by record high inflation fueled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the low interest rates during the pandemic era. To bring inflation down, the Federal Reserve aggressively jacked up interest rates, which isn't great for either the market or growth stocks. Higher interest rates mean that money flows into high rate securities since they are essentially risk free. This made the stock market lose, and for growth stocks, this was compounded by inflation. Inflation isn't great for growth stocks, and not only for their market performance. Higher inflation means firms can not comfortably invest in the future, the demand for their products drops, and they have to tighten their belts to maintain stability."", 'Yet, with 2023 coming to an end, the tides of the stock market appear to be shifting. This is because there is a growing consensus among investors that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking rates, making them adjust their investments accordingly. This made us think about making a list of the top growth stocks that analysts believe are promising. Within this list, some top picks are Alphabet Inc.

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) share price is up 92% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. But if you include dividends then the return is market-beating. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 18% in the last year."", ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' View our latest analysis for Aflac ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price."", ""During five years of share price growth, Aflac achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.1% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 14% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth."", 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""Dive deeper into Aflac's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Aflac's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", 'It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Aflac the TSR over the last 5 years was 117%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', ""Aflac shareholders gained a total return of 21% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 17% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Aflac (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

After all, the U.S. jobs market continues to print impressive figures that beat analysts’ estimates. Still, as a Forbes article pointed out, despite a strong jobs print, recession concerns still exist.', 'As CNBC explained, a divergence now exists between falling oil prices, rising gold prices and a boost in the 10-Year Treasury yield. The former two events indicate that a recession may impact the U.S. economy. However, the latter indicator implies hopes for a soft landing. In other words, the ambiguity presents a case for property investment opportunities.', 'Thanks to their distinct structure, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. Further, these enterprises tend to align themselves with industries benefitting from predictable demand streams. Therefore, if you don’t know what may happen next, income-generating real estate makes plenty of sense.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Recession or not, it’s always nice to have passive income to mitigate against any uncertainties. With that, below are reliable REITs to consider.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: One of the top reliable REITs available, Prologis (NYSE:PLD) invests in logistics facilities. According to the company’s Form 10-K, Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. Further, its footprint covers 19 countries across four continents. At the moment, the company carries a market capitalization of $112.7 billion.', 'Relevance: Because of Prologis’ focus on high-barrier markets, it may benefit from economic insulation. Put another way, a hefty commitment exists among the REIT’s tenants, making turnover less likely. Sure enough, one of the strong points in the enterprise’s financials is consistent profitability over the past 10 years. It also posts a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 13.1%.', 'Pros: Right now, Prologis offers a forward yield of 2.85%. While that’s a bit lower than other property investment opportunities, the track record of consecutive dividend increases stands at 10 years.', 'Cons: As with other income-generating real estate plays, the focus is on income rather than capital gains.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Focused on the wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure field, American Tower (NYSE:AMT) features a massive footprint. According to its website, the company commands 225,000 global sites. Further, it covers 25 countries across six continents while employing around 6,000 workers. It’s also a large enterprise, featuring a market cap of nearly $96 billion, making it a comfortable prospect for reliable REITs.', 'Relevance: Unless you envision a world where telecommunications and wireless initiatives will regress, American Tower should be relevant. According to Precedence Research, the global wireless infrastructure market reached a valuation of just over $160 billion last year. By 2032, experts project that the sector could hit a valuation of nearly $387 billion. Just by downwind benefits, AMT ranks among the top property investment opportunities.', 'Pros: Combined with a growing underlying industry, AMT offers a forward dividend yield of 3.15%. As well, the company enjoys 12 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it an overall attractive idea for income-generating real estate.', 'Cons: While AMT rates as a strong buy, upside potential is limited based on the $217.83 average price target.', 'Source: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Stag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) is one of the reliable REITs focused mainly on the e-commerce revolution. Per its website, the REIT targets acquisitions and operation of industrial properties throughout the U.S. These largely involve e-commerce and logistics properties, thus benefitting from a pertinent growth market.', 'Relevance: Back in the second quarter of 2020, e-commerce sales represented 16.5% of all retail transactions. Of course, that stemmed from the surge in retail revenge (basically retail therapy). However, the blistering demand faded as society acclimated to the Covid-19 crisis. However, this metric is back on the rise, hitting 15.6% as of Q3 2023. Indirectly, the upswing makes STAG an intriguing idea for property investment opportunities.', 'Pros: True to this theme, Stag provides a forward yield of 4.05%. Now, the payout ratio is a bit high at 183.71% even for a REIT. Nevertheless, the continued rise of e-commerce should steadily boost STAG.', 'Cons: With STAG having performed relatively well this year, the upside potential inherent in the analysts’ consensus target of $38.25 is limited.', 'Source: mTaira / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Rockville, Maryland, Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is one of the reliable REITs investing in shopping centers in the northeastern region of the U.S. As well, Federal Realty covers the Mid-Atlantic states along with California and South Florida. Fundamentally, it enjoys a mixed geographic footprint that may enable it to benefit from millennial migration trends.', 'Relevance: As stated earlier, the geographic footprint should be a tailwind for Federal Realty. Per its website, its California-focused properties cover Silicon Valley and Southern California. These represent major components of the economic engine that is the Golden State. In addition, its properties in Phoenix, Arizona should add relevance to FRT as younger people move for cost-of-living reasons.', 'Pros: An attractive idea for property investment opportunities, FRT carries a forward yield of 4.39%. Also, it commands 56 years of consecutive dividend increases. There’s no way that management will want to give up this lofty status.', 'Cons: While enticing, Federal Realty lacks diverse property holdings compared to other income-generating real estate.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Hailing from Farmington Hills, Michigan, Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) focuses on neighborhood shopping centers with strong anchor tenants. Though the Covid-19 crisis negatively impacted such businesses during the initial wave, society has mostly normalized. Therefore, Agree might benefit from the acclimatization along with the everyday predictable demand profile that such properties exhibit.', 'Relevance: Again, Agree comes down to serving everyday needs, which makes ADC a solid candidate for reliable REITs. Looking at its financials, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 6.1%, beating out nearly 73% of its peers. Also, Agree unsurprisingly enjoys consistent profitability over the trailing decade. Unless you envision a future where physical shopping becomes obsolete, Agree should be considered one of the top property investment opportunities.', 'Pros: Right now, the REIT offers a forward dividend yield of 5%. That’s noticeably above the sector average yield of 4.46%. Also, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $64.53 average price target.', 'Cons: As with Federal Realty, Agree isn’t quite as diverse as other REITs. Therefore, exposure to consumer sentiment exists.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'What it is: One of the more riskier ideas for reliable REITs, NNN REIT (NYSE:NNN) will require patience. Per its public profile, the entity primarily invests in high-quality properties that are subject to long-term triple-net (NNN) leases. According to Investopedia, this is a type of lease agreement on a property “whereby the tenant or lessee promises to pay all the expenses of the property, including real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance.”', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, the advantage for investors of targeting NNN stock centers on the underlying long-term leases. In addition, market participants may benefit from a diversified tenant base, possibly providing economic insulation. Regarding the financials, National Retail gets the job done with a 2.4% three-year revenue growth rate. However, the real star centers on robust margins and consistent profitability.', 'Pros: If you’re looking for high yields, you’ve come to the right place. NNN carries a forward yield of 5.57%. In addition, the REIT commands 34 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'Cons: If you’re looking for high capital gains potential, you’ve come to the wrong place. NNN is a consensus hold with a measly $41.79 average analyst price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'What it is: Another compelling but risky idea for reliable REITs, Realty Income (NYSE:O) is looking at a year-to-date loss of almost 15%. For conservative investors seeking primarily passive income, that might not cut it. However, Realty focuses on free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties tied to largely to critical businesses such as grocery stores.', 'Relevance: Frankly, the brands that do business with Realty Income speak inherently to the relevance of the enterprise. Unless you envision a future where humans no longer buy groceries, Realty should perform well over the long run. Also, discount retailers do business with the REIT, meaning that there could be added relevance due to the challenging environment.', 'Pros: When it comes to reasons for buying O stock, Realty carries two advantages. First, the company offers a robust forward yield of 5.65%, noticeably above the sector average of 4.46%. Second, it pays this passive income on a monthly basis instead of the typical quarterly basis.', 'Cons: Besides the market volatility, the consensus moderate buy rating is a bit lackluster. We’re talking four buys and six holds, which doesn’t scream confidence.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on American Water Works AWK, CenterPoint Energy (CNP) and Granite Construction (GVA).', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Amazon’s rebound kicked back into high gear following its big beat and raise third quarter at the end of October, with AMZN shares up roughly 85% in 2023.', 'The e-commerce and cloud computing giant’s comeback has been powered by its commitment to boosting earnings and transforming into a mature tech firm that posts impressive top-line growth and massive, constantly expanding profits.', 'Some investors might be worried they ‘missed out’ on Amazon’s rally and could be afraid about what’s next for the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks. There could be some selling and choppiness in the near term for the market and big tech following the huge rally to end a strong year.', 'Yet, Amazon trades solidly below its all-time highs and its average Zacks price target, and its valuation levels have improved as it focuses on the bottom line. Amazon’s various businesses are also more entrenched in the economy than ever.', 'Slowing cloud growth and higher rates hit Amazon stock hard in 2022—alongside most of the technology sector. Thankfully, rates are coming down and AMZN is focused on profits and maximum efficiency under CEO Andy Jassy.', 'Better yet, Amazon still runs the world’s largest cloud-computing business. Cloud computing is a key pillar of the modern economy and is growing in importance.', 'The combination of steady cloud computing growth and a concentrated effort on boosting earnings now and forever is the pitch that breathed fresh life into Amazon stock in 2023 and likely will for years to come.', 'AWS sales climbed 12% in the third quarter, accounting for around 16% of total company revenue. The high-margin segment is eclipsed by its far-large e-commerce unit in terms of overall sales. Yet AWS accounted for over 60% of Amazon’s operating income last quarter and is poised to remain Amazon’s profit hub going forward. Amazon reportedly held 32% of the cloud computing market last quarter vs. Microsoft’s 22% and Google’s 11%.', ""Amazon is attempting to improve AWS margins by rolling out more in-house chips. Amazon is actively introducing AI-focused efforts to attract customers to spend more as everyone races not to get left behind on tech's new frontier. On top of that, Amazon is expanding its collaboration with Nvidia for cutting-edge chips."", 'On the e-commerce front, Amazon is benefiting from its transition from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to eight distinct regions. Amazon currently holds nearly 40% of the total e-commerce market share in the U.S., blowing away second-place Walmart’s 7%. The company is also growing its digital advertising segment. The unit climbed 25% in Q3, marking the largest YoY gain on a percentage basis.', 'Amazon is also aiming to boost its Prime segment by rolling out more live streaming entertainment efforts. For example, new reports say Amazon is in talks to invest in regional sports standout Diamond Sports Group.', 'Current Zacks estimates call for Amazon to post 11% revenue growth in 2023 to pull in $570.75 billion and then climb 12% higher next year to reach $637.05 billion. This would see the firm add a projected $124 billion to the top line between FY22 and FY24, which is more than retail and e-commerce firm Target made in FY22 ($109 billion). These figures mark improved expansion from its 9% revenue growth last year.', 'Amazon’s earnings guidance keeps getting better. AMZN’s consensus fourth quarter EPS estimate has jumped by 15% since its Q3 report, with its FY23 estimate 20% higher and 13% better for FY24.', 'Amazon is projected to post 276% earnings growth in 2023, climbing from $0.71 to $2.67 a share. AMZN is then expected to boost its earnings by another 32% next year to reach $3.53 per share.', 'On top of that, its most accurate/most recent estimates for FY23 and FY24 came in above consensus. Amazon’s overall improved earnings outlook helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. The recent positivity is part of a prolonged stretch of surging earnings outlooks that began in early 2023.', 'Amazon stock has climbed 665% in the last decade to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 250%. Despite this run, Amazon is down 4% in the last three years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 22% climb.', 'AMZN has surged 84% in 2023 to top Microsoft’s 55% and Apple’s 51%. Unlike Apple, MSFT, and Nvidia, Amazon hasn’t posted new all-time highs in 2023. Amazon currently trades around 17% below its all-time highs and its average Zacks price target marks 16% upside to Monday’s levels.', 'Amazon hit new 52-week highs on Monday, having found support at its 21-day moving average recently. AMZN shares have also retaken their very long-term 50-week moving average.', 'On the valuation front, Amazon trades over 65% below its highs and at a 45% discount to its 10-year median at 42.8X forward 12-month earnings. This is still clearly very ‘pricey’ for many investors. But there are signs that Amazon’s forward earnings multiple will keep coming down.', 'Amazon’s PEG ratio, which factors in its earnings growth outlook, marks a 25% discount vs. the Zacks tech sector at 1.5. Better still, Amazon’s PEG ratio sits near its lows over the last 10 years.', 'Amazon is a powerhouse in multiple key areas of the economy that aren’t going out of style. Therefore, investors might want to buy Amazon as a straightforward investment into mega-cap technology and its growing sway over our lives and the market.', 'RH, once known as Restoration Hardware, posted a surprise quarterly loss on December 7 and provided downbeat guidance.', 'The high-end home furniture retailer pointed to higher mortgage rates and other headwinds as reasons for RH’s rough near-term outlook.', 'RH is a luxury-centered furniture and home décor powerhouse that has thrived in a changing retail landscape by keeping it old-school. The company still sends out massive catalogs and it has opened large, high-end stores, many with accompanying bars and restaurants in cities from Chicago to New York.', 'RH is even slowly attempting to push its way into the world of hotels, homes, architecture, and more. RH grew its revenue at a rather impressive rate between its 2012 IPO and 2021, including blowout results in FY21, driven by the booming housing market.', 'RH’s revenue then slipped about 4.5% last year as the housing market cooled and consumers focused on experiences after they spent a prolonged period buying tables, couches, and more.', 'RH’s third quarter FY23 revenue fell by nearly 14%. The company’s adjusted operating margin also came in below expectations “due to higher than anticipated expenses, including international openings as well as costs related to our pending acquisition of the New York Guesthouse property and unsuccessful efforts to secure the iconic One Ocean Drive Miami Beach location.”', 'RH posted an adjusted loss of -$0.42 per share in Q3 vs. our +$0.91 a share Zacks estimate. The firm’s downbeat earnings guidance has seen its consensus estimate slide by 36% for the fourth quarter and 18% for both FY23 and FY24.', 'RH’s most accurate EPS estimates came in below consensus. All of RH’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. The nearby chart shows that RH’s earnings outlook has been fading for well over a year now.', 'RH’s adjusted earnings are expected to slide by 60% YoY on 15% lower revenue. RH’s downbeat outlook is due in part to the slowing housing market. The company also said that the “home furnishings market has become increasingly promotional, and we believe that will create a mix shift towards clearance products, pressuring gross margins.”', 'RH shares are trading over 55% below their peaks. The stock also currently trades under its 200-week moving average.', 'RH is rather heavily shorted at about 17% of the float. All in, it might be best to avoid RH stock for now and look for other firms not tied directly to the housing market or big-ticket retail items.', 'As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady in its latest policy meeting and signaled multiple rate cuts are coming in 2024, with more to be followed in 2025.', 'Utility and real estate players cheer the Fed’s dovish stance as they stand to benefit from the central bank’s motive to lower the policy rate soon.Thus, astute investors should invest in stocks such as American Water Works, CenterPoint Energy and Granite Construction as of now for solid returns.', 'The Fed has held interest rates unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5% for the third successive meeting. The Fed also hinted at three rate cuts in 2024, with further rate cuts expected in 2025 as inflation cools down amid sturdy economic growth.', 'The third-quarter GDP has already increased at the fastest annual rate in two years as consumers opened up their wallets to splurge on discretionary items.', 'Conversely, inflation came in line with estimates, allowing the Fed to keep interest rates unaltered. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.1% month over month in November, while the annual rate went up 3.1%. However, year over year, the CPI declined following an uptick of 3.2% in October.', 'The core CPI that eliminates volatile energy and food prices was up 0.3% month over month and 4% from a year ago. Both data were in line with market’s expectations and changed little from a month earlier.', 'With interest rate cuts expected soon, companies from the utility and real estate sectors are poised to gain. Utilities, for instance, are capital-intensive businesses, which compels them to rely on third parties for funding. Thus, they have a high level of debt. In a low-interest-rate environment, they can pay off their debt and register profit.', ""It's also worth pointing out that in case of rising interest rates, credit ratings of utility companies may go down, and they will find it hard to get lenders. Moreover, they can’t borrow at realistic rates, eventually leading to an increase in operating costs."", 'Interest rate hikes are also a drag on real estate activities. The borrowing costs of real estate projects of construction companies increase amid higher interest rates and impact profit margins.', 'We have, thus, selected three stocks that are positioned to benefit from the Fed’s intention to slash interest rates. These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'American Water Works is a water supply and wastewater service provider.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Analysts. ', ""The primary reason most folks are attracted to the stock market is growth. If bets are timed right, then investment can double or even triple in value over a short period of time depending on the market conditions. This phenomenon is so integral to the stock market that we don't even have to look too far back in its history to see its illustration. This is because 2023 has been the year of artificial intelligence when it comes to stocks. San Francisco, California based OpenAI took the world by storm this year when it first introduced ChatGPT - the world's first chat bot based on generative AI - and then followed up GPT-4, one of the most advanced A.I. models on the planet."", ""This created a feverish stock buying frenzy that saw investors flock to A.I. companies to profit from their shares. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the rush to A.I. was the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA designs graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are essential to training and operating advanced A.I. models. So how does NVIDIA tie into our narrative of the stock market being one of the biggest deliverers of investment growth? Well, NVIDIA's potential to dominate the global A.I. conversation has led its shares to gain a whopping 249% year to date. What this means is that if you have invested $1,000 into its shares at the start of this year, then your investment would be worth $3,490 right now, leaving you with more than three times what you had in January."", ""While NVIDIA is one of the biggest growth stories of this year, as a whole, investors have some tools up their sleeves when it comes to classifying growth stocks. One of these is the price to earnings (P/E) ratio. A P/E ratio evaluates the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's shares over its earnings. Generally, the higher the P/E ratio is w.r.t the industry multiple, the stronger the 'growth sentiment' about a company is. This is because investors are 'pricing in' future earnings growth through the share price by paying a higher price now with the hope that earnings will increase in the future."", ""However, growth is not an absolute principle for the stock market. The market's ability to deliver principal growth is quite dependent on the broader economic environment. Once again, since 2022 and 2023 have been some of the most historic years for the market, we don't have to look too far back to see how this works. 2022 was marked by record high inflation fueled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the low interest rates during the pandemic era. To bring inflation down, the Federal Reserve aggressively jacked up interest rates, which isn't great for either the market or growth stocks. Higher interest rates mean that money flows into high rate securities since they are essentially risk free. This made the stock market lose, and for growth stocks, this was compounded by inflation. Inflation isn't great for growth stocks, and not only for their market performance. Higher inflation means firms can not comfortably invest in the future, the demand for their products drops, and they have to tighten their belts to maintain stability."", 'Yet, with 2023 coming to an end, the tides of the stock market appear to be shifting. This is because there is a growing consensus among investors that the Federal Reserve has finished hiking rates, making them adjust their investments accordingly. This made us think about making a list of the top growth stocks that analysts believe are promising. Within this list, some top picks are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).', 'ja-san-miguel-xYSp0kkIUio-unsplash', 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the growth stocks that analysts believe are promising, we ranked the top 30 constituents of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF by their average analyst share price target upside.

The new panel, which tests for 88 compounds, covers a broad array of drug classes, such as designer opioids, designer benzodiazepines, designer stimulants, fentanyl analogs, synthetic cannabinoids, and other illicit additives. Two of these classes are rapidly accelerating America\'s overdose crisis: other illicit additives (xylazine) and fentanyl analogs (acetyl fentanyl). The new test panel is designed to help healthcare providers detect potential drug misuse in patients prescribed controlled medications, such as opioids and other substances, amid a proliferation of synthetic or ""designer"" drugs in the nation\'s drug supply.', 'NPS are versions of established prescription and illicit drugs that are routinely chemically altered to enhance drug effects and evade tracking by law enforcement. As their chemical composition frequently evolves, conventional point-of-care and laboratory test methods may fail to detect NPS, increasing risks for individual patients and challenging efforts to understand their long-term health effects or prevalence in communities.', ""The Quest panel uses definitive liquid chromatography with advanced tandem mass spectrometry-based testing to establish NPS misuse. Quest's team of toxicologists, medical experts and data analysts will periodically review and update the panel to include the most relevant and prevalent substances present in communities, as reflected by trends in the company's nationally representative Health Trends® dataset and the latest reports from public health, academic research and law enforcement organizations."", 'Quest developed the panel to address the changing drug epidemic, as revealed by its nationally representatives Health Trends® report, ""Drug Misuse in America 2023: The Growing Crisis of Novel Psychoactive Substances."" Based on more than 3.6 million clinical laboratory drug tests performed by Quest Diagnostics in 2022, the report provides insights into the drug crisis and its shifts from misuse of prescription opioids and fentanyl to NPS. The report also includes analysis of 3,730 randomly selected ""remnant"" specimens tested using a pilot version of the new NPS test panel.', 'Approximately 13.1% of remnant specimens tested were positive for at least one NPS. Of these, the animal tranquilizer xylazine was found in 8.1%, or nearly 1 in 12 specimens tested, making it the most prevalent single NPS. Yet, non-xylazine substances, including fentanyl analogs and designer benzodiazepines, were found in 5% of remnant specimens tested, or roughly 40% of all NPS-positive test results.', 'These findings align with a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlighting the increasing connection between xylazine and opioid overdose deaths while also revealing growing misuse of other NPS.', 'Additional key findings include:', 'Xylazine positivity among fentanyl-positive specimens was most prevalent in the Southeast (~90%), Northeast (~80%) and Eastern (~60%) U.S. regions. Results in the Southwest (<30%) and on the West Coast (<20%) suggest xylazine has yet to fully penetrate these U.S. regions.', 'One third (32.7%) of\xa0fentanyl positive specimens were also positive for xylazine and nearly all (97.7%) specimens positive for xylazine were also positive for fentanyl.', 'Nearly 1 in 5 (19%) amphetamines-positive specimens showed fentanyl combining.', 'Heroin use rapidly declined, as positivity overall fell from 1.1% in 2021 to 0.4% in 2022.', 'The Health Trends analysis also found that specimens in areas with demographics linked to low income levels were nearly 7 times more likely to test positive for nonprescribed fentanyl than those linked to high-income communities. The researchers theorize that these differences are due to comparatively higher quality of care and generally greater access to resources in high-income communities.', 'To access the full Health Trends report, click here.', '""Our Health Trends data demonstrates the importance of considering all possible NPS, not just xylazine, in clinical drug testing,"" said Harvey W. Kaufman, M.D., medical director and head of the Health Trends research program. ""The faster public health and policy makers catch up with the growing problem of synthetic drugs, the greater the likelihood of curbing a dangerous and evolving drug epidemic before more lives are lost and more families and communities suffer irreversible harm.""', 'For more information, please visit www.QuestDrugMonitoring.com.', ""Quest Diagnostics Health Trends studies are performed on aggregate deidentified laboratory data in compliance with applicable privacy regulations and the company's strict privacy policies, and follow procedures approved by the WCG Institutional Review Board.
