It has amassed assets over $11.98 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.90%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 18.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.77% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 20.85% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFNDX seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF has gained about 10.75% so far this year and is up about 13.15% in the last one year (as of 09/15/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.76 and $59.78.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 16.96% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 733 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FNDX is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $50.97 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $102.27 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While there are similarities with regional banks, Schwab has minimal credit risk and far higher organic growth than traditional banks. In addition, Schwab’s mostly retail customers are not pulling money out of its ecosystem. On the contrary, the company continues to grow client assets at a mid-single-digit percentage rate despite the banking selloff. Concerned over interest rate risk, we trimmed our position last year and earlier this year. As the stock pulled back this spring, we added back aggressively. It remains an exceptionally strong franchise in terms of asset gathering and customer loyalty and runs a unique business model that continues to attract client assets; we are pleased to have the opportunity to express our differentiated view.""Story continuesBest bank stocks for 2021Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retiring to Germany, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Germany.On Retiring ComfortablyOn average, Americans need an estimated $1.8 million to retire comfortably, according to a new survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). Marci Stewart, director of communication consulting and participant education for The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)'s Workplace Financial Services, notes that the impact of inflation and market volatility has raised this estimate from $1.7 million a year ago. A “retirement gap” is also partly to blame, depicting the gap between what potential retirees have saved and what they will need when they retire.A Vanguard study further notes that, on average, Americans aged 65 or older only have $233,000 saved in their retirement accounts. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) study further highlights that fewer workers are now confident whether they will have enough savings to last them through their retirement years. Only 37% now believe they can save enough for retirement, a 10% drop from the previous year.While there are many possible ways that potential retirees can use to boost their savings for retirement, the Motley Fool recommends investing in proven winners that have dominant market share positions and stellar balance sheets, such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Investing as little as $5,000 can work wonders for retirement.Unsurprisingly, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) accounts for 3% of all drinks consumed globally. Q2, 2023 saw The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO)'s organic sales rise by 11% while the operating profit margin rose by 32% as well. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated an operating profit of $24 billion in the company's Q4, 2023 quarter, up 21% year on year. Investing in proven stocks can help retirees save up the magic number they need for their retirement years.Story continuesRetiring to GermanyPotential retirees are exploring new options, considering where to spend their retirement years. Many flock to the Caribbean, while others go where they can to further stretch their retirement savings, such as Mexico, Panama, and cities in Central America. Another country on many retirees' wish list is Germany. Nestled in the heart of Europe, the country is the epitome of historical charm and contemporary living.There are many pros and cons of retiring to Germany. The healthcare system in the country is certainly one of the finest, and all residents have access to world-class healthcare facilities. Moreover, the quality of life is exceptionally high. The country is clean and green, the infrastructure is well-developed, and people respect the environment. The cities within offer diverse cultural experiences and picturesque beauty that captivates people from around the world.However, language is a prominent barrier for those who cannot speak German. Learning the language is an important factor when retiring here. Otherwise, accessing services, integrating into the community, and performing simple tasks such as grocery shopping may be challenging. As such, the best places to live in Germany for English speakers include Munich, Dusseldorf, and Bremen.For those wondering how to retire in Germany, or specifically, how to retire in Germany as an American, the country doesn’t have a specific retirement visa. An American can live in Germany without a visa for a period of 90 days. Staying longer in Germany will require you to apply for a temporary residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis) during the initial 90 days. The German visa requirements for residence include a passport, proof of German address, proof of health insurance and evidence that you can financially support yourself without working.15 Best Places to Retire in GermanyPhoto by Jacek Dylag on UnsplashMethodologyTo compile the list of the 15 best places to retire in Germany, we began by exploring expat forums such as Quora, Expat.com and Expat Forum to assess the best places recommended by expat retirees living in Germany.We also looked at other sources (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) recommending the best German places.

8,e096dc37-2d10-3bfc-93c6-aa4b016893ff,SCHW,2023-09-15,Is Schwab Small-Cap Equity (SWSCX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-small-cap-equity-swscx-110005733.html,1694689205,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Having trouble finding a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? Schwab Small-Cap Equity (SWSCX) is a potential starting point. SWSCX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWSCX. Schwab Small-Cap Equity debuted in June of 2003. Since then, SWSCX has accumulated assets of about $499.21 million, according to the most recently available information. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 4.11%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 14.22%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SWSCX's standard deviation over the past three years is 20.77% compared to the category average of 21.09%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 24.23% compared to the category average of 23.93%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. SWSCX has a 5-year beta of 1.16, which means it is likely to be more volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -6.75, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsExploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.Right now, 93.42% of this mutual fund's holdings are stocks and it has a negligible amount of assets in foreign securities. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:FinanceIndustrial CyclicalTechnologyHealthTurnover is 32%, which means, on average, the fund makes more trades per year than the comparable average.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWSCX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.09% compared to the category average of 1.18%. So, SWSCX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Small-Cap Equity ( SWSCX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab Small-Cap Equity ( SWSCX ) looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on SWSCXin the Mutual Fund Equity Report category.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.84%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.96%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.81%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 0.82% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.69% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.19% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Texas Instruments as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Texas Instruments to post earnings of $1.82 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 25.71%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $4.57 billion, down 12.86% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.34 per share and revenue of $18.03 billion. These totals would mark changes of -21.83% and -9.96%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant.

10,bf113239-909b-394c-aac9-eb3299cf4ad8,NUE,2023-09-15,Is Nucor Corporation's (NYSE:NUE) Recent Performance Tethered To Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporations-nyse-nue-recent-110117071.html,1694775677,STORY,['NUE'],"[Most readers would already know that Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) stock increased by 9.3% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Nucor's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Nucor How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nucor is:28% = US$5.9b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.28 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Nucor's Earnings Growth And 28% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Nucor has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Nucor's exceptional 39% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.As a next step, we compared Nucor's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 32%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Nucor is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Nucor Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Nucor's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 9.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (91%) of its profits. So it looks like Nucor is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, Nucor has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 20% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 12%) over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Nucor's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

(POSCO), South Korea’s largest steelmaker as well as a leader in energy trading and power generation, announced today that the companies are evaluating a joint venture to construct a low-carbon clean ammonia plant at CF Industries’ Blue Point Complex in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, United States, along with long-term low-carbon clean ammonia offtake into South Korea.As part of their evaluation, CF Industries and POSCO will initiate a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study on autothermal reforming (ATR) ammonia production technology. ATR technology, when combined with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the ammonia production process by more than 90% compared to conventional ammonia plants without CCS, enabling the resulting low-carbon clean ammonia to comply with the South Korean government’s Clean Hydrogen Energy Portfolio Standard.Should the project move forward, POSCO expects to import low-carbon clean ammonia from the facility to South Korea to support decarbonization of POSCO's own and third-party coal-based power generation facilities. Additionally, POSCO intends to convert low-carbon clean ammonia into hydrogen in order to use low-carbon hydrogen in gas-based power plants and in the steel-making process itself.""We are pleased to collaborate with POSCO to support both their decarbonization goals as well as those of South Korea,"" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""POSCO’s concrete plans to use low-carbon ammonia to accelerate decarbonization in steel manufacturing and power generation in South Korea represent significant new demand for low-carbon ammonia as a clean energy source.

He further explained, ""We plan to establish a production hub for clean ammonia in the United States in collaboration with CF Industries, the largest ammonia producer, and secure a stable supply network to timely provide clean hydrogen necessary for domestic power generation and hydrogen reduction steelmaking.""The FEED study is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024, with a final investment decision by CF Industries and POSCO to follow.Since 2020, CF Industries has advanced industry-leading projects to decarbonize its ammonia production network and position the Company to supply a substantial volume of low-carbon clean ammonia within the next few years. This includes leveraging CCS technologies at its Donaldsonville Complex where CF Industries is constructing a CO2 dehydration and compression facility to enable the capture and permanent sequestration of up to 2 million tons of CO2 per year with ExxonMobil, starting in 2025. The Company has also commenced a front-end engineering and design study with Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. to construct a greenfield low-carbon clean ammonia facility utilizing steam methane reforming (SMR) ammonia technology along with CCS at its Blue Point Complex in Louisiana. Additionally, CF Industries is constructing North America’s first commercial scale green ammonia capacity at its Donaldsonville Complex, enabling up to 20,000 tons of green ammonia production beginning in 2024.About CF Industries Holdings, Inc.At CF Industries, our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably.

The company has also outperformed its industry’s decline of 12.6% over the same time frame. Moreover, it has topped the S&amp;P 500’s 7.5% rise over the same period.Let’s take a look at the factors behind this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s price appreciation. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research CF Gains on Higher Nitrogen Demand, Lower Gas CostsCF Industries is benefiting from healthy nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and lower natural gas costs amid headwinds from lower nitrogen prices. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on rising nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally.In North America, demand for nitrogen is expected to be driven by high levels of corn planted acres in the United States and favorable farm economics. Increased planted corn acres, higher crop prices and healthy farm economics are also likely to support urea demand in Brazil. CF also expects demand in India to be driven by the government’s plans to maintain high urea volumes in stock.Lower natural gas prices are also acting in the company’s favor. CF Industries saw a significant decline in natural gas costs in the second quarter of 2023. Average cost of natural gas fell to $2.75 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2023 from $7.05 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Lower natural gas costs led to a decline in the company's cost of sales. The benefits of reduced gas costs are expected to continue in the third quarter.The company also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $712 million in the second quarter. During the first half of 2023, CF repurchased 3.1 million shares for $205 million, which included the purchase of 2 million shares for $130 million in the second quarter.Story continues CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

20,e5faa182-a36c-3226-b01c-6db9da8b3f7c,CTAS,2023-09-15,Is Cintas Corporation's (NASDAQ:CTAS) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-corporations-nasdaq-ctas-latest-120024873.html,1694779224,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Cintas' (NASDAQ:CTAS) stock is up by a considerable 7.1% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Cintas'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Cintas How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cintas is:35% = US$1.3b ÷ US$3.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Cintas' Earnings Growth And 35% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Cintas has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 8.6% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Cintas was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.Next, on comparing Cintas' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 9.1% over the last few years.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Cintas is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Cintas Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Cintas has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 34% (or a retention ratio of 66%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, Cintas has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 30% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Cintas' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 33% for future ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Cintas' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Cintas (CTAS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CTAS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Cintas' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Cintas' main business drivers.Founded in 1968 and headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, Cintas Corporation provides specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. It also operates in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company designs, manufactures, implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products and first aid and safety products for diversified businesses.Notably, the company provides products and services through distribution and retail channels to small service and manufacturing companies as well as leading corporations.The company primarily reports revenues under two operating segments — Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services.Uniform Rental and Facility Services (78.2% of fiscal 2023 revenues) segment includes rental, and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels as well as the provision for restroom supplies, and other facility products and services. Further, selling items from catalogs to customer routes are reported under this segment.First Aid and Safety Services (10.8% of fiscal 2023 revenues) segment includes the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training to customers.Businesses, with Uniform Direct Sale and Fire Protection Services, are included in All Other. Revenues generated from All Other businesses represented 11% of fiscal 2023 revenues.Story continuesIt's worth mentioning here that results of First Aid and Safety Services segment and All Other businesses are grouped under Other Services in Cintas' income statement.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Cintas ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in September 2013 would be worth $10,357.95, or a 935.79% gain, as of September 14, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 164.66% and the price of gold increased 38.54% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for CTAS.Strong segmental performances have been aiding Cintas. Increased productivity level and new product launches are boosting the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment’s performances. Strength in the health and wellness businesses and high customer retention levels are driving the growth of the First Aid and Safety Services segment. The company's focus on enhancement of its product portfolio holds promise. Cintas’ efforts to reward shareholders are impressive. Amid these positives, shares of the company have outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. However, the rising cost of sales, and increasing selling and administrative expenses pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. High tax rate is an added concern for Cintas. Also, foreign currency headwinds are weighing on the company's top line.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) , and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). These companies are known to perform well by serving their stakeholders to position themselves well in their respective industries. Let’s take a look at all of them.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology company that specializes in consumer electronics. Its broad range of products including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, have penetrated across the world.

It reported that the company partnered with Southbank Centre to launch its first cohort of 80 black art professionals to equip them with technology and skills through sessions with experts from the film, music, or photography industry.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a popular US chain of retail hypermarkets and discount stores. The company has secured several international recognitions as a result of its efforts to be sustainable. In the company's environmental, social, and governance highlights for 2023, the company reported that it is listed on the Bloomberg 2023 gender equality index and EPA's green power partnership rankings as the number 1 retailer to use green power resources. The company has been working on its priority of achieving zero waste in its operations. The employee statistics for the company are also promising as 88% of the US associates who got a promotion in 2023 started from entry level. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) offers an hourly compensation of $21.75 to its US associates which includes many women and people of color as well.Another company that is acclaimed at a global level is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company continues to earn its name in the market by immensely supporting its employees. On August 19, the company reported some of its employee empowerment programs where it mentioned that its Career Choice program covers tuition fees for its employees enrolled in associate degrees, professional certifications, or bachelor’s degrees in addition to providing mentoring and career counseling. This depicts a deep level of concern and understanding for employees.Now that we have taken a look at the most renowned companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and some efforts that make them admirable, let's examine the most admired companies in 2023.25 Most Admired Companies in 2023Copyright: yuliufu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyIn order to create a list of the 25 most admired companies in the world, we reviewed the Fortune most admired companies for 2023. Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

They are part of a council of leaders affiliated with Welcome.US, a group dedicated to helping support refugees in the United States.They were meeting with Zients and other White House officials ""to discuss specific ways we can continue to work together to support safe, orderly pathways for people in need of safety to come to the United States, including through refugee resettlement and new, expanded humanitarian sponsorship programs,"" a White House official told Reuters ahead of the meeting.Gap CEO Richard Dickson, Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, Lyft Inc CEO David Risher, Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya, and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert also attended, along with representatives from Airbnb, Goldman Sachs, Meta and others.The White House said after the meeting that the officials and executives discussed long-term needs of refugees but also solutions to immediate ones, including providing credits for ride-share services and money for public transportation, increasing offers of pro bono legal services, and helping people eligible to work to get jobs.They also talked about mentorship working with communities to sponsor and welcome refugees, it said.""Today’s meeting highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in building durable and scalable capacity to better respond to the global displacement crisis,"" the White House said in a statement.New York Governor Kathy Hochul met Zients and other senior administration officials last month to discuss an influx of migrants in New York City that has strained its resources.Story continuesRepublicans have hammered Biden, a Democrat, for his policies on immigration, and the issue is likely to feature prominently in the 2024 presidential campaign, when Biden, who is running for re-election, is likely to face former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination and an immigration hardliner.Biden sought at the beginning of his administration to recast the U.S. immigration system, but appetite in Congress for comprehensive reform legislation has been low.The White House, which says it wants to partner with the private sector to build a humane immigration system, worked with Welcome.US to help Afghan refugees coming to the United States after Biden pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.Welcome.US and its CEO Council have worked with the administration to ""implement the largest expansion of humanitarian sponsorship pathways to safety in the United States in recent history,"" a representative for the group said.

Quarterly non-GAAP earnings (excluding 36 cents from non-recurring items) of 37 cents per share surpassed the consensus estimate by 8.8%. Nonetheless, the bottom line decreased 50% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating revenues of $361.1 million also outpaced the consensus mark by 8.7% but declined marginally year over year.What’s Boding Well?Green Dot's focus is on long-term growth, aiming to acquire and retain users, enhance brand image, boost product awareness, increase card usage, and cater to a wide consumer range from the unbanked to the fully banked.The company's banking-as-a-service (BaaS) partnerships with major players like Amazon, Apple, Intuit, and Uber, expand its market reach.

Since 2007, it has provided Walmart-branded GPS cards, with Green Dot Bank handling these accounts since 2014. Green Dot manages all aspects of the Walmart MoneyCard program, including IT, compliance, customer service, and more. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, revenues from Walmart-related products and services accounted for 21%, 24%, and 27% of total operating revenues, respectively.Key RisksGreen Dot experiences seasonal revenue fluctuations, primarily influenced by a significant number of taxpayers opting for direct deposit of their tax refunds onto its cards during the first half of each year. Moreover, its tax refund processing services exhibit strong seasonality, with the majority of revenues being generated in the first quarter and almost all of it in the first half of each calendar year. The company anticipates ongoing revenue variability in future periods due to these seasonal dynamics.Story continuesGreen Dot's current ratio at the end of the second quarter was pegged at 0.36, lower than the prior-year quarter’s 0.37.

Its machine-learning algorithm relies on weather patterns and each store's past sales data to predict inventory needs of its more than 4,700 U.S. locations, a Walmart tech executive told Reuters.The software is just one example of the novel ways retailers are trying to keep their inventories under control. Excess stock dragged profits last year for Walmart, Target, Kohl's, Macy's and Gap.Holiday sales in the United States are estimated to grow at their slowest pace in five years. Shoppers face higher interest rates and student loan payments restarting on Oct. 1, making retailers' bets on inventories ""very important,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker said.Just one year ago, when inflation soared and supply chain clogs eased, Walmart had over $60 billion in inventory, far exceeding shopper demand. That led to a 25% drop in quarterly profits, after it sharply discounted clothing and general merchandise, eroding its profit margins.The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer's use of algorithms to forecast demand and its use of robotics helped it make the ""adjustments that we needed to make when things changed dramatically on us last year,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Tuesday at an investor conference.Inventories are now ""in good shape"" he said, and ""I think (the) holiday (season) is going to be pretty good.""Overall Walmart's goal is to manage its stores so that its operating profits increase at a faster rate than its sales, its executives said.Story continuesTo be sure, rival Amazon has long led the way in e-commerce technology, said Thomas Hayes, chairman at New York-based equity manager Great Hill Capital, which owns Amazon shares but not Walmart shares. For example, Amazon captured nearly a third of the $1.1 trillion in online purchases in 2022 compared to Walmart's 6%, according to data research firm Euromonitor.Walmart executives say it is aided by its large tech team in India, spanning three cities and employing 11,500. Its Bengaluru office, its biggest tech hub, employs 8,000, versus U.S. rivals Target's roughly 4,000 workers and Lowe's 4,300 in the same city.Walmart's India team led development of software programs to solve some of its most challenging U.S. problems, Hari Vasudev, executive vice president of technology, told Reuters in interviews. That includes excess inventory, which is costly, and issues with curbside pickup and delivery orders.Software directs Walmart workers to use the quickest route while assembling online orders for pickup and delivery, Vasudev said. Workers pick items that are in proximity one after another in its U.S. stores, helping them put together orders in less than two minutes on average, he said.The compounded annual growth of online pickup and delivery orders was 50% over the past three years and has been the biggest component of Walmart's e-commerce growth, the retailer's chief financial officer said in August.Vasudev said that the more data its algorithms are fed, the more accurate the predictions.David Klink, senior equity analyst at Hunting Private Bank, said precise inventory management could lead to higher capital returns for investors.

Middle market dealmaking has continued to remain more resilient than broader M&amp;A markets, as total transaction volume across all deal sizes declined 24.8% YOY. Anecdotally, dealmakers are noting a buildup in transaction inventory, with the expectation for a rebound towards Q1 2024. In addition, following recent years of COVID bumps to revenue, the market has entered a more normalized EBITDA environment for many private businesses. Strategics have continued to pursue quality companies, and while sponsors have largely held off on exits, they have continued to actively evaluate investment opportunities.Following 525 basis points of interest rates hikes since March 2022, the unemployment rate has hovered near 3.5% in 2023, equity markets have recorded positive gains, and consumer spending has incrementally ticked upwards—a scenario that may have been deemed an unrealistic best case outcome at the start of the Fed's monetary tightening campaign.

The U.S. has seemingly entered a structurally higher rate environment, one that may persist in the near-term. However, through the first half of 2023, the economy has largely shown its ability to contend with a higher cost of capital. Equity indices have continued to record healthy returns, despite a higher rate environment, and even shrugged off a downgrade to U.S. debt. Continued disinflation in the following quarters will likely prove pivotal for near-term economic growth. Through the first half of 2023, macroeconomic headwinds have failed to derail a resilient U.S. economy—which bodes well for near-term dealmaking opportunities.Story continuesM&amp;A valuations compressed in Q2 compared to the prior year, falling nearly a full turn to 9.2x EV/EBITDA from 10.0x EV/EBITDA. Rising interest rates have facilitated a tightened lending environment, contributing to downward pressure on transaction pricing. However, quality businesses with sustainable cash flows and a track record of performance have continued to attract buyer attention. Buyers have also increasingly sought businesses with revenues driven by volume growth, rather than elevated prices, an important consideration as U.S. disinflation has continued to moderate the cost environment.Middle market deal activity has continually showcased its resilience as business owners do not always have the option to wait out market turbulence. Deal markets ebb and flow as economic cycles permit but the drivers of private markets differ from other areas of the economy. LPs demand return on their invested capital, and strategics in competitive markets are in constant need of operational synergies and new growth channels—all amid one of the most notable wealth transfers in history as the baby boomer generation ages. The exact future inflection point in M&amp;A activity cannot be known, but it is likely sooner than many had forecasted.""After a historic 2021 for M&amp;A, recessionary fears coupled with rising interest rates and challenging credit markets created a wait-and-see mentality for business owners from Q2 2022 through Q2 2023 regarding the M&amp;A market. However, Q3 2023 has shown a steady increase in business owner response and owners' willingness to transact in 2024. From the conversations we have had in Q3 2023, there is an appearing latent interest in dealmaking and accessing capital and we anticipate those businesses that are best prepared will be in a prime position to capture opportunities as the fog lifts,"" said Peter Asiaf, Head of Business Development at Capstone Partners.Also included in this report:Key considerations for middle market business owners regarding dry powder levels, buyer appetite, lending conditions, and M&amp;A pricing trends.Commentary on the primary drivers of transaction volume and valuations through Q2 2023.A breakdown of private equity dealmaking activity and data on dry powder reserves.An overview on equity private capital market conditions, featuring Capstone's Equity Capital Advisory group.How to leverage a Quality of Technology assessment, featuring Capstone's Financial Advisory Services group.To access to full report, click here.ABOUT CAPSTONE PARTNERSFor over 20 years, the firm has been a trusted advisor to leading middle market companies, offering a fully integrated range of investment banking and financial advisory services uniquely tailored to help owners, investors, and creditors through each stage of the company's lifecycle.

The cyberattack resulted in downed websites and slot machines and staffers to check people into hotel rooms manually. The group has been causing havoc across North American companies in 2023, according to Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at Crowdstrike Holdings Inc., who said in an interview last month that the attacks had escalated to “a couple a week.”The same group was behind an earlier attack on Caesars Entertainment Inc., according to the people. Caesars paid tens of millions of dollars to the hackers, who broke into the company’s systems and threatened to release data, according to two of the people.On Thursday, Caesars said in a regulatory filing that it discovered suspicious activity in its information technology network “resulting from a social engineering attack on an outsourced IT support vendor used by the company.” The identity of the vendor wasn’t immediately known. “We have taken steps to ensure that the stolen data is deleted by the unauthorized actor, although we cannot guarantee this result,” Caesars said in the filing.It’s still not clear how the attackers broke into MGM, which has declined to comment on specifics of the incident.Read more: MGM, Caesars Hacked by ‘Scattered Spider’ in Span of WeeksStory continuesThey are “incredibly effective social engineers,” said Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer for Mandiant Inc., which has investigated the group in depth. He described the hacking group, which Mandiant first came across in May 2022, as “one of the most prevalent and aggressive threat actors impacting organizations in the United States today.”Members of Scattered Spider are based in the US and UK, some as young as 19 years old, according to four cybersecurity researchers familiar with the group. One of the group had a “mid-Atlantic” accent, according to Meyers, who listened into one of the first calls one of the hackers made to try to steal passwords, which was automatically recorded by the victim.The hackers are renowned for calling or texting IT help desk workers and impersonating employees to trick them into sharing credentials. This has included cloud computing accounts like Microsoft Azure and hypervisor tools such as AnyDesk and FleetDeck – which allow information technology employees to take over a computer remotely when someone has a technical problem, according to Meyers. To stay undetected, the hackers use a virtual private network that makes it appear as if they are based in the same area as the victim account holder, so logging in won’t raise alarm bells with the IT team.Mandiant, a cybersecurity company owned by Alphabet Inc.’s Google, released more details Thursday about the group, which they refer to as UNC3944. In one incident that Mandiant’s ransomware experts dealt with, the gang took over a Human Resources department worker’s Microsoft Teams video-conferencing software to contact their colleagues and lead them to a Microsoft-themed phishing page to steal more credentials. Mandiant said when its incident response team communicated with the hackers on behalf of its clients, they “engaged in aggressive communications with victims, such as leaving threatening notes within a text file on a system, contacting executives via text messages and emails.”According to Mandiant and Meyers, the attackers appear to have graduated from sim-swapping circles, in which a hacker bribes or convinces a telecommunications employee to port a victim’s number onto a new phone so the hacker can bypass two-factor authentication to gain access to software such as Gmail and Microsoft Outlook, as well as cryptocurrency and personal bank accounts.Reached via the social media app Telegram, a person who identified as a member of Scattered Spider said the group numbers fewer than 10 people, mostly friends, and has been involved in hacking since they were 11 years old.The person said the group picks targets carefully, focusing on companies valued from $15 billion to $45 billion, and that they don’t attack hospitals, oil refineries and power plants. The group’s motive is to get rich quickly and get away with it, the person said.Bloomberg News couldn’t independently verify the person’s identity or affiliation with the hacking group. However, three cybersecurity experts assessed that the Telegram user was linked to the hacking group.Read more: Useless Slots, Cash Bars Annoy Casino Goers After MGM HackScattered Spider has previously deployed a type of ransomware known as ALPHV to extort victims, according to Carmakal. Ransomware is a type of malware that locks up a victim’s files, and the hackers then demand payment to unlock them.ALPHV is also the name of a hacking group that developed the ransomware, which it leases out to others — known as affiliates — for a fee. ALPHV was first detected in November 2021. ALPHV uses a programming language named Rust, which helps it evade conventional cybersecurity detection measures and makes it harder for incident responders to reverse engineer the attackers’ malware code, according to Microsoft Threat Intelligence.The FBI said in April 2022 that ALPHV ransomware had been used in at least 60 attacks worldwide.ALPHV is likely Russia-based, said Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the cybersecurity company Emsisoft. He is among experts who believe the group evolved from earlier Russian hacking outfits that disbanded following a spate of high-profile ransomware attacks, including the 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline Co.In a statement posted on the group’s dark web page on Thursday, ALPHV said that it deployed ransomware on MGM servers after representatives from the company didn’t respond to its ransom request. The group deployed ransomware on Sept. 11, the statement said, adding that they still have access to some of MGM’s infrastructure. Claims that teenagers from the US and UK broke into MGM were just rumors, according to the statement.A MGM spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on ALPHV’s claims.Alex Waintraub, an incident responder at the cybersecurity company Cygnvs Inc. said he has directly negotiated about 25 times with ALPHV since 2021 on behalf of hacked companies that call in cyber insurance to help.The group’s ransom demands are all over the map, he said. “There is no pattern,” Waintraub said, adding that he has been able to talk down ransom demands by 70%.The exact nature of the relationship between Scattered Spider and ALPHV isn’t known.However, the representative of Scattered Spider said the groups have worked together multiple times and that Scattered Spider was grateful for ALPHV’s help in attacks on some companies. The person boasted that Scattered Spider and ALPHV were just getting started.--With assistance from Jamie Tarabay.(Updates with comments from cybersecurity investigators beginning in the second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekStarbucks Has 383 Billion Different Lattes and That’s a ProblemMBAs Are Spurning McKinsey to Buy Small CompaniesWhy Dollar General Might Just Be the Worst Retail Job in AmericaAmbani’s Plan to Upend Indian Finance Lands With a ThudTikTok Shop Is a Real E-Commerce Threat©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

""They appear to be native English speakers under the umbrella of a Russia-based operation called ALPHV or BlackCat.”Scattered Spider also is known as UNC3944, said Charles Carmakal, chief technical officer at cybersecurity firm Mandiant. He called the group “incredibly disruptive and aggressive” in recent targeting of hospitality and entertainment organizations.“They leverage tradecraft that is challenging for many organizations with mature security programs to defend against,” Carmakal said in a statement.Mandiant said in a blog analysis published Thursday the group uses SMS text phishing and phone calls to help desks to attempt to obtain password resets or multifactor bypass codes.“This relatively new entrant in the ransomware industry has hit at least 100 organizations, most of them in the U.S. and Canada,” Mandiant said.Caesars is the largest casino owner in the world, with more than 65 million Caesars Rewards members and properties in 18 states and Canada under the Caesars, Harrah’s, Horseshoe and Eldorado brands. It also has mobile and online operations and sports betting. Company officials did not respond to emailed questions from The Associated Press.Story continuesThe company told the SEC that loyalty program customers were being offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection.There was no evidence the intruder obtained member passwords or bank account and payment card information, the company reported, adding that operations at casinos and online “have not been impacted by this incident and continue without disruption.”The disclosure by Caesars came after MGM Resorts International, the largest casino company in Las Vegas, reported publicly on Monday that a cyberattack that it detected Sunday led it to shut down computer systems at its properties across the U.S. to protect data.MGM Resorts said reservations and casino floors in Las Vegas and other states were affected. Customers shared stories on social media about not being able to make credit card transactions, obtain money from cash machines or enter hotel rooms. Some video slot machines were dark.MGM Resorts has has about 40 million loyalty rewards members and tens of thousands of hotel rooms in Las Vegas at properties including the MGM Grand, Bellagio, Aria and Mandalay Bay. It also operates properties in China and Macau.A company report on Tuesday to the SEC pointed to its Monday news release. The FBI said an investigation was ongoing but offered no additional information.Some MGM Resorts computer systems were still down Thursday, including hotel reservations and payroll. But company spokesman Brian Ahern said its 75,000 employees in the U.S. and abroad were expected to be paid on time.Callow, speaking by telephone from British Columbia, Canada, called most media accounts of the incidents speculative because information appeared to be coming from the same entities that claim to have carried out the attacks. He said recovery from cyberattacks can take months.Callow pointed to reports that he called “plausible” that Caesars Entertainment was asked to pay $30 million for a promise to secure its data and may have paid $15 million. He also noted that the company did not describe in the SEC report the steps taken to ensure that the stolen data was secure.The highest ransom believed to have been paid to cyber-attackers was $40 million by insurance giant CNA Financial, Callow said, following a data breach in March 2021.“In these cases, organizations basically pay to get a ‘pinky promise,’” he said. “There is no way to actually know that (hackers) do delete (stolen data) or that it won't be used elsewhere.”____Associated Press technology writer Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this report.]"

Yahoo Finance Live discusses the story and some of the impacts the attack may have.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: We're bringing down some of the trending stories we've had our eyes on today, guys. And I've had my eyes on the casino stocks taking a hit lower yesterday, and still some issues today related to a cybersecurity issue. Now, we're mainly talking about MGM here. But Bloomberg also reporting that Caesars had problems as well.MGM had had issues with a cybersecurity attack for several days impacting some of the casino-- some of the machines at the casino, like slot machines. And I think it brings up two interesting concerns when you think about it overall, would be A, if my personal information is anywhere in any of these casinos, whether or not that's what the hackers are going for, you're going to be worried, right? Just as a general consumer, I think you're worried.But also, interesting to see some of the tech at MGM'S casinos shut down. The Wall Street Journal did a great story today sort of digging into what it's like right now in Vegas. And you have some people that went to Vegas to go gamble at an MGM casino.And then, they A, either don't want to because they're not sure that they want to do it, or B, they've gone to machines and some of the machines are out of order right now. So you're seeing a little bit of two things at play. For me, I think most concerning is always my information getting out there, right?- Yeah. And you couldn't even use ATM machines, which if you're at a casino, you need the ATM to get--- You've got to go get more money.JOSH SCHAFER: So then you can give it to them.- Exactly. But then, to your point, if you do put a debit card in there, could that potentially be exposed? It seems like a lot of these companies-- but really, the consumer is just so vulnerable. And I know, Josh, you were talking about how, we were discussing before the segment started, about how much we rely on our data being protected at the end of the day.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: That's the example here to me. The scariest part of this is just like you have no control over where any of your data is, because I want to use Apple Pay everywhere I go. So my information is just out there. And if they get hacked, that's a big what am I going to do?- I'm just concerned that Vegas casinos-- is it Ocean's Eleven hackers? Usually, it's Fort Knox right over there. Money is number one. They are making sure no one's--- Where's George Clooney?- And you couldn't even check into your room. Cashiers are writing out checks for a penny. People are cashing out a penny on the floors. Absolute chaos, right?All intertwined. Your hotel card, your winnings. The MGM sports betting, too, also got impacted. It's wild how this happened. And I can't believe it happened at a casino.Where is George Clooney and Brad Pitt, and all these guys? Where are they? What's going on behind the scenes? That's all I'm asking.- I completely agree. Total Ocean's.- It's crazy, yeah.- They'll make a movie about this one day, for sure.JOSH SCHAFER: Oh, really?- I think so.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe we'll be featured in it. They'll play us in the beginning.]"

These include hacks of a third-party database serving Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen CarePath; a data file sharing service that affected millions including recipients of Medicare; and of a cloud-storage environment related to online password management service LastPass.In a Sept. 14 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Caesars said that it is still investigating the scope of the breach but that on Sept. 7 an unauthorized actor acquired a copy of its loyalty program database, including information such as driver’s license numbers and/or social security numbers for a “significant number” of members.“We have no evidence to date that any member passwords/PINs, bank account information or payment card information were acquired by the unauthorized actor,” Caesar said in the filing. The company said it will notify those affected by the breach on a rolling basis in the coming weeks.The company said it recently identified suspicious activity in its information technology (IT) network resulting from a social engineering attack on an outsourced IT support vendor that it used. Caesars said its customer-facing operations including physical properties and online and mobile gaming applications were affected by the breach but that they continue without disruption.Certain MGM properties closed following attackAt MGM, meanwhile, certain systems at properties nationwide remain shuttered following a cyber attack publicly revealed on Sept. 12.

One such stock that merits attention is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH). The stock, which is currently priced at 17.12, recorded a gain of 4.68% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 11.4%.

The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnpacking the Risks of Investing in Norwegian Cruise Line HoldingsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.22, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a hidden gem or a value trap?Story continuesThese indicators suggest that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: Norwegian Cruise Line HoldingsNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths, operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028, Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's historical data, 2021: -0.13; 2022: -0.33; 2023: -0.38, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 28.67; 2020: 21.68; 2021: 0.08; 2022: 5.74; 2023: 16.54; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-32%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.Conclusion: Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapGiven the bearish signs of declining revenues and earnings, coupled with a low Altman Z-score, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings appears to be a potential value trap. While the stock's low price relative to its intrinsic value may seem attractive, the underlying risks associated with the company's financial health and performance cannot be ignored. Therefore, it's crucial for investors to conduct a thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.Stocks climbed on September 14 following robust economic reports, reigniting speculation that the Federal Reserve can orchestrate a gentle economic slowdown, even if it decides to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period. In contrast, the euro declined as expectations grew that the European Central Bank would maintain its current stance following a recent interest rate hike. The S&amp;P 500 approached the 4,500 mark. During the early part of the trading session on September 14, futures on equities briefly trimmed their gains, prompted by stronger-than-expected retail sales and producer price data, influenced in part by increased fuel expenses. Two-year Treasury yields remained relatively stable after surging immediately after the release of this economic data. The U.S. dollar recorded a marginal increase in value. Oil prices remained close to a 10-month peak as prominent forecasts increasingly point towards tight oil markets for the remainder of the year. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil continued to trade above $89 per barrel after a notable surge on Wednesday, reaching its highest intraday level since mid-November. This uptick in oil prices coincides with a series of reports from leading analysts. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), there is an anticipation of a ""significant supply shortfall"" in the upcoming months. Similarly, OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) estimates this deficit could be the largest in over a decade. Furthermore, the U.S. government also foresees a scenario where global consumption outpaces production, underscoring the growing concerns of a tightening oil market.The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised its main interest rate for the 10th consecutive time, prioritizing the battle against inflation over a weakening economy. This move has pushed the central bank's main deposit facility from -0.5% in June 2022 to a record 4%. One of the key drivers for this hike was upward revisions in the ECB's inflation projections, forecasting an average of 5.6% for this year (up from 5.4%) and 3.2% for next year (up from 3%). However, the ECB slightly lowered its medium-term forecast from 2.2% to 2.1%. The central bank also hinted that further rate hikes might be on hold for now, stating that the current interest rates would contribute significantly to returning inflation to the target if maintained. Following this announcement, the euro fell sharply, reaching a three-month low against the U.S. dollar. On the other hand, European stocks rallied, with the benchmark Stoxx 600 index up by 1.1%.Story continuesThe ECB also increased interest rates on its main refinancing operations and marginal lending facility by 25 basis points each, bringing them to 4.5% and 4.75%, respectively. The ECB also adjusted its economic growth projections for the euro area, with lower growth expectations for the coming years. According to CNBC, while there was uncertainty about the outcome of this ECB meeting, market sentiment leaned toward a rate hike, partly due to inflation concerns and oil market reports suggesting tighter supply and higher prices. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized the central bank's data-dependent approach but stressed the importance of the current rate levels in the fight against inflation. The German economy, the largest in Europe, has been experiencing a decline, with falling business sentiment and weakening services and manufacturing sectors. Despite this, the ECB proceeded with the rate hike to combat rising inflation. Market focus is now on the language used in the ECB's statement, particularly the inflation forecast for 2025, revised lower, and the indication that rates will be maintained at current levels for a ""sufficiently long duration,"" suggesting a flat rate path for some time.Photo by AlphaTradeZoneMeanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as American Electric Power Company, Inc.

MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.20 (-0.31%)On September 13, Jefferies Financial Group made a significant announcement regarding MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), a prominent insurance and financial services company. As of September 13, MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) stock was valued at $63.79, exhibiting a minor decrease of 0.3% from its previous price.

Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.08 (-0.13%)On September 13, JPMorgan analyst Lyndon Fagan played a pivotal role in the recent upgrade of Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), a prominent mining corporation. This upgrade, orchestrated by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., has generated significant interest in the financial world, with investors and analysts closely tracking Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stock performance. As of the latest available data, on September 13, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stock was valued at $63.11, reflecting a marginal decline of 0.1%. While various market factors may influence this slight fluctuation in stock price, the key development lies in the shift of analysts' sentiment. They have transitioned from a ""Neutral"" rating to an ""Overweight"" recommendation for Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stock. This upgrade suggests that Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) may present an attractive opportunity for those interested in the mining and resources sector.HL International Equity Strategy made the following comment about Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“In terms of geographical performance, the eurozone emerged as the top-performing region, and our stocks did better still, fueled by the strong performance of Infineon, L’Oréal, and Schneider Electric. EMs, which lagged the index, were boosted by the improving outlook for semiconductor companies TSMC and Samsung. Mexico’s FEMSA also contributed strongly to relative returns. Europe ex EMU was the weakest region primarily due to the underperformance of SE Banken and UK miner Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO). The latter was affected by concerns over softer iron ore pricing in the current year, another reflection of manufacturing weakness in steelmaking giant China.”07. Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.02 (-0.02%)On September 13, Jefferies Financial Group upgraded Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), a major player in the insurance and financial services industry. Jefferies analyst Suneet Kamath upgraded Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) from Underperform to Hold with a price target of $93.00 from $70.00. As of the latest data, Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) stock was trading at $96.58, showing no significant change at 0.02%. This upgrade signifies a change in perspective, indicating that Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) may be in a more stable position than previously thought. Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) may be a company to watch for those interested in the insurance and financial services sector after this upgrade.Much like American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP), UMB Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:UMBF) and ImmunoGen, Inc. (NASDAQ:IMGN), Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) is receiving a significant show of confidence from financial analysts on Wall Street.06. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.19 (+0.57%)On September 13, UBS Group revised its outlook on General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), one of the leading players in the automotive industry. This revision entails upgrading General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) status from a ""Neutral"" to a ""Buy"" recommendation, accompanied by an adjusted price target of $44, up from the previous target of $41. This change comes as a new analyst has assumed responsibility for covering General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and their analysis suggests that the market has already factored in a significant degree of pessimism. UBS Group's upgrade signifies a more positive outlook on General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stock. This change in recommendation implies that, according to UBS Group's analysis, GM's current valuation and market sentiment have considered many of the negative factors and uncertainties surrounding the automotive industry. The increased price target of $44 suggests that UBS Group believes there is untapped potential for General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stock to perform better than anticipated.Diamond Hill made the following comment about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Most recently, we initiated a position in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), one of the largest automakers in the United States. Over the past several years, GM has taken steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world. With the recent rise in interest rates there was a meaningful selloff in the auto industry, which presented us an attractive entry point to a name we know well.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts. Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks to Buy for Good Returns15 Good Stocks To Invest In13 Best Stocks To Invest In According to AIDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -11.86% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.52 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.26%. In comparison, the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield is 2.26%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.67%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.44%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. MetLife's current payout ratio is 33%. This means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MET expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.78 per share, with earnings expected to increase 13.58% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the week before the reduction, the plant was pulling in about 1.8 bcfd of pipeline gas.One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day.Even though U.S. gas demand will increase as Freeport pulls in more of the fuel to produce LNG, U.S. gas futures were little changed on Friday.Last year, when Freeport shut in June 2022 after an explosion and remained out of service for about eight months, gas prices spiked to record highs in Europe and Asia with the reduction in global LNG supplies.That's because the Freeport shutdown came as countries around the world were looking to stop importing fuel from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and were seeking gas supplies from other suppliers. The U.S. became the biggest supplier to many of those countries.In the U.S., meanwhile, gas prices collapsed due to the 2022 Freeport shutdown because the plant was not consuming the fuel, most of which ended up going into U.S. stockpiles.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Jason Neely)]"

But the key point at the moment is that complete shutdowns aren't yet expected,"" he said.Froley added that prices could rise further if these issues were to escalate into major shutdowns, but companies aren't looking to secure lots of alternative cargoes for now.Samuel Good, head of LNG pricing at commodity pricing agency Argus, said that the slowdown in feedgas supply this week at Freeport LNG suggests around four cargoes have so far been cancelled.""At least one Freeport offtaker has been heard to have been exploring options for sub-letting spare ships because of the loss of loadings and very high rates in the spot charter market,"" he added.Story continuesIn Europe, Dominic Gallagher, head of LNG broking at Tullet Prebon, said that along with disruption at Freeport, Norway's maintenance extensions and China's Sinopec unit, Unipec, issuing a peak winter tender, have resulted in a generally strong week for gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub, adding that ""further choppiness"" can be expected.S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily north-west Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in October on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $10.612/mmBtu on Sept. 14, a $0.50/mmBtu discount to the October gas price at the Dutch TTF gas hub.Argus assessed the north-west Europe DES price at $10.60/mmBtu, while Spark Commodities estimated the price at $10.558/mmBtu.Spot LNG Freight rates continued to climb this week as current LNG and freight prices show floating storage in north-west Europe from October until November is more profitable, thus tying up vessel availability. The Atlantic rates rose to $182,750/day on Friday, while the Pacific rates rose to $187,750/day, said Henry Bennett, head of pricing at Spark Commodities.(Reporting by Marwa Rashad; Editing by Nina Chestney)]"

Strike action there has helped push up gas prices.Brighter data from China meanwhile has helped lift sentiment across global markets, except for China, heading into the weekend.China's factory output and retail sales grew at a faster pace in August, but sentiment remains fragile given the country's property sector woes with expectations for bigger stimulus high.While Japan's Nikkei rose 1% and European shares opened higher, China shares reversed earlier gains .European markets continued to cheer the likely end of the European Central Bank's rate hiking cycle. The ECB on Thursday lifted rates to a record high of 4% but signalled that tightening was likely to be its last.And even if the ECB suggested rates would stay higher for longer, markets are already looking past that to rate cuts as economic growth weakens.Story continuesWall Street was tipped to open higher, judging by trade in U.S. equity futures.August U.S. industrial production data could add to recent signs of economic strength supporting investor sentiment.Lastly, hopes for a turnaround in the moribund market for initial public offerings are running high after SoftBank's Arm Holdings soared almost 25% above their Nasdaq debut price on Thursday.Arm shares jumped over 7% in pre-market trade Friday.

This, economists say, could be good for the Fed even if it means an uptick in headline inflation in the immediate term.""Oil prices have rallied, and for policymakers, this could be a blessing in disguise,"" Morgan Stanley's Ellen Zentner wrote in a note on Wednesday. ""We find that an increase in energy prices from negative supply shocks has only a small pass-through to core CPI while weighing on spending.""The Fed is focused on core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories. In August, core consumer prices rose 4.3% over last year — a slowdown from the 4.7% annual increase seen in July.While there are concerns that rising energy prices could spark price increases across a number of other goods and services, and therefore send core inflation higher, the risk may not be as significant as initially thought, according to Morgan Stanley.The firm's economics team points out that production cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia led WTI crude oil's price increase from $68 per barrel in June to $90 on Thursday. When the increase in oil prices comes from a supply shock, the impact on items included in core inflation calculations isn't nearly as severe, per Morgan Stanley. The firm sees a peak of a 0.05% impact on core CPI from rising energy costs before it falls in the next month.""Higher energy prices must be sustained for some time to have a greater, more durable effect on core prices,"" Zentner and the Morgan Stanley economics team wrote. ""The Fed will look through this shock.""Story continuesGas prices also drove higher-than-expected growth in August retail sales, which popped 0.6% from the month prior, above economists' expectations for 0.1%. Increases driven by gas usually lead to weaker goods spending in the long run if gas prices remain elevated, Goldman Sachs managing director Kate McShane told Yahoo Finance.It will take several months before the impact on the consumer will be fully felt though, according to EY chief economist Greg Daco.In a vacuum, Daco said the gas price increase isn't a ""game changer"" for the fight against inflation. But, he pointed out, it's another hit to the consumer as the case for a slowdown builds. The student loan moratorium ending on Oct.1 is expected to pressure the wallets of borrowers, while a looming United Auto Workers strike could halt vehicle production, hurting the labor market and sending car prices higher.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could help""Amid clearer signs that the labor market is losing momentum, rising gasoline prices putting pressure on real incomes again, and the additional drag from the resumption of student loan repayments, it is hard to see consumers spending as freely over the rest of the year,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note on Thursday. ""We expect a sharp slowdown in consumption growth, which will be the decisive factor tipping the economy into a mild recession over the coming quarters.""Gas prices on display at a petrol station in La Puente, California on September 7, 2023.

FE, PNM Resources, Inc. PNM, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Atmos Energy Corp. ATO and J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. JJSF.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Safe Stocks to Buy as Inflation Comes in Hotter than ExpectedOptimism over the Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate hikes in September has been soaring over the past few weeks but fresh inflation data released on Sep 13 might play spoilsport.According to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, the August inflation reading came in hotter than expected, raising fears that the Fed might continue with its monetary tightening campaign. Higher rates don’t bode well for the broader market. Given this scenario, investing in defensive sectors such as FirstEnergy Corp., PNM Resources, Inc., PepsiCo, Inc., Atmos Energy Corp. and J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. should be safe.Inflation Soars in AugustThe Labor Department reported on Wednesday that CPI increased 0.6% in August on a month-over-month basis, higher than the 0.2% rise in July. Year over year, CPI rose 3.7% in August, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.6%.The last time CPI increased more than 0.6% was in February 2022.Core CPI, which strips out the volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.3%, higher than the economists’ expectations of a rise of 0.2%. Year over year, core CPI, increased 4.3%, in line with expectations and 40 basis points down from July’s reading.However, core CPI still remains more than double the Fed’s target of 2%, which gives enough reasons to worry.The constant rise in oil prices played a major role in the sudden rise in inflation in August. Energy prices jumped 5.6% in August, while gasoline prices soared 10.6%. Food prices increased 0.2%.Story continuesRate Hike Fears ReigniteOil prices worldwide have been on the rise in recent times, primarily due to the decision of major oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend supply cuts until December 2023.Additionally, the improvement in China's manufacturing activity has contributed to the upward trend in oil prices. This is significant because China's economic growth is expected to lead to increased oil imports and a subsequent rise in demand for oil-related products.The surge in oil prices triggered inflation in August as higher oil prices led to elevated transportation costs, which subsequently affected the prices of essential goods and services. Higher oil prices saw airfares jump 4.9% in August.The Fed has already indicated that it is open to more interest rate hikes as inflation, despite sharply declining over the past year, remains elevated. And now the August inflation reading gives the central bank ample reasons to continue with its monetary tightening campaign.The Fed has already increased rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%. Needless to say, more interest rate hikes don’t bode well for the economy and the broader market. Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks would be a wise decision.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities. Also, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1).

And even if you do know what it is, you really don't know what it is.LLM is short for ""large language models,"" and they're about to bring fundamental change to the companies you own in your portfolio. And this change is likely to arrive faster than you or I — or the broader market — thinks.""Every business will get recreated with artificial intelligence,"" Salesforce co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff told me. ""Software engineering, which is a great example, is probably one of the areas that we're most surprised by — it's able to achieve new levels of efficiency with these AI tools. And there's going to be so many more industries as well.""My chat with Benioff came moments after his keynote speech at the annual Dreamforce conference, where he highlighted another new AI wave on the horizon: artificial general intelligence, which is a controversial science-fiction level of AI far past the current generative AI wave.I had no clue what this was before Dreamforce, but the sci-fi readers among you will. Basically, think RoboCop (for you '80s kids out there) and the Tesla bot that Elon Musk keeps on hyping. Robots that can actually think.Before the robots arrive, it was all smiles with Salesforce plush mascots at this year's AI-filled Dreamforce conference. (Yahoo Finance) (Brian Sozzi)Essentially, physical machines need an enormous amount of speed and processing power, and LLMs are the tool for the job.And as these beastly machines expand their power due to masters searching for fatter profits (RoboCop didn't need a pension), they will have profound impacts on businesses, industries, and markets.Story continuesTake for example my profession of choice, journalism.News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson told me at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference that AI will be ""epochal"" for news. He went on to warn that the industry could face a ""tsunami potentially of job losses"" due to the tech.Other execs at Dreamforce and the Goldman gathering told me they are concerned about AI bias and LLMs spitting out fake news. Both could invoke dreadful outcomes for society and business, these folks acknowledged.It's scary.Now, some of you will write me saying I am insane and have been breathing in too much AI hype for two weeks. Fair point, as I do miss the down-to-earth vibes in my home base of Long Island. But expect a big 2024 for tech companies playing meaningfully in the AI space.Think more AI-fueled guidance raises like we saw from Nvidia earlier this year as AI buying cycles get pulled forward. Wall Street analysts are clueless on how to model for this profit influx. I used to be in their seat and it's not their fault. We just haven't seen a looming demand curve such as the one we are on the cusp of witnessing with AI tools.That is no hype, it's very inevitable.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc.

Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

How does the CFO of Salesforce spend their time at an event like this?AMY WEAVER: Well, first it's spending time with our customers. You know, our customers are really here for our focus on AI. More than any other year, I think that there's a unified focus. And it's all about artificial intelligence. You know, the keynote today, we highlighted new AI throughout all of our products.

How does this change the financials of a company like Salesforce?AMY WEAVER: You know, it has the possibility to change every company and every company is financials. We're really at the beginning of the AI revolution. Right now, we're focused on how we can best serve our customers, how we can educate them, how we can really get them ready for what's coming with AI.BRIAN SOZZI: We've seen a lot of companies, I think, shock investors on how much business and book of business they're building from AI. How should investors think about the trajectory of your business in 2024?AMY WEAVER: You know, In FY '24, we just had a fantastic quarter. I'm sure you saw, we hit it out of the park, revenue, operating margin, cash flow. We were also able to raise on all of those points in our guidance. So we've raised our revenue for the year, raised our margin, raised our cash flow.Now, artificial intelligence, we're excited about that. But as I said on the earnings call, it's not part of our guide for this year. That's going to be more of a future event.BRIAN SOZZI: Of course, you sit on that McDonald's board of directors as well. What's your view on the economy heading into next year as seen through the prism from a company like that but also big tech budgets?AMY WEAVER: You know, it's really interesting for Salesforce. For about the last year, we have seen a more measured buying environment. And I think it's true across the tech industry. There have been elongated sales cycles, deal compression, additional approvals. And we're continuing to see that.But looking to the future, you can feel the buzz. You can feel the excitement. I think we've got good times ahead.BRIAN SOZZI: You had a-- I think it was you that made a really important point on the earnings call. And the earnings call just happened, just to be very clear. You said 30% operating margins are the floor for your business. Then what's the ceiling? I'm not trying-- I'm trying to get a little guidance. I mean, you are the CFO of Salesforce. I have to ask these things.AMY WEAVER: Well, going back, we've had incredible operating margin this year. For the second quarter in a row, we increased our operating margin more than 1,000 basis points year-on-year, pretty much unheard of for a company. I'm really excited about that. I was able to raise our guidance to 30% for the fiscal year, which is really a milestone amount for the company. And I have commented several times, I think 30%, we need to treat that as the floor, not the ceiling.BRIAN SOZZI: So how are you driving these operating margins? I know you've had to make some tough decisions on the business. Where are the biggest gains coming from?AMY WEAVER: Right now, the gains are coming primarily from the decisions we made last January. We made some tough, tough decisions around headcount, tough decisions about real estate. But we're also bringing a new discipline around spending. And you're seeing that pay off in our margins.BRIAN SOZZI: Is Salesforce being reborn? There's a different vibe to this conference. And I told my team back at home, I don't know what it is. I can't put my fingers on it. But how do you-- do you feel that? Do you see it?AMY WEAVER: I do. I do. Salesforce and Dreamforce, it has all the same energy, all the same excitement. But there's a new maturity. I think there's a maturity in our processes. There's a maturity in our product. There's a real sophistication in terms of what we're doing with AI. And I think you can feel our customers really leaning into that.BRIAN SOZZI: What has it been like leading Salesforce really through so much transformation of the past year? You've really dealt with situations that I have not experienced from someone who covers Salesforce, and you have not experienced-- the activists and headcount reductions. And what has it been like for you?AMY WEAVER: We have had quite a year, but I'm incredibly proud of the company. Our employees have risen to the occasion. They have rallied. And there is not one person at the company who has not been involved in this transformation and bringing us through this.BRIAN SOZZI: Marc and I, CEO Marc Benioff, co-founder chairman, we talked about boomerang employees. People coming that were used to work at Salesforce, they left for whatever reason, they're coming back to your company to, I guess, drive this AI revolution. How important have those employees been to this rebirth we're seeing here?AMY WEAVER: You know, we've had some incredible boomerang employees. Steve Fisher is a terrific example. He left back in 2014, went off to eBay, other experiences. He's comeback, has been really instrumental in terms of our engineering and our artificial intelligence.We've had many others come back. And what I love is they know the company, and yet they've had this outside experience. And it brings it all together, they hit the ground running. But I also want to give credit to our employees who have been here throughout. They are the engine at Salesforce. And they have brought us through this year.BRIAN SOZZI: Before I let you go, you know, I mentioned to Marc, too, that all this AI, I would imagine you have to retrain workforces around the country to learn a lot of these new products. But I think it also starts in the schools. I was thinking back, I learned really no computers, no computer skills in school whatsoever. I think I started working on the Commodore, like, which is just wild, like playing Pac-Man or some weird game. But how are people going to get the skills to put some of these new AI applications to work?AMY WEAVER: Well, I think it's a perfect question. Salesforce is incredibly dedicated to public education. Probably the most fun thing I have done at Salesforce-- sorry, at Dreamforce is I went across the city yesterday to George Washington High School, where we announced another $20 million donation from Salesforce to public schools. And in this case, it was particularly for artificial intelligence. How do we get the technology, how do we get the in and the hands of our students?And you're right, this is not something that we've dealt with before. But we need this. And it's not entirely altruistic from Salesforce. These are our future employees. We need these students to have the best skills, the best technology, and the best future.BRIAN SOZZI: So this money that you unveiled, these children are going to learn how to code, how to use AI?AMY WEAVER: Absolutely. And this was just a small part of the investment. Over the years, we've given $72 million to the San Francisco Unified School Board, $52 million to Oakland, and more around the world. But today, really focusing on that AI.And one thing that was really fun. We had the George Washington High School Robotics Club here for the keynote. They are going around now. They are hitting all the booths. They're hitting the different sessions. They are just going to be cutting-edge. And about half of them were girls, and I was particularly thrilled to see that.BRIAN SOZZI: That is really cool to see. I'll let you go. I know this is Dreamforce is your event. You're a very high demand. I also know you don't do a lot of interviews. So thank you for coming on Yahoo Finance. We greatly appreciate your time.AMY WEAVER: It was a pleasure. Thank you.BRIAN SOZZI: Amy Weaver, Salesforce CFO, we'll talk to you soon.]"

Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi sat down with Slack CEO Lidiane Jones to talk AI and the ""productivity revolution."" Jones explains how Slack is using AI to help users automate tasks and increase productivity and cut down on busy work.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRIAN SOZZI: Yahoo Finance still stationed in Dreamforce in San Francisco. And I'm here with the message, and that is the future of work is not in the future. It is right now playing out at Slack, which, of course, is owned by Salesforce. Let's bring in Lidiane Jones, the Slack CEO. Good to see you in person for a change.LIDIANE JONES: It's amazing to see you, Brian. Thank you for being here.BRIAN SOZZI: This is-- there's been a lot of AI here and a lot of AI being talked about, of course, with Slack. What should users of your platform know about it right now?LIDIANE JONES: Well, you started well. The future of work is right here, and AI is transforming the way we work. And it's been amazing for us at Slack. This is the moment that we've been working towards. The future of AI is a [? productivity ?] revolution, the AI revolution. So we're really excited to not only bring what's already natural for Slack-- conversational interface-- but all of that data that sits in Slack makes us so powerful to be the entry door, the platform that brings AI productivity to life, so I'm really thrilled about that.BRIAN SOZZI: So what are some of the new features, AI-related, that power users of the platform, like-- like the Yahoo Finance newsroom, should be on the lookout for?LIDIANE JONES: Well, there's some really exciting capabilities that we announced last week. With Slack AI, you can do amazing things like catch up on all of the channels that you've been, I'm sure--BRIAN SOZZI: I can't keep track. Let's take this offline.LIDIANE JONES: We're going to summarize threads. But also a lock search, which has all of an organizational knowledge, right? All of your team's conversation, the content, records, you can now, in a generative-based search tool, unlock all of that. So we can't wait to get it to our customers later this fall.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Is AI going to make it easier, looking through the lens of Slack, to handle all these meetings? I'm in meetings all the time. Are you helping to figure that out, how to make it easier?LIDIANE JONES: Well, I think, you know, one of our biggest innovation announcements has been to unlock our AI-powered platform that unlocks our workflow building for business users. So our belief is that if people automate-- end users are powered to automate a lot of their tasks, there will be a lot less meetings. Certainly here at Salesforce, once we unlocked workflow building, we reduced meetings by nearly 30%. So we can't wait to get our customers unlocking automation too.BRIAN SOZZI: Please unlock that for me.LIDIANE JONES: I need to spend time with you.BRIAN SOZZI: Please just turn the key in that lock. No more meetings, please. So you must get this question a lot. People know that you work-- you're the CEO of Slack. Do these platforms make you less productive? Now, we have all these bots, all these new assistants popping up on this platform. How do I get my work done?LIDIANE JONES: Well, you know, the power of it is when you're using AI for real productivity, for getting the job done. So I think that the key is unlocking integrations that are based on business use cases. That's why we're really excited about our integrations that we announced this week with Sales Elevate for Salesforce. So it has to be very purposeful, Brian, and that really is productivity, not busy work.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us, because I think in the early days of the integration when Salesforce bought Slack, there was this concern that there's this wall between the companies. Does that exist, and what does that interaction between that core Salesforce platform and Slack look like?LIDIANE JONES: Well, Brian, you're seeing it firsthand at this Dreamforce. We unveiled a next generation of integration. With Slack Sales Elevate, we're building native line of business experiences right within Slack following the Slack experience model. It's been really transformative for our customers to be able to accelerate the power of Salesforce and Slack like never to get-- never seen before. So we're really excited to get that to our customers.BRIAN SOZZI: So many offices are going back. So many people are back in their offices. I really became a true power user of Slack, it was during the pandemic. What are you seeing from your customers now?LIDIANE JONES: Well, we're seeing that customers are much more in a hybrid world than ever before and seeing also that there's a lot of intentionality about how to use in-person time. So a lot of our customers, including ourselves, are focusing on activities that really drive purpose for in-person use, like learning and onboarding and so forth. And using Slack to continue that relationship that employees build in person-- so in person and on remote, we can really help that navigation of our customers.BRIAN SOZZI: Thinking back to the early days of Slack, I know your business always gave great insight into of health of small businesses in this country. What are you hearing from them? What challenges are they up against looking into next year?LIDIANE JONES: Well, what we're seeing is that companies are still starting on Slack. We're still seeing a lot of smaller companies coming to Slack.com to get started in their collaboration. That has not changed, and it gives me a lot of optimism, Brian, that there is another, you know, surge in small companies starting again. I'm seeing a positive trend on that direction.BRIAN SOZZI: Is the battle between Slack and Teams real? Do you wake up in the morning saying, you know, I'm tired of Teams. I can't stand them.LIDIANE JONES: I wake up every morning thinking about how I can help our customers. And what we're doing is so differentiated because we're really building a productivity platform that connects people and systems such as [INAUDIBLE] work. I think that is unique and something that our customers are excited about as well.BRIAN SOZZI: A lot of, I think, Salesforce investors that I've talked to are excited about you and your product background. How did you get into the seat, and what's next for you?LIDIANE JONES: Well, thank you for saying that. You know, what got me here is my passion for building products that our customers love. And I think this is-- not only is Slack an incredible platform, but being part of Salesforce unlocks an opportunity that has not existed in the market. So I feel incredibly fortunate to be here.BRIAN SOZZI: This AI revolution-- that's what Marc called it-- of course, Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce. AI revolution, I think it's going to create the need to reskill workers. Do you agree with that?LIDIANE JONES: Yeah, you know, this AI revolution for us is also a productivity revolution. And that means that productivity for employees means figuring out the right skills to do the job that they need. So at Salesforce and its lab, we're really committed to expanding our own learning capabilities to help the workforce come along an AI journey because the work will shift. We want to make sure employees are ready for that.BRIAN SOZZI: Biggest challenges-- I'm putting this to really everybody that I talk to at Dreamforce. I'll put it to you. Biggest challenges you're up against as a leader looking out over the next year?LIDIANE JONES: Well, certainly going through change management, you know? There's a lot of change happening in the market. You mentioned a few today-- you know, return to work, AI revolution, there's a lot happening. So we're really focused on how do we help not only our customers, our employees be excited about this next generation of innovation but that they're also ready for it.BRIAN SOZZI: Before I let you go, best Slack hack that I need to know about.LIDIANE JONES: You have to use Clips. Clips and Huddles can help you communicate effectively from wherever you are.BRIAN SOZZI: I know how to use Huddles. I don't-- it bothers me I don't know what Clips is.LIDIANE JONES: OK, see, we [INAUDIBLE].BRIAN SOZZI: It's really not good. We need to connect offline. Again, Slack CEO, Lidiane Jones. Good to see you in person. Thanks for having us at Dreamforce. It's been a real fascinating event. Lots of AI talk. Really mind-blowing stuff.LIDIANE JONES: Thank you for having me.BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you so much.]"

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who once was a leading voice to close the plant, said last year that Diablo Canyon’s power is needed beyond 2025 to ward off possible blackouts as California transitions to solar and other renewable energy sources.Friends of the Earth, a longtime critic of plant safety, was a central player in negotiating the 2016 closing agreement. The filing comes just weeks after a state judge rejected a lawsuit filed by the group that sought to block PG&amp;E — the state’s largest utility — from seeking to extend the plant's operating life.The petition, filed Thursday in Washington, was accompanied by a 46-page report by Digby Macdonald, a University of California, Berkeley, professor in nuclear engineering and materials science, who wrote that continued operation of the Unit 1 reactor “poses an unreasonable risk to public health and safety due to serious indications of an unacceptable degree of embrittlement.”“The reactor should be closed until PG&amp;E obtains and analyzes additional data regarding its condition,” wrote Macdonald, who was retained by the environmental groups.The petition asks the NRC to convene a hearing to review a 2003 decision by agency staff to extend the testing schedule for the Unit 1 pressure vessel until 2025. According to the groups, the last inspections on the vessel took place between 2003 and 2005. The utility postponed further testing in favor of using results from similar reactors to justify continued operations, they said.In his report, Macdonald concludes PG&amp;E should have accelerated its testing schedule, not delayed it, to assess possible defects. He noted that unlike most other reactor safety components, the pressure vessel has no independent backup system that can be called upon if it should crack or fracture and lose essential cooling water.He added that obtaining more testing data on Unit 1 is especially important because its steel has excessive copper and nickel content ""that render it more vulnerable to embrittlement.”The “NRC currently lacks an adequate basis to conclude that Diablo Canyon Unit 1 can be operated safely,” Macdonald said.Construction at Diablo Canyon began in the 1960s. Critics have long argued that potential shaking from nearby earthquake faults not recognized when the design was approved could damage equipment and release radiation. One nearby fault was not discovered until 2008. The groups argue that the embrittlement assessment is even more critical, given the plant's seismic vulnerabilities.PG&amp;E has maintained the plant is safe, an assessment endorsed by the NRC.California is the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and for decades has had a fraught relationship with nuclear power, which doesn’t produce carbon pollution like fossil fuels but leaves behind waste that can remain dangerously radioactive for centuries. The Newsom administration is pushing to expand solar power and other clean energy as the state aims to cut emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature agreed last year to open the way for a longer operating run at the plant, essentially unwinding the 2016 agreement to close the plant.However, it’s not yet clear if the reactors will continue operating beyond the expiration of their federal operating licenses — 2024 for Unit 1, and 2025 for Unit 2 — since many regulatory milestones and unanswered questions remain.The utility has said it plans to file for license extensions with the NRC by the end of the year.According to the NRC, embrittlement occurs as a result of reactor operation when neutrons from the nuclear fuel irradiate the steel plates and welds used to construct the reactor vessel. The irradiation embrittles the steel, making it less tough.]"

Though the company emerged from bankruptcy in 2020, the bankruptcy court is still handling claims, including 8,000 individual shareholder claims against the company.A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals questioned the need for those claims to be heard before investors can sue PG&amp;E's officers and directors, who are not debtors in the bankruptcy.U.S. Circuit Court Judge Danielle Forrest called the stay ""a little puzzling.""""What is the efficiency that we are even gaining here? Other than the district court doesn't have to do any work right now,"" she said.Attorney Stephen Blake, arguing for the directors and officers, said the stay would help avoid inconsistent rulings between the bankruptcy court and the district court.Carol Villegas, an attorney for the shareholders, many of whom have not pursued claims against PG&amp;E in the bankruptcy, said the class claims are worth billions of dollars and insurance proceeds that could cover damages have dwindled.Liability claims related to wildfires have caused substantial financial burden on the company, but it reported a rise in second-quarter profit largely driven by lower legal costs in June.The case is Public Employees Retirement Ass'n of New Mexico et al. v. Earley et al., No. 22-16711, in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.(Reporting by Jody Godoy; Editing by Leslie Adler)]"

That's the reason September's National Preparedness Month exists, and that's why Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) teamed up with the Placer Hills Fire Department to put one local family to the test.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)In this video, released in 2021 and just as relevant today, a Sierra foothills family is put through a simulated wildfire evacuation to demonstrate how being prepared can help bring calm to the chaos.""You think you're ready, but are you? It's scary,"" said Michelle Childers, who participated in the disaster readiness drill with her husband Justin and their two children.PG&amp;E urges all our customers to assess how prepared your family, home and community are for a natural disaster or other emergency, and to take the necessary actions to be ready.In addition to the video, PG&amp;E's Safety Action Center website puts valuable resources at your fingertips. You can:Take a quiz to find out if you know what to pack in an emergency kitLearn how to prepare a kit with six easy stepsCreate an emergency planLearn how to create defensible space around your homeWatch a special video series: 7 Saturdays to a more fire resistant homeAn 'Eye-Opening' ExperienceFor the Childers family, firefighters gave them just 10 minutes to get what they would need, as is often the case in a real evacuation, and leave their home.""My first instinct was birth certificates, passports, IDs, keys, wallets, because those are the things we're going to need immediately (if evacuated) to get a hotel, to rebuild. My second initial response was mementos, pictures,"" said Justin.Story continues""I've never experienced this, I know what I was thinking, but I paused,"" said Michelle, describing the first seconds after the knock at the door. ""I got a couple of changes of clothes for each of us, got some snacks that I know the kids would eat, and some mementos.""Although the family did not have go-bags ready during the drill, they grabbed essentials: important documents, changes of clothes and some food.""I thought they did a really good job,"" said Battalion Chief Matt Slusher with the Placer Hills Fire Department. ""They worked well together. But what if one of you was not home at the time of an evacuation? What would you prioritize? For example, the kids—if you had to be away for 72 hours, their homework, the things that are important to them because their lives are going to be turned upside down, how do you maintain a level of normalcy?""""I was motionless,"" said Michelle, who is an elementary school teacher. ""You need to have a go-bag, container with food and water for 72 hours. This was eye-opening.""""This life-like emergency drill was a great reminder for all of us to plan what we would do before any kind of natural disaster or other emergency, and to practice how we would respond. It's muscle memory. You have to practice it to perfect it,"" said Joe Wilson, PG&amp;E's Vice President, North Valley &amp; Sierra Region.How Customers Can PrepareHere are some simple guidelines to prepare for an emergency.Build or restock your emergency kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, first-aid supplies and cash. Keep face masks and hand sanitizer in your emergency kit.Identify backup charging methods for phones and keep printed copies of emergency numbers.Plan for medical needs like medications that require refrigeration or devices that need power.Keep in mind family members who are elderly, younger children and pets.Update your contact information online or by calling PG&amp;E at 1-866-743-6589 during normal business hours so you can receive Public Safety Power Shutoff alerts.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

83,3b7487c9-2efb-3ab3-b87c-7d29f6fc318d,MRO,2023-09-15,Keep an Eye on 3 Oil Explorers as Crude Prices Surge Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keep-eye-3-oil-explorers-141500533.html,1694700900,STORY,"['EOG', 'MRO', 'CL=F', 'MTDR']","[Oil prices continue to be advantageous for upstream enterprises despite the challenges posed by fluctuations and uncertainties in the energy market. After a period of underperformance for most of this year, the energy sector is experiencing a robust resurgence due to a hike in oil prices.The West Texas Intermediate crude oil price is presently hovering at $89 per barrel, while the Asian benchmark, Brent crude, has surged above $90 per barrel. This marks the first time it has reached such levels since last November.Reasons Behind Oil Price SurgeThe recent surge in oil prices was primarily driven by a tightening oil market. This resulted from a combination of increased crude oil demand and significant supply cuts implemented by key OPEC+ members, namely Saudi Arabia and Russia.Saudi Arabia expressed its willingness to extend its voluntary production reduction of 1 million barrels per day for an additional three months, continuing this measure until the end of the current year. Similarly, Russia is willing to curb its oil exports by 300,000 barrels a day until the end of December 2023.Relatively sluggish economic growth in China over the past year had a negative impact on global oil prices. However, the unexpected increase in manufacturing activity in August, coming from the world's largest oil importer, also contributed to the rise in oil prices.3 Stocks to GainShares of oil companies are also gaining. Considering the current elevated oil prices, we have identified three upstream stocks with upward-trending earnings revisions.EOG Resources, Inc. EOG possesses substantial acreage in prominent oil shale regions, such as the Permian and Eagle Ford. EOG's extensive presence in these critical shale resources is expected to support its long-term production expansion. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the company maintains a portfolio of more than a decade's worth of high-quality inventory, boasting a 60% rate of economic return.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In 2023, EOG Resources expects to attain a total production of 965-991.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), marking an increase from the 908.2 MBoe/d achieved in the prior year. We anticipate a year-over-year growth rate of 7.1% in this parameter. As a result, with heightened production in a highly favorable crude oil pricing environment, the company's profitability stands to gain.Matador Resources Company MTDR maintains a robust presence in the oil-rich core regions of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays within the Delaware Basin. Since 2011, this Zacks Rank #3 company has significantly expanded its holdings in the Delaware Basin. Starting with 6,700 net acres in 2011, the company's operations now encompass 124,800 net acres in the Delaware Basin.The favorable crude oil price environment is expected to assist Matador in boosting its production volumes. For 2023, Matador expects its oil equivalent production to be 45.8-47.5 million barrels. This forecast indicates an enhancement from the 38.5 million oil equivalent barrels recorded in 2022. Matador's primary objectives for the year include reducing debt levels, generating free cash flows, and either maintaining or increasing dividends.Marathon Oil Corporation MRO holds an impressive inventory of North American unconventional resources that can sustain its operations for approximately 10 years, with a breakeven cost of less than $40 per barrel. This inventory extends to nearly 20 years if the breakeven points fall within $40-$50. In essence, Marathon's well-drilling activities are characterized by exceptionally low breakeven costs, requiring oil prices as low as $35 per barrel to remain profitable.The upstream energy company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, anticipates significant production growth this year. Based on our assessment, our production outlook closely aligns with the company's guidance. We project a 16.5% increase in production for the year 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The company operates approximately 2,800 stores primarily under the name brands of Kay Jewelers, Zales, Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry, H.Samuel, Ernest Jones, Peoples, Piercing Pagoda, and JamesAllen.com.The insider's recent sell-off raises questions about the company's current valuation and future prospects. Let's delve into the details.Insider Sell: CEO Virginia Drosos Sells 10,000 Shares of Signet Jewelers LtdThe insider transaction history for Signet Jewelers Ltd shows a clear trend of selling. Over the past year, there have been 32 insider sells and no insider buys. This could be a red flag for potential investors, as it suggests that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company are choosing to reduce their holdings.On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Signet Jewelers Ltd were trading for $74.84 apiece, giving the company a market cap of $3.43 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 8.69, lower than both the industry median of 16.72 and the companys historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that, despite the insider selling, the stock may still be undervalued compared to its peers and its own historical standards.Insider Sell: CEO Virginia Drosos Sells 10,000 Shares of Signet Jewelers LtdHowever, the GuruFocus Value, an intrinsic value estimate based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, paints a slightly different picture. With a price of $74.84 and a GuruFocus Value of $68.23, Signet Jewelers Ltd has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.1. This indicates that the stock is modestly overvalued.In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell-off and the overall trend of insider selling at Signet Jewelers Ltd may raise some concerns, the company's relatively low price-earnings ratio suggests that the stock may still offer value. However, the GuruFocus Value indicates that the stock is modestly overvalued, suggesting that potential investors should proceed with caution.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Prices on nearly 200 medications will be cut by an average of 40%, and many can be bought for under $15 for a 30-day fill.If you're one of the many Americans struggling to afford prescription medication, GoodRx's deal with Walgreens could help you save the next time you're at the pharmacy.Prices on nearly 200 prescription medications will now be discounted by an average of 40%, and many prescriptions can now be purchased for less than $15 for a 30-day fill, without any deductibles, restrictions, paperwork, approvals or quantity limitations. Though GoodRX has been partnered with Walgreens for more than a decade, this limited-time offer provides even further savings for millions of customers across Walgreen's 9,000 retail locations. Medications for a number of health concerns, even those not typically covered by insurance, will be discounted. This includes medications for not only heart disease and mental health, but also acne and insomnia. Here’s a look at how much a GoodRX coupon could save you at Walgreens on popular medications.GoodRX list of medication discounts.“Americans shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to be able to afford their medications,” said Jim Sheninger, Pharmacy Strategy Officer of GoodRx in a press release. “Walgreens has been part of our network since nearly the beginning, enabling us to offer their customers lower prices on the most commonly prescribed medications to make it even easier for people to save money. We believe everyone deserves affordable healthcare, and this initiative will help more Americans access the treatment they need.”In a study from 2021, the CDC found that 8.2% of adults (ages 18–64) who took prescription medication in the past 12 months reported not taking medication as prescribed due to cost. And prescription medication is only becoming more expensive. “There were 1,216 products whose price increases during the twelve-month period from July 2021 to July 2022 exceeded the inflation rate of 8.5 percent for that time period,"" reported the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) last year. “The average price increase for these drugs was 31.6 percent.”Story continuesFurther, in a poll published by YouGov earlier this year, more than one-third of Americans reported that they’ve had to forgo filling a prescription medication due to the cost. For this reason, saving on prescription medication has becoming increasingly important.Related ContentHow to Save on Prescription MedicationMedicare Lists First 10 Drugs for Talks On Lowering Your CostsWalgreens Expands Healthcare Reach With New PartnershipAmazon launches RxPass — its new subscription service for medication]"

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Paychex basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Paychex imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for PaychexFor the fiscal year ending May 2024, this payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to earn $4.68 per share, which is a change of 9.6% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Paychex. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Paychex to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc.

Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

100,cb703c96-e1aa-3e22-b9d0-30a42e1db78b,SBUX,2023-09-15,"Citing sustainability, Starbucks wants to overhaul its iconic cup. Will customers go along?",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citing-sustainability-starbucks-wants-overhaul-052750304.html,1694755670,STORY,['SBUX'],"[TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Bethany Patton steps up to the counter and places her pink mug into a shoebox-sized dishwasher. It spins. It whirs. Water splashes inside. After 90 seconds, the door opens and steam emerges. A barista grabs the mug, dries it and prepares Patton’s order — a 16-ounce Starbucks double espresso on ice.For bringing her own cup, Patton gets $1 off her drink.“Saving the environment is important and all, but I probably come here more in knowing that I’m going to get a dollar off,” says Patton, 27, a cancer researcher at Arizona State University. Two friends who came on the afternoon coffee run nod in assent as they hold the cups that they, too, brought along.Just as noteworthy as what they’re carrying is what they are not: the disposable Starbucks cup, an icon in a world where the word is overused.For a generation and more, it has been a cornerstone of consumer society, first in the United States and then globally — the throwaway cup with the emerald logo depicting a longhaired siren with locks like ocean waves. Ubiquitous to the point of being an accessory, it has carried a message: I am drinking coffee from the world's most recognizable coffee company.Now, in an era where concern for the environment and sustainability can be good business, the Starbucks disposable cup may be on its way to extinction thanks to an unlikely force: Starbucks itself.By 2030, Starbucks wants to move away completely from disposable cups, which represent big portions of the company’s overall waste and greenhouse gas emissions.The stated reason is that it’s the right thing to do for the environment, and Starbucks has a long history of lofty sustainability goals around many aspects of their global operations. Some have been met, such as new stores being certified for energy efficiency, while others have been scrapped or revised along the way. For example, in 2008 the company said that by 2015 it wanted 100% of its cups to be recyclable or reusable, which it’s far from achieving even today.Story continuesToday’s drive to completely overhaul the cup arguably comes with a business imperative, as extreme weather events and other manifestations of climate change make waste like disposable cups more notable, and by extension increased expectations from customers for the company to be part of the solution.At the Arizona State location where Patton gets her coffee, Starbucks already doesn’t serve any coffee in disposable paper or plastic cups. Customers who don’t bring their own are given a reusable plastic one that can be dropped off in bins around campus. It’s one of two dozen pilots over the last two years, all aimed at fundamentally changing how the world’s largest coffee maker serves its java.The goal: to cut the company’s waste, water use and carbon emissions in half by 2030. Pulling that off will be tricky, is fraught with risks and provides a window into what companies must do to go from ambitious sustainability targets to meeting those goals.“Our vision for the cup of the future — and our Holy Grail, if you will — is that the cup still has the iconic symbol on it,” says Michael Kobori, head of sustainability at Starbucks. “It’s just as a reusable cup.”Starbucks is not the first company to push toward a reusable cup.But as the largest coffee company in the world, with more than 37,000 stores in 86 countries and revenues of $32 billion last year, Starbucks could force change across the industry.Overhauling how coffee is served means doing two major things in parallel that are seemingly in conflict: Move toward only reusable cups while developing disposable cups that use less material and are more recyclable.At the Arizona State store, if customers don’t bring their own cup, they are given a reusable plastic one with a Starbucks logo. If they bring it back, they get $1 off, just like customers who bring their own. And if they don’t want to hold onto it? There are bins around campus, and the cups are washed by the university — part of a partnership with Starbucks — and returned to the store.For several years, Starbucks has been increasing the amount of recycled material in disposable paper cups. In some markets last year, Starbucks began using single-use paper cups made with 30% recycled material, an increase from 10%. The plan is to have all cups at 30% recycled material in the U.S. starting in early 2025.A similar testing and refining process is happening with disposable plastic cups used for cold drinks. At an innovation lab in Starbucks’ Seattle headquarters, drinks with ice in plastic cups are placed in holders attached to a platform. It then shakes as technicians look for leaks and flaws.By the end of 2023, the goal is to reduce by 15% the amount of material in each cup. To do that, technicians examine different parts of the cup to see where less material may be used without weakening the cup.Then, “if it passes tests with baristas, then we would put it in the stores,” says Kyle Walker, a packaging engineer on Starbucks’ research and development team.Eventually, the goal is to get rid of single-use cups. That’s because no matter the tests or technological innovations, there are limits to how much waste can be reduced with disposable paper and plastic cups. Long-term reductions in waste will come from reusable cups.The company has a long way to go. Since the reintroduction of reusable cups in some stores in July 2021 — reusable cups were not used during much of the pandemic — only 1.2% of worldwide sales in fiscal year 2022 came from reusables. Starbucks wouldn’t provide data on how many disposable cups they use or the costs.Valencia Villanueva, a barista at the Arizona State store, has noted a growing level of consciousness among customers about the cup-washing machine on the counter and the “borrowed” cup program. That gives her confidence that reusable cups are the future.“Nobody,” she says, “has complained and said they wanted a single-use cup.”___Peter Prengaman is news director of The Associated Press’ climate and environment team and can be followed here.

102,8723fc7b-ed63-3364-a252-d1e6dac6bc81,SBUX,2023-09-15,The future of Starbucks without Howard Schultz,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/future-starbucks-without-howard-schultz-164841743.html,1694710121,VIDEO,['SBUX'],"[Howard Shultz, founder and ex-CEO of Starbucks (SBUX), has announced his retirement from the coffee chain's board of directors. Concurrently, former Alibaba executive Wei Zhang has been elected to take his place. Shultz's departure will allow for current CEO Laxman Narasimhan to effectively take the reins as top company leadership, according to a note from Bernstein. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma discusses Schultz's role in growing the company and how Zhang’s addition could benefit Starbucks’ plans for global expansion.Video TranscriptBROOKE DIPALMA: Many [? analysts ?] in the street, not too surprised. They just said this was a planned succession as Howard Schultz set his eyes on retirement. But one analyst is saying that they were a bit disappointed as Schultz seemed to have that magic he brings to the Starbucks brand.Analysts are saying that they expect little to no impact to fundamentals in the near or medium term largely because the company is already making way on that reinvention plan that they introduced this exact time last year. And that's being executed by the leadership team that Howard Schultz largely picked.Some new executives on the board include Frank Britt. We also have the new CEO that took the helm in late March, was intended to be early April, Laxman Narasimhan. And part of that reinvestment plan is that they expect same-store sales to grow between the range of 7% to 9% generally.Now, [? Bernstein ?] did come out with a note this morning saying a few potential implications in what investors can expect from here. They said that CEO Laxman Narasimhan now has control, of course. We've seen in the past that when Howard Schultz stayed on the board, he has a large say, a heavy hand, perhaps, when it comes to laying out plans or future targets for Starbucks.Now Laxman fully has control of the company. And we know that Schultz had made an interesting play when it comes to the workforce at Starbucks. An interesting relationship there Schultz was accused earlier this year of aggressive and illegal Union busting. He did testify on the Hill right after he stepped down as CEO. And so that analysts are expecting that Starbucks will gain more credibility with their workforce.Story continuesAnd the last note here, the person that is stepping in, Wei Zhang, is a former Alibaba executive. And so this is a recommitment of Starbucks investment in China. Of course, she led their Alibaba group's international business and media strategy. And for six years there, she also led out of Beijing corporate development, corporate strategy, and social responsibility. And so an interesting pick here by Starbucks. But really, making headway in China. And so perhaps, the right time to bring in someone with this sort of expertise.JULIE HYMAN: And so how does that play into the bigger global expansion-- not just China, but overall?BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. Well, Starbucks does have 20,000 stores now beyond North America. And so it'll be interesting to see the way that Wei comes in and really says [INAUDIBLE]. But also, Laxman coming from a UK business Rekkit, it'll be interesting to see the way that he now has a bigger voice in the company.And Starbucks has been making headway into China. We know that as of September of last year, they opened 6,000 stores. And with this reinvention plan, the company now expects to grow by 50% in China and reach 9,000 stores in the next year. As I just mentioned before, they also have 20,000 stores outside of North America.And they're learning a lot from China. I think it's been interesting to watch the company tackle, of course. They stepped in during COVID. They said that we are a leader in the West. We're looking to make headway into China. And they were one of the companies that really built up during COVID, expecting that when the lockdowns opened, they would see a return in last quarter. We did see that big return.JULIE HYMAN: It's happening in China. But yeah, not as much as it was anticipated. Thank you, Brooke. Appreciate it.]"

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Sysco shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Sysco is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Food - Miscellaneous industry that ranks in the Bottom 38% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Synopsys (SNPS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SNPS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Synopsys' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Synopsys' main business drivers.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. The company offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks. It also sells physical synthesis and physical design products as well as physical verification products.The company’s products are used to design a chip, from concept to the point of delivery to the manufacturer for fabrication. Synopsis provides software and hardware, which are used to develop electronic systems that incorporate chips. Additionally, the company provides Intellectual Property (IP) used in semiconductor design and manufacturing to simplify the design process and accelerate time-to-market for its customers.Synopsis reports revenues in three segments, namely Time-Based Products, Upfront Products and Maintenance and Service.Time-Based Products (59% of fiscal 2022 revenues): Segment revenues are recognized as Technology Subscription License (TSL) revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from fees over the period of the license or as and when the installments are paid by the customer, whichever is later.Upfront Products (24%): These revenues are recognized as Term License revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from term licenses in full after the completion of the shipment of the software, wherein at least 75% of the license fee is paid within a year of shipment, after fulfilling all other revenue recognition criteria.Maintenance and Service (17%): Under this segment revenues come from maintenance fees that are generated over the maintenance period; along with revenues generated from professional service and training fees.The company conducts its business across four geographic regions namely: North America (47% of fiscal 2022 revenues), China (16%), Europe (10%), Korea (10%) and others (17%).Synopsys’ competitors include EDA vendors like Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Synopsys ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in September 2013 would be worth $12,479.55, or a 1,147.96% gain, as of September 14, 2023.

Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc.

PM is focused on enhancing shareholders’ returns. The leading international tobacco company hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 2.4%. This takes the annualized rate to $5.20 per share.The company will pay a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share, up from the previous rate of $1.27 per share. The hiked dividend will be payable on Oct 12, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Sep 27.Philip Morris currently has a dividend payout of 86%, a dividend yield of 5.4% and a free cash flow yield of 5%. With an annual free cash flow return on investment of 18.7%, the increased dividend is likely to be sustainable. Dividend payouts are one of the biggest enticements for investors and Philip Morris is committed to boosting shareholders’ value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else Should You Know?Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has aided its revenues and adjusted operating income even in the face of the unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the second quarter of 2023.Serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products (RRPs). The company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 35.4% of the company’s net revenues in the second quarter of 2023. The company is well placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have inched up 1.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 0.6%.Story continuesLooking for Solid Consumer Staple Stocks?

WU’s shares lost 2.8% on Sep 13, replicating declines in broader markets.Elektra also remains the leading non-bank cash advance service provider in the United States. Thanks to the latest partnership, Western Union users in Mexico with an active account at Banco Azteca, which is owned by Elektra, can seamlessly receive money sent from the United States into their accounts by simply sending a message through Chatbot.A Chatbot is an artificial intelligence feature that allows businesses to personally communicate with customers via the Internet, freeing them from the expense of hiring human representatives. The tool remains embedded and can be utilized in any major messaging app.In order to avail benefits of the new digital capability, Western Union users initially need to save the Banco Azteca App and the name of the Chatbot as ""My money transfer"" in their mobile phones.Subsequently, in order to initiate a conversation from WhatsApp, a text needs to be sent via Chatbot from the telephone number registered with the Banco Azteca account. The transaction number and amount are then needed to be confirmed, following which the money gets deposited in near real-time to the beneficiary account. Ensuring increased transparency, the money transfer receipt will be shared through Chatbot and email.The latest partnership demonstrates Western Union’s intensified focus on establishing a solid footprint as a leading money transfer service provider across Mexico. Increased utilization of WU’s money transfer services is expected to boost its money transfer revenues, a significant contributor to its top line.Western Union already boasts a widespread network of retail locations in the country and its recent move to make technology investments for greater convenience, comfort and flexibility can only add strength to its nationwide presence. Elektra, an innovative technology solutions provider, seems to be the apt partner for complementing WU’s endeavor.Story continuesThe facility of making money transfers possible with the help of mobile phones across a country like Mexico, a significant part of whose population holds an active WhatsApp account, seems to be a time-opportune move on the part of Western Union. The country remains a hot spot for substantial electronic transfers, owing to widespread digital adoption and a rising number of Internet users.This year, Western Union also expanded its money transfer services across Mexico, available at 332 branch locations of Fundacion Donde and 1,800-plus locations of the leading retail chain, 7-Eleven Mexico.Shares of Western Union have gained 17.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 13.6% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research WU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are Payoneer Global Inc.

However, COVID-led supply-chain disruption might hurt the earnings of the industry players. Also, rising Fed rates tend to put pressure on airlines, which, in turn, may hurt aerospace-defense equipment stocks.Nevertheless, total airline revenues are expected to recover to around 93% of the 2019 figure, as predicted by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This bolsters the growth prospects of aerospace-defense equipment stocks, especially those involved in commercial aerospace. Some key players in this industry that you may keep in your portfolio are TransDigm Group, Bae Systems and FTAI Aviation.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry comprises firms that manufacture various vital components for the aerospace-defense space, ranging from aerostructures, space shuttles, propulsion systems, aircraft engines, defense electronics, missile and radar systems to flight test equipment, structural adhesives, instrumentation and control systems, communication products and many more.Some of these companies also offer integrated simulation and training services to the U.S. defense force. While majority of the revenues are generated from the production of the aforementioned accompaniments, the industry players also generate revenues by providing notable aftermarket support and services like maintenance, repair and overhaul activities to aerospace and defense players.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense Equipment IndustryNew M&amp;As Instill Hopes: Rising competition has historically prompted industry majors to expand their product lines through small and medium-sized mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) apart from the big mergers in the industry. In August 2023, BAES Systems signed an agreement to acquire Ball Aerospace for $5.55 billion. Ball Aerospace’s proven expertise in spacecraft, mission payloads, optical systems, conformal antennas and electronically steered arrays should further bolster BAE Systems’ position in the defense space.Story continuesEarlier, in May 2023, Heico Corp. declared its intent to acquire Wencor Group. Wencor Group, which boasts a strong portfolio of products in the aftermarket space and serves varied airlines worldwide, aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul companies, military agencies and defense contractors. The acquisition will thus provide HEICO an opportunity to expand its customer base, enhance its product offerings and increase its market share in the aftermarket jet service business area. Such consolidations should improve economies of scale for the industry as a whole, with the players having access to diversified business models.Recovering Air Traffic View Boosts Prospects: World air travel data has been on a steady growth trajectory for the past few months. Per the latest outlook published by IATA in June 2023, the airline industry is forecast to return to profitability in 2023, only three years after the historic loss of $140 billion in 2020. Total airline revenues are expected to recover to around 93% of the 2019 figure, with operating profits reaching $22.4 billion. Such projections should boost demand for aircraft parts, which, in turn should benefit aerospace-defense equipment industry stocks, especially those engaged in commercial aviation.Unusual Strength of the Dollar Remains a Concern: Global inflation rose to 8.7% in 2022 and is likely to pull back to 6.8% in 2023, leaving the price level higher. Although this may take place at a somewhat slower pace, the price is still rising. A stronger U.S. dollar, apart from high inflation and high jet fuel prices, puts pressure on airlines. This is because U.S. dollar-denominated costs rise for all businesses whose revenues are in another currency.An appreciated U.S. dollar value is a risk for aerospace-defense equipment stocks, particularly the ones in commercial aerospace, considering the fact that the share of jet fuel in airlines’ operating costs is considerably high, between 25% and 30%.Supply-Chain Disruption Poses Risk: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented crisis in the aerospace and defense supply chain. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) need to dramatically scale back their capacity to reflect the new realities of the commercial air travel market. Such OEM rate reductions have been affecting the extended commercial aerospace manufacturing supply chain, which might lower earnings and cash flows for the aerospace and defense equipment industry in the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright OutlookThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #48, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

HCA is well-poised to grow on the back of expanding patient volumes and growing admissions. Its inorganic growth strategy and same-store facility figures are also encouraging.Over the past year, shares of HCA Healthcare have gained 25.6%, outperforming the industry’s 19.7% growth. Headquartered in Nashville, TN, HCA operates general and acute care hospitals. It has a market cap of $71 billion.Solid Rank &amp; VGM ScoreHCA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company seems to be an appropriate investment proposition at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s delve deeper.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s current-year earnings is pegged at $18.44 per share, which has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 30 days against none in the opposite direction. The estimate indicates 9.2% year-over-year growth. HCA Healthcare beat on earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 5.4%.HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHCA Healthcare, Inc. price-eps-surprise | HCA Healthcare, Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues is pegged at $63.9 billion, signaling a 6% year-over-year increase. The company’s operating strength is enabling it to rise above multiple headwinds like stuffing challenges.We expect its Managed Medicare and Medicaid operations to witness nearly 13% and 14% year-over-year increase, respectively, in 2023, which will support the top-line growth. Managed Care &amp; Insurers operations have also witnessed growth in the first half of this year, following last year’s 3.9% decline. We expect it to increase nearly 7% in 2023.Our estimate for 2023 equivalent admissions suggests an almost 5% year-over-year increase. Inpatient revenues per admission witnessed significant growth in the second quarter. Although the growth rate will likely decrease a bit in the second half, the full-year rate is expected to be higher than a year ago.Story continuesMoreover, our estimate for inpatient and outpatient surgery cases for 2023 signals around a 2% year-over-year increase each. As seniors have resumed delayed elective procedures, demand for services provided by companies like HCA is expected to rise, which will drive patient volumes.RisksDespite the upside potential, investors should keep an eye out for its expenses, which have been rising for the past few years and constraining its bottom line from reaching its full potential. Staffing challenges, although rapidly decreasing, still can keep expenses high. We expect total costs to rise nearly 6% in 2023.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Medical space are Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM, Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC and Atai Life Sciences N.V.

(HCA) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-hca-healthcare-inc-130011532.html,1694696411,STORY,['HCA'],"[HCA Healthcare (HCA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this hospital operator have returned -1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, which HCA falls in, has lost 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.HCA is expected to post earnings of $4.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.2%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.23 indicates a change of +9.7% from what HCA is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, HCA is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of HCA, the consensus sales estimate of $15.8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.5%. The $63.86 billion and $67.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHCA reported revenues of $15.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. EPS of $4.29 for the same period compares with $4.21 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.84%. The EPS surprise was +0.23%.Over the last four quarters, HCA surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.HCA is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about HCA. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.3%, 16.4% and 32%, respectively.Despite facing volatility in the past four weeks, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. However, several S&amp;P 500 components lagged the index to a big extent. A handful of those laggers are U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank. We have selected five such stocks that have vast upside left.Momentum Likely to ContinueThe inflation rate has been dwindling steadily since June 2022. The consumer price index of August came in at a three-month high. However, that was primarily due to higher energy prices. Moreover, the fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduced the possibility of a near-term recession.On Sep 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift from its rigorous interest rate hike policy, the Fed would restrain from a rate hike at this month’s FOMC meeting. Moreover, the journal reported that Fed officials are considering all aspects about whether more rate hikes are at all needed this year.At present, the Fed fund rate is in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The CME FedWatch tool is showing a 97% probability that the Fed will maintain a status quo in the September FOMC meeting, while a mere 3% chance is there that the rate will be hiked by 25 basis points.Athough the inflation rate is currently well above the Fed’s 2% target level, majority of Fed officials are of the view that further tightening of monetary policies may be detrimental to the economy. Monetary policy variables always affect the economy during a lag period. Therefore, Fed officials believe that the central bank should wait for the full effect of the current level of interest rate to be visible.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with strong potential for the rest of 2023.

(NYSE:PPG) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:""We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.""Story continuespainting tools, coloring toolsCopyright: stockasso / 123RF Stock PhotoPPG Industries, Inc.

PPG is gaining from favorable market conditions, pricing actions, enhanced manufacturing efficiencies, cost discipline and acquisitions amid headwinds from demand weakness in Europe and China.The company’s shares are up 10.4% over a year, compared with 13.5% rise of its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Cost &amp; Pricing Actions, Acquisitions Drive PPGPPG Industries is benefiting from higher pricing across its segments, manufacturing efficiencies, cost actions and efforts to grow its business through acquisitions.The company is implementing a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy, as well as optimizing its working capital requirements. The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end markets with weak business conditions. The company achieved $15 million in incremental cost reductions through restructuring programs and acquisition synergies in the second quarter of 2023.PPG Industries is also raising selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of raw material and other cost inflation and drive profitability. Significant progress has been made in increasing consolidated segment margins, which were more than 16% in the second quarter, up 330 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Pricing measures are likely to continue to support its margins in the remainder of 2023.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance in 2023. Acquisitions, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line this year.PPG Industries also remains committed to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The company, in July 2023, raised its quarterly dividend by around 5% to 65 cents per share. In 2022, the company returned around $570 million to shareholders through dividends and about $190 million through share repurchases. It also paid dividends worth around $146 million in the second quarter of 2023.Story continuesWeaker Demand AilsThe company remains exposed to soft demand conditions in Europe and China. Industrial production remains muted, mainly due to cautious consumer buying behavior in Europe and a slow recovery in China. Moreover, softening demand in certain end-use markets in the United States adds to the difficulties. Geopolitical issues in Europe arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict impacted demand, while the lingering impacts of pandemic-related restrictions in China led to increased economic uncertainties during the second quarter.PPG Industries anticipates a low single-digit percentage decline in organic sales in its Industrial Coatings unit in the third quarter of 2023 due to lower global industrial production. While automotive is expected to remain strong, other industrial end-use markets, including industrial coatings and packaging coatings, are anticipated to be soft in the third quarter. PPG Industries, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of the most valuable currencies and the major players facilitating currency exchange, you can head to the 5 Most Valuable Currencies in the World in 2023.Is the US Dollar on Track?The US dollar has long been the sole leader in the world. With global transactional dominance at its forefront, the US dollar is known as the primary foreign currency reserve. The dynamics of the dollar influence global economies to act accordingly. The rising dollar impacts the prices of commodities worldwide, including imports and exports. After a period of decline, the dollar seems to be gaining value against other currencies. On September 5, CNBC reported that the services industry has experienced a significant increase in the past month, contributing to the growth of the dollar to a six-month high. After a rough period of decline against the euro and the British pound, the dollar gained slight power. As the rest of the G-10 countries succumb to expected economic downturns, there are lower chances that the United States may experience anything similar. To further elaborate on the strength of the US dollar, Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA in Washington, stated:“It’s clear the US economy remains much stronger by comparison than most of the rest of the G10 and runs substantially less risk of entering a recession. With the UK and the eurozone teetering on the brink of true contraction, investors really have little choice but to place their faith in the US (economy).”Is De-Dollarization the Future?Is the Dollar's position as the world leader here to stay? Will other currencies rise to dethrone the US dollar? While many countries have been adopting their national currencies for trade, experts have mixed opinions on the likelihood of such.On August 24, Reuters reported that Brazil's president suggested that the BRICS nations develop a common currency to facilitate trade and exchange. The goal for such was to prevent any adverse implications of dollar exchange rate volatility. Putin added to the conversation by recommending that the nations trade in their national currencies instead of using the dollar. If this suggestion continues, the dollar may lose its power over global trade and exchange. With more emerging powers being introduced to the BRICS, the threat of de-dollarization persists.Story continuesHowever, on the other end of the spectrum, the likelihood of a possible de-dollarization occurrence seems unlikely. On September 11, Reuters reported that China's central bank took a step ahead to scrutinize bulk dollar purchases by Chinese companies. The new policy prevents companies from purchasing over $50 million without approval from the People's Bank of China (PBOC). The Chinese yuan has been depreciating, and to prevent further decline in the value of the yuan against the US dollar, such measures are deemed necessary by the central bank. The yuan is expected to weaken by more than $7.5 in the future. The depreciation of the yuan against the dollar limits the chances of de-dollarization. On September 12, Reuters reported that the dollar experienced another rebound after a long period of decline for the past few months. The dollar index rose by 5% and now is at its highest point for the first time in a few months. This has led the yuan to hit an all-time low since December 2007.Developing trust in a currency requires mass adoption and stability. With the volatile nature of powerful currencies like the Chinese yuan, it is unlikely that any other currency could gain transactional dominance in the foreseeable future. However, the threat of a possible de-dollarization must not be ignored.International Banks: The Face of Foreign ExchangeInternational banks are major players in the global market. Some banks own up to their name to act as credible institutions for people worldwide. Some of these companies include Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). These banks have posed positive growth and a significant profit increase during rising interest rates and the rising dollar.On September 7, Reuters reported that Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) are expected to post strong results next year compared to other banks with similar market caps. The two banks could post strong single-digit or slightly lower double-digit digital growth figures in 2024 despite a significant decline in investment banking.HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) is a universal bank specializing in financial services. The bank is based in London, United Kingdom. The company plays a significant role in the smooth operation of foreign trade and exchange. It enjoys high profitability. On August 1, Reuters reported that the company raised its profitability beyond its target. Moreover, the company also revealed a $2 billion share buyback. The primary reason for this was rising interest rates by the central bank, facilitating the bank with more income and users.Posing strong earnings is important for international banks. However, banks must not rely on the workings of the interest rate to determine a company's earnings. Companies need to invest where it matters. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a multinational investment bank in the United States. The company is one of the largest banks in the United States and is a major player in foreign exchange and trade. On August 24, Reuters reported that Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) acquired a stake in Rextie, a Peruvian Foreign Exchange Startup. Rextie is a huge name in foreign exchange. The startup was founded in 2016 and has closed $4.5 billion in foreign exchange. The company processes transitions through its digital platform, fueling foreign exchange growth between countries.International banks facilitate the transfer and exchange of currencies. Currencies and cryptocurrencies alike are traded internationally and are more likely to be valued by people across the globe. Check out some of the most powerful currencies in the world and the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. With that, let's discuss the 30 most valuable currencies in the world in 2023.30 Most Valuable Currencies in the World in 2023Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor our methodology, we sourced the exchange rates for our currencies from XRates and we sourced the dollar value of cryptocurrencies from Yahoo Finance. Our ranking was based on each currency's value against the US dollar. The dollar is known as the strongest foreign currency reserve accounting for a major chunk of international trade. Therefore, it is a suitable measure to assess the value of a currency. To account for the rising use of cryptocurrencies across the world, we included them in our list. Cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $10 billion, as of September 12, were included only. The US dollar tops the list because all currencies are measured against the currency. All exchange rates are as of September 12.30 Most Valuable Currencies in the World in 202330.

The so-called Magnificent 7 stocks are responsible for 73% of the S&amp;P 500 gains this year. If you eliminate the performance of the top 10 stocks in the index, the rest are performing at break-even.But that’s what can happen when investors pile into high-profile stocks Wall Street loves. There’s a big risk if one or more of those select companies stumbles.Looking for under-the-radar companies the crowd hasn’t latched onto yet just might serve you better. It was one of the areas investing legend Peter Lynch sought out over his illustrious career.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOne of the greatest money managers of all time, Lynch took Fidelity Magellan from $20 million in assets under management (AUM) to $14 billion AUM in 13 years. He also averaged 29% annual returns over that period. So, if you can find out-of-the-way stocks with which Wall Street happens to agree have good prospects for long-term growth, you might just end up with some big winners.Aptiv (APTV)An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.Source: shutterstock.comDespite being one of the biggest auto parts companies by market cap, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) still isn’t as well known as some of its smaller brethren. Its profile has risen markedly since partnering with ride-sharing company Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Customers have taken over 100,000 rides in autonomous vehicles since the partnership launched in 2020.As connected cars become more commonplace, Aptiv will grow with them. That’s because Aptiv was the connected mobility division of Delphi Automotive, which split in two in 2017. The powertrain business that became Delphi Technologies was subsequently acquired by BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) three years ago.Net sales jumped 12% in 2022 to $17.5 billion and are 22% higher over the first six months of 2023. Aptiv’s smart vehicle technology and software capabilities are driving the gains. It resulted in $20 billion worth of new business awards so far this year.Story continuesAnalysts see Aptiv growing earnings at a 33% compounded annual rate for the next five years, but the stock trades for less than twice its sales. That could be why Wall Street rates the stock as a Buy. With a consensus of $129.95 per share one-year price target, analysts see at least 29% more upside in this stock.Badger Meter (BMI)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comBadger Meter (NYSE:BMI) is a small but growing smart water meter company. Reading the water meter is such a banal task that most homeowners don’t even think about it. Maybe they do once a month when the utility company comes around to take a reading.The future, though, is in remote, smart meter technology, and Badger hopes to be an industry leader in the conversion.Badger points out there are more than 50,000 water utilities in the U.S.  It estimates approximately 70% of their respective connections have converted to a radio solution. That means no more looking at the spinning dials on your meter. Half of those, however, still utilize automatic meter reading (AMR) technology, requiring a water utility worker to go out and collect the data.On the other hand, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) eliminates the need for employees to go door-to-door. The smart meter itself automatically transmits the data to the company, and it can do so more than once a month. That allows the utility to monitor for abnormalities, such as leaks. Badger is well-positioned for the conversion trend to AMI meters.Most of Badger’s revenue is derived in the U.S., giving it global expansion opportunities ahead, too.Water stocks possess large growth potential because clean water and wastewater treatment are essential. It’s why I invested in American States Water (NYSE:AWR). The company provides water to homes in 9 states and 11 U.S. military bases. Monitoring the systems through smart meter technology provides investors with a higher growth trajectory than simply buying utility stocks.Boston Omaha (BOC)Two businesspeople holding and pointing at earnings charts.Source: ShutterstockBoston Omaha (NYSE:BOC) is a conglomerate that owns outdoor billboard advertising, an insurance company, broadband services and an asset management business.If that sounds remotely familiar to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B), there’s a reason. Both are structured in similar ways and pursue similar types of investments. In fact, the founder of Boston Omaha has an investment style similar to Warren Buffett.That’s not surprising either since one of the chief executive officers (CEO), Alex Rozek, is the grandson of Buffett’s late sister Doris (Rozek’s middle name is Buffett).Yet I hesitate to call Boston Omaha the next Berkshire or Rosek the next Warren Buffett. Far too often investors have seen self-styled Buffett-like figures fail to live up to the hype. Heck, even purported crypto Ponzi scheme mastermind Sam Bankman-Fried was dubbed “the next Warren Buffett” by Fortune magazine.Still, Boston Omaha does offer an interesting investment opportunity. Billboard rentals generate the bulk of revenue, some 44%. Broadband services account for another 36%. Revenue increased 10% and 8%, respectively, due to better business conditions for both segments. Plus, the company turned losses into profits last quarter.The stock is down sharply in 2023, losing 34% of its value, but the real value is in its long-term potential. Wall Street is on board with analysts giving Boston Omaha’s stock a buy rating with near 100% upside over the next 12 months.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in AWR stock.

Following a shaky fiscal 2022, marked by a drop in subscribers, the streaming giant is roaring back by effectively recalibrating its strategies with finesse, culminating in a resurgence in customer engagement and stock performance. Consequently, NFLX stock has gained over 39% year-to-date but trades roughly 17.41% lower than its 52-week high price of $485.NFLX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NFLXAmidst a rather complex market landscape, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) has demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for enhancing profitability, complemented by strong revenue growth numbers in recent quarters. Furthermore, current trajectories indicate a continued upward trend for the company's financial metrics. Observers might even argue the stock is undervalued based on a few metrics. Hence, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) seems to be scripting a narrative of resurgence worth watching.Strategic Expansion in AdvertisingNetflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s dominant position in the television landscape is evident, with it holding a commanding 80% share of television viewership, with 70% of its viewers in the age bracket of 18-49. Its advertisement slots run from 4 to 5 minutes, showing significant long-term potential for growth in this area.Instead of adhering to a standard approach, the company is experimenting with different ad durations based on content type while exploring sponsorships, aiming to offer companies unique opportunities within the platform. Moreover, it's leveraging its vast user base and data analytics while enhancing its ad targeting precision. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s strategy in advertising is threefold, which involves prioritizing viewer experience, acknowledging the diversity of its content, and aspiring to revolutionize the future of advertising.Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s management has recently shared some telling figures. Notably, its powerful ad-tier boasts five million monthly active users, with a quarter of new users choosing this feature where available.Story continuesAddressing Financial Challenges and Future OutlookRecent data showed a 1% drop in Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s Adjusted Revenue Metrics (ARM), with varied performances across different regions. However, in correcting the situation, the company has made strategic moves to boost its ARM in the upcoming quarters. In doing so, it temporarily paused its price hikes, instead focusing on introducing the paid sharing feature. This decision coincides with noticeable shifts in subscriber demographics, as a significant portion now hails from countries contributing to a lower ARM.Moreover, the introduction and expansion of the paid sharing feature have surpassed expectations, marking a remarkably successful venture. Augmenting these strategies, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s management has taken the bold step of phasing out the basic ad-free tier in certain regions. This move, in combination with their focus on paid sharing and evolving advertising strategies, is projected to lead to a significant revenue boost.Operational Efficiency and New VenturesParallel to these revenue strategies, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) diligently manages its operational expenses with an eye on efficiency. Also, it's setting an ambitious target of achieving a 400 basis point increase in profit margins by 2024. Furthermore, the company is aware of the growing competition in the streaming sphere and has recently ventured into adjacent verticals, including video gaming, allowing access only to its subscribers.Though initial adoption was low, with less than 1% of users downloading its games, Undeterred, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) considers gaming pivotal for its future, recently testing its cloud gaming service in the U.K. and Canada. These games, less graphics-intensive, can be played using smartphones as controllers. This foray could enhance subscription value if successful, potentially reducing subscriber churn.Valuation and Stock PerformanceIn terms of valuation, NFLX stock has enjoyed a more than decent rally this year, trading at pricing metrics that are mostly ahead of its competition. However, based on a historical standpoint, it's trading at a discount across multiple metrics. For instance, its median price-to-sales ratio stands at 1.7 times, significantly lower than what it currently trades at 0.8 times forward sales. Moreover, it ranks better than 54.4% of 522 companies in the media-diversified industry.Furthermore, it trades at 43.7 times its free cash flows, significantly lower than its decade-long average of 184.68 times. Similar is the case with its price-to-earnings ratio, which is at 43.9 times, meaningfully lower than its median at 127.4 times.Final Thoughts on NFLX StockNetflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) demonstrated robust recovery following a challenging 2022, marked by a 39% bump in its stock value. Holding an impressive 80% viewership, the company is redefining its advertising approach. Moving beyond standard ads, it's looking to experiment with durations and sponsorships while targeting the lucrative 18-49 demographic.Financially, even with a slight 1% decrease in ARM, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s focus on strategies such as paid sharing points to positive momentum ahead for the stock. Aligned with changes in subscriber demographics, the new features hint at a prosperous financial future. Additionally, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s venture into the realm of cloud gaming underscores its ambition to diversify and boost user engagement by diversifying its income streams. As the year progresses, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s dynamic moves position it as one of the best streaming plays at this time.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The show has attracted huge support from fan communities of the manga created by Eiichiro Oda, with viewers generating memes on social media platforms such as X and TikTok.The live-action adaptation marked a close collaboration between teams in the US and Japan, with creator Oda presiding over the cast and characters, according to Netflix executives. The company’s Japanese team ensured the production stuck to character narratives and nuances, while the US team worked on the storytelling. It was Oda’s decision to do the show in English.“This was the first time where we had IP that really invited and required multiple perspectives and different creative teams,” Peter Friedlander, Netflix’s vice president of scripted series in the US and Canada, said in an interview. “We really partnered together across the time zones and across languages. We knew how important that was for the success of it.”Netflix is aiming for a similar joint production with Season 2. It sees that cross-cultural playbook — with US teams helping to develop popular stories from other countries — working for projects beyond anime.Story continues“It has expanded the possibility of live action not only in Japan but also in the world,” said Kaata Sakamoto, the company’s vice president for content in Japan.One Piece follows the adventures of young pirates on an ocean journey to find a fabled treasure. An animated TV series based on the comics spans 1,000 episodes, and One Piece is expanding through PlayStation games, films and merchandise.It remains to be seen if the show can deliver long-term viewership that matches other monster hits from Netflix, which recently changed its metrics. Season 4 of the fantasy series Stranger Things generated more than 1.8 billion hours viewed over three months, according to Netflix. One Piece has more than 280 million so far.Although Netflix didn’t confirm plans beyond the next season, the company sees potential for longevity in the comic books’ many characters and story lines. Details for Season 2, including episode count, will be announced later, Netflix said in a statement.“It’ll still take a while to get the scripts ready, so please be patient,” Oda said. “From here on, it seems to me the Straw Hats will need a great doctor...We will see!”The business of anime, or Japanese cartoons, is growing faster outside Japan. Streaming services operated by Sony Group Corp. and Walt Disney Co. are also betting on the genre.It took seven years to turn the 26-year-old manga characters of One Piece into a live-action series, according to company officials. The cross-border partnership between the two production teams wasn’t easy, especially during the Covid, Friedlander said.Partnering with Tomorrow Studios, filming was scheduled originally in Cape Town in 2020 but was delayed by the pandemic. The cost per episode came to about $18 million, according to reports. The US and Japanese teams held Zoom meetings at odd hours to facilitate their cooperation and there was also a language barrier, Friedlander said, adding his team started learning Japanese.“We are all on this adventure together,” Friedlander said. “We are sailing off for the next one.”--With assistance from Mayumi Negishi.(Updates with company statement.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Dollar General Might Just Be the Worst Retail Job in AmericaWhy Your Starbucks Wait Is So LongMBAs Are Spurning McKinsey to Buy Small CompaniesAmbani’s Plan to Upend Indian Finance Lands With a ThudTikTok Shop Is a Real E-Commerce Threat©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Moreover, we learned that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) remained king as far as streaming goes. What Netflix is in the streaming universe of movies and series, Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) is in the music streaming galaxy. Despite challenges that are plaguing the industry, these two players managed to remain on their respective thrones.Netflix Got A Kick Out Of Its First Mover AdvantageNetflix basically created its own throne as it went into streaming back in the 2010s and long before its industry peers. Netflix may not have the marquee content like Disney has, but its massive content library clearly is appealing to a vast population. Moreover, Netflix went on an overseas conquest, making significant effort to make foreign language content and produce it locally that was key for its international footprint that keeps on growing. With Europe, Mexico, South Korea and Brazil under its belt, Netflix became an unmatched global player. Although today, its shares fell 3% as its CFO Spencer Neumann showed Netflix is in no rush to boost margins, one must not forget that the streaming king already eased profitability concerns and is a rare entertainment player who reported sunny earnings despite a revenue miss, amid a cloudy Hollywood strikes climate. It also added 5.9 million users during the second quarter thanks to its password sharing crackdown. Yesterday, at the Bank of America investment conference, Neumann disappointed with a soft operating margins guidance between 18 and 20%, below the current consensus of 22.1% but as he noted, building an advertising business from scratch is by no means an easy task. But while Disney keeps on getting hit and losing subscribers, Netflix’s struggles are far less severe.Spotify Showed To Be Somewhat Resistant To The Streaming FatigueSpotify did disappoint with revenue figures and guidance from its latest quarterly report. Its second quarter revenue rose 11% YoY to 3.18 billion euros which came short of Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of 3.21 billion euros. Spotify also made a loss of 1.55 euros per share.Story continuesSpotify also has scary global competitors, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). However, nor Google nor Amazon nor Apple focus as much on music streaming which is Spotify’s entire universe. No one, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Spotify, is resistant to the streaming slowdown.But Spotify did manage to grow its monthly active users 27% to 551 million in its latest reported quarter with its paid subscribers count increasing 17% YoY to 220 million, both topping expectations and proving that Spotify is somewhat resistant to the streaming fatigue that has plagued the industry.Navigating Through Challenging Industry TimesOne could conclude that it might be too late to catch up to these two players that are clearly dominating their fields and navigating challenging times for the streaming and entertainment industry. The fall of Disney shows that even size and legacy can’t protect a company from the industry-wide crisis, but Spotify and Netflix show that a first-mover’s advantage is not only a powerful weapon against scary competitors like Disney, Apple, Amazon and Google, but that it is also a life-saver during difficult times. In their own respective way, Netflix and Spotify certainly made the right niche commitments that are now cushioning them against industry-wide hits.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The executive said he anticipates full-year operating margins, which peaked at 21%, to be in the range of 18% to 20% — in line with company expectations, although current consensus estimates are just below 20% for full-year 2023.Neumann went on to explain he expects margins to ""tick up again going forward"" as the company leans on multiple revenue initiatives, such as the crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported offering. But he warned both of those initiatives, especially the advertising business, will take time to mature.""We're still in the crawl of the crawl-walk-run stage, so it is not easy to build an ad business from scratch. We got a lot of work to do,"" he said.He added that ""as you've seen in our guidance, what we've done so far is not material to the overall revenue of the business. It's something we're building into and we have to get better across the board.""Neumann said the company needs to ""scale the reach"" of its ad tier, explaining, ""Advertisers want a scaled solution. So that is the No. 1 priority. And then No. 2 is to better monetize that reach.""Still, the executive said he's bullish over the long term, revealing the company met its ad expectations at its first Upfronts and that the rate of new subscribers signing up for the ad tier is ""healthy,"" although he wouldn't provide a specific number.Those who spin off from previous accounts and sign up for their own plans as a result of the password crackdown, however, are leaning more towards premium tiers, he revealed.""The ad tier is a healthy mix in general across our plans, but it's the minority because we have multiple plans. It skews a little bit more towards ad-free in these spin-offs,"" he said.Story continuesNetflix CFO Spencer Neumann touched on multiple facets of the business but disappointed investors with his comments on operating margins. (Getty Images) (Wachiwit via Getty Images)Neumann also weighed in on the ongoing Hollywood strikes as talks once again stall after the writers guild rejected the studios' latest offer.""It’s not good for the business,"" he told moderator and analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. ""At the end of the day, to move the business forward and to have great storytelling and fresh stories for our members, it really is about partnership with those writers, with those producers, with those directors, with those actors.""""We need that partnership to be healthy. We need to get back to work. That's what we're focused on,"" he added.Based on Neumann's comments, Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak lowered his fourth quarter average revenue-per-user (ARPU) growth expectations to 2% from 4%, in addition to reducing his Q4 revenue forecast to $8.73 billion — down from the prior $8.89 billion.Wlodarczak said this reduction reflects ""more of an initial subscriber benefit rather than an ARPU benefit from their move to monetize 100M+ households formally not paying for the service [by sharing accounts]."" He also raised his free cash flow estimate by $500 million to $6 billion amid the strikes.The analyst maintained his Buy rating on the stock and $600 price target — the highest on the Street.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

With a variety of midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses, Phillips 66 is a powerhouse in the energy sector. The company processes, transports, stores and markets fuels and products globally, making it a crucial player in the global energy market.The insider's recent sell-off is part of a broader trend within the company. Over the past year, there has been only one insider buy at Phillips 66, compared to nine insider sells. This could indicate a lack of confidence in the company's short-term prospects among its top executives.Executive Vice President Timothy Roberts Sells 12,970 Shares of Phillips 66On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Phillips 66 were trading for $124.41 apiece, giving the company a market cap of $54.91 billion. This is a significant figure, and it's worth noting that the insider's sell-off represents a small fraction of the company's total market cap.The price-earnings ratio of Phillips 66 is 5.35, which is lower than the industry median of 9.15 and lower than the companys historical median price-earnings ratio. This could suggest that the stock is undervalued, but other factors must be considered.Executive Vice President Timothy Roberts Sells 12,970 Shares of Phillips 66According to the GuruFocus Value, which is an intrinsic value estimate based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance, Phillips 66 is modestly overvalued. With a price of $124.41 and a GuruFocus Value of $111.33, the stock has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.12.In conclusion, the insider's recent sell-off, combined with the broader trend of insider sells at Phillips 66, could be a cause for concern for investors. However, the company's strong market cap and relatively low price-earnings ratio suggest that it remains a solid investment in the long term. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Pfizer PFE, BioNTech BNTX, Moderna MRNA and Novavax NVAX.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:FDA Approves Pfizer, Moderna's New Covid VaccinesThe FDA approved Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s updated mRNA vaccines to protect against the currently circulating strains of the COVID-19 virus.Moderna and Pfizer’s updated mRNA vaccines are each approved for individuals 12 years of age and older and are authorized under emergency use for individuals 6 months through 11 years of age.Pre-clinical/clinical data from studies on Moderna and Pfizer’s updated mRNA vaccines have shown improved neutralizing antibody responses against multiple circulating Omicron-related sub-lineages, including XBB.1.5, BA.2.86 (also called Pirola) and EG.5.1 (also called Eris).Moderna and Pfizer’s mRNA vaccines have been updated to include a single component that corresponds to the Omicron variant XBB.1.5, as directed by the FDA in June. In the said month, XBB.1.5, a subvariant of Omicron, was the dominant variant. Now, the dominant strains are Pirola and Eris. However, the companies are confident that their updated vaccines can provide protection against Pirola and Eris, which closely match the XBB.1.5 subvariant.Infection rates are once again climbing in the United States, with Pirola and Eris accounting for the majority of the cases.Moderna and Pfizer have been manufacturing the updated vaccines at risk and believe they will be ready for commercial delivery of the updated vaccines for the 2023-2024 fall and winter season.They expect the vaccines to be launched in pharmacies, hospitals and clinics across the United States once the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the jab. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet on Sep 12 to provide recommendations on who should receive an updated vaccine.Story continuesNovavax has also developed an updated protein-based non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to target XBB lineages. However, the FDA did not give a green signal to Novavax’s updated vaccine. Novavax’s stock was down almost 13% in response.Novavax issued a press release stating that it is ready to distribute its updated vaccine for the fall season once it receives FDA approval and CDC recommendation.Drugmakers are trying to promote the idea of people taking an updated COVID shot along with their annual flu vaccination. However, some experts feel the protection offered by these updated shots wanes over time and with a new variant superseding the older one. Sales of Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax suffered in 2022 and the first half of 2023 as demand for COVID vaccines declined. It remains to be seen if these new “boosters” provide some boost to their makers’ top lines.Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s regulatory filings seeking approval for the updated vaccines are also under review in Europe, with a decision anticipated in the coming weeks.Pfizer and Moderna have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

The panel approved the vaccines from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Novavax (NVAX) is still awaiting authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its booster. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani explains the story.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: The CDC has made the final call on COVID booster approvals. So what do we need to know?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So the advisory committee just voted a majority in favor of approving those vaccine boosters. That's the one that Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax have all been updating as a monovalent, so that just a single targeting those variants, XBB.1.5, in particular. Now what this means is that those doses should be available as soon as the CDC director signs off on this. And that will open the door to get those vaccinations done for fall.Now, just a point of note, we did-- we do know that, of course, both Pfizer and Moderna did already get the green light from the FDA. However, Novavax is still waiting on their authorization to go through, because they haven't yet-- there isn't actually a clear reason why they haven't been able to get that. So while we were waiting to get all three out the door, see all three get their authorization and that green light and basically open the doors, only two so far will be able to do that as soon as the CDC signs off.The way they did vote on it today though, is to allow once Novavax gets their approval to be able to join in on the market. We also got some interesting insight from the meeting today, which is the list prices of these vaccines. If you recall earlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna gave a range of about 110 to 130. And if you see on your screen, they're falling on the middle upper range of that. Meanwhile, Novavax at 130 per dose. Again, that is a list price. Of course, we know the insured won't necessarily have to pay that. And of course, there are rebates and the like that go on with all these contracts. So just a little insight into that.But as of right now, we have potentially three new vaccines to be able to take this winter, again, once one of them gets greenlit. So that's the news for right now.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Just in time as we see those cases tick up for COVID. Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much for that.]"

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.NRG Energy in FocusHeadquartered in Houston, NRG Energy (NRG) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 21.81% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.38 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.9%. In comparison, the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield is 3.7%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.67%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. NRG Energy has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 88.27%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 39%, meaning it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for NRG for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.55 per share, with earnings expected to increase 73.66% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

170,3e0bab25-91f1-323c-a2b4-c58b8f0e499b,NEE,2023-09-15,Returns At NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) Appear To Be Weighed Down,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-nextera-energy-nyse-nee-110120860.html,1694775680,STORY,['NEE'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NextEra Energy:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.065 = US$9.3b ÷ (US$168b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 6.5%. In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.5%. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy roceIn the above chart we have measured NextEra Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NextEra Energy here  for free.What Can We Tell From NextEra Energy's ROCE Trend?The returns on capital haven't changed much for NextEra Energy in recent years. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 6.5% and the business has deployed 68% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...As we've seen above, NextEra Energy's returns on capital haven't increased but it is reinvesting in the business. Since the stock has gained an impressive 83% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for NextEra Energy   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) that you should know about.While NextEra Energy may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

171,2d41fb49-c874-3ccd-8c9b-1b5bfaca4885,NEE,2023-09-15,‘Vintage Values’: Morgan Stanley Says These Are the Top Stocks for a One-Year Buy-and-Hold Investment Horizon — Here’s What Makes Them Stand Out,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vintage-values-morgan-stanley-says-005142202.html,1694739102,STORY,"['MS', 'MDT', 'NEE']","[A smart investor is a patient investor, in the game for the long haul. Warren Buffett, a legend in the markets, has long been known for advocating long-term holdings – and so does the banking giant Morgan Stanley. The bank’s annual ‘Vintage Values’ report points out the firm’s top stocks for a ‘buy-and-hold’ strategy on the one-year horizon.The current Vintage Values list has a lot to say on the subject, but a few features of their picks stand out. First, all of their choices are mid- or large-cap stocks. Second, their Vintage Values selections lean strongly towards high-quality names. And finally, these names are trading at a bargain compared to the market.There’s one more important point to make about Morgan Stanley’s Vintage Value list. Since they started publishing these picks 14 years ago, the list has tended to outperform the S&amp;P 500. The 2022-2023 list, the predecessor of this one, beat the index by 941 basis points over 12 months.So let’s see just what Morgan Stanley says investors should buy and hold. Here are two of the firm’s Vintage Values.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE)The first Vintage Value pick we’re looking at is NextEra, a renewable energy company and an important component of the clean energy industry. NextEra has between $85 billion and $95 billion in infrastructure improvements planned for the next two years, and has 67 gigawatts of power generation in operation. NextEra is the owner of the Florida Power &amp; Light company, the largest electric utility in the US, and provides power to more than 12 million people across the state of Florida.In addition to its Florida operations, NextEra has assets in several other states, including emission-free nuclear power generation in Wisconsin and New Hampshire. The company is a leader in wind and solar power generation, and operates multiple renewable power generation facilities in Texas.All of that is good, but NextEra sees the future of power generation in the hydrogen energy sector. The company is working with US government agencies to develop and fund green hydrogen energy projects, and is investing up to $20 billion into hydrogen capital projects, with a goal to develop up to 15 gigawatts of renewable hydrogen power generation by 2026.Story continuesAt the bottom line, the company’s revenues have been increasing in recent years. In the last quarterly report, for 2Q23, NextEra reported revenues of $7.35 billion, beating the estimates by $1.18 billion and increasing almost 42% year-over-year. The company’s bottom line, a non-GAAP EPS of 88 cents, was 6 cents per share better than had been expected.All of this leads Morgan Stanley’s David Arcaro to an upbeat view of the company. The analyst writes, “We remain bullish given low earnings risk, continued strong renewables demand, improving supply chain backdrop, and green hydrogen upside… Hydrogen projects will require deep skill sets across several areas where NEE has advantages. We expect NEE to be a leader in the green hydrogen market regardless of the Treasury provisions.”Arcaro’s comments back up his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on NEE, and his price target, now set at $90, suggests ~30% upside potential on the one-year timeline. (To watch Arcaro’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock has attracted 10 recent reviews from the Street, with an 8 to 2 breakdown favoring Buys over Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares’ $69.28 trading price and $84.90 average price target give the stock ~23% potential gain in the next 12 months. (See NextEra stock forecast)Medtronic PLC (MDT)The next stock we’ll look at from the Morgan Stanley Vintage Value list is Medtronic, a medical device company with a wide range of products targeting a variety of conditions. The company has a global footprint, and is a leader in healthcare technology, describing its mission as ‘attacking the most challenging health problems facing humanity.’Some basic numbers will show the scale and reach of Medtronic’s operations. The company’s products have helped more than 74 million patients over the years, and looking forward, Medtronic has more than 210 active clinical trials testing out new devices and products. In its fiscal year 2023, which ended this past April, Medtronic reported making $2.7 billion worth of R&amp;D investments, a solid indicator of confidence in its approach. And, of particular interest to return-minded investors, the company paid out $3.6 billion in dividends to its shareholders in fiscal year 2023.The dividend is worth a closer look. Medtronic has already declared its dividend for fiscal 2Q24. The payment of 69 cents per common share marks a 1-cent increase from the year-ago quarter, and will annualize to 3.4%. The company has a dividend history stretching back to the 1970s.Medtronic last reported earnings for Q1 of fiscal 2024, and showed a 4.5% year-over-year increase at the top line; the revenue figure of $7.7 billion beat the forecast by over $144 million. The company’s non-GAAP EPS, at $1.20 per share, was 9 cents better than expected. In a move that bodes well going forward, Medtronic also bumped up its earnings guidance, to the range of $5.08 to $5.16 per share, or a 7-cent increase at the midpoint. This compared favorably to the $5.05 consensus EPS guidance expectation.Looking under the hood at this stock, Morgan Stanley’s Patrick Wood lays out multiple reasons for an upbeat outlook: “We see MDT’s pipe as well stocked from the innovation standpoint (e.g. Inceptiv, 780G, Simplera, Spyral, Micra, Pulse Select etc.), and gross margins are trending in the right direction with a c. 115bps beat despite heavy S&amp;OP and supply chain work. Indeed, gross margin delivery back to c. 68% is worth c. 12% to group earnings alone, and we expect MDT to drive more consistent execution as it consolidates supply and manufacturing.”“Trading on sub 15x calendar ’24 P/E, despite what we expect to be consistent MSD organic growth and potential c. 200bps upside to margins, along with less crowded positioning, we remain bullish on MDT shares,” Wood summed up.Bullish means an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and a $104 price target that points toward a 27% one-year upside potential. (To watch Wood’s track record, click here)Overall, Medtronic gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The 16 recent analyst reviews include 8 Buys, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells, while the $94.80 average price target suggests ~16% increase from the current trading price of $81.96.

Its market-leading brands, acquisition synergies and strong liquidity give it strength for solid growth potential in the long term.Strong Bottom-Line Views for 2023 &amp; Long-Term ProspectsMasco has undertaken cost-saving initiatives that target company-wide annual savings through reduction of corporate expenses and simplification of Masco’s organizational structure. It has also acquired various businesses to expand its diverse product portfolio.Backed by strong execution in the first half of 2023, the company raised its adjusted earnings expectation to $3.50-$3.65 per share from a prior projection of $3.10-$3.40. The adjusted operating margin for the year is now projected to be 16% versus 15% expected earlier. It now anticipates an adjusted operating margin of 17% for both segments, up from 16% projected earlier.On Jul 21, 2023, MAS entered into an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Sauna360 Group Oy within its Plumbing Products segment. The product portfolio of Sauna360 includes traditional, infrared and wood-burning saunas, along with steam showers. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing adjustments.The company has been witnessing strong demand for all its market-leading brands. The Behr brand is the number one brand in the do-it-yourself (DIY) market for architectural coatings. The PRO paint business continues to gain a significant share in the market. Impressively, PRO paint has a three-year run rate of approximately 70%.Recently, Masco launched adjacent paint categories like aerosols, interior stains and caulks and sealants within PRO that added to the results in the first half of 2023 and are expected to continue to add benefits in 2023. The company plans to increase investments in people and capabilities in 2023.Backed by these capabilities, MAS anticipates approximately 10% average annual EPS growth and 3-5% average annual sales growth organically in the long run. On the back of a strong balance sheet position, it plans to return shareholders 1-2% above EPS growth via dividends and 2-4% through repurchases.Story continuesHere’s Why the Stock is SinkingDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, Masco’s shares plunged 1% in the past three months versus the Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry’s 2.2% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMasco has witnessed a slowdown in demand for many of its products since the second quarter of 2022. This trend is likely to continue in the rest of 2023, thanks to higher interest rates, inflationary pressure and softness in housing.Given housing delays and foreign currency headwinds, Masco expects sales to decline approximately 10%. The Plumbing segment’s sales are likely to decline year over year in the range of 10-12% compared with the prior expectation of 10-14%, including the impact of foreign currency. The Decorative Architectural segment’s sales are expected to fall year over year within the range of 8-10% compared with the previous expectation of 5-10%. Particularly within paint, DIY sales are likely to decrease in high-single-digits and PRO sales are expected to decline in mid-single-digits.The overall industry has been witnessing intense inflationary pressure over the last few quarters. The current inflation pressure and shipping delays are concerning Masco. The company expects inflation to be in low single-digit for 2023, affecting its paint raw material basket.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMAS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Some other top-ranked stocks carrying the same rank as MAS in the same space are:Installed Building Products, Inc.

The updated approach combines important features of the methodologies of S&amp;P Global Ratings and Shades of Green, providing additional transparency to investors that seek to understand and act upon potential contribution to a sustainable future.S&amp;P Global Ratings' Shades of GreenLynn Maxwell, Chief Commercial Officer at S&amp;P Global Ratings, comments: ""The launch of our revised analytical approach for SPOs, combining the best of S&amp;P Global Ratings and Shades of Green, is an important step as we strive to provide transparency to the growing sustainable bond market, which is expected to reach $900 billion-$1 trillion this year. S&amp;P Global Ratings' SPOs provide customers and the wider market the benefits of a rigorous, transparent, science-based approach that includes an instantly comprehensible Shades of Green assessment.""In the updated analytical approach, S&amp;P Global Ratings outlines its process for providing SPOs, defines an S&amp;P Global Ratings Shade of Green and explains how it is assigned to environmental projects. In addition, it contextualizes how a sustainable finance project contributes to addressing what we consider to be the issuer's most material sustainability factors, as well as its management of additional considerations relevant to the sustainable financing. The integrated analysis produces four analytical outputs:Alignment assessment: examines whether a financing's documentation aligns with certain third-party published sustainable finance principles and guidelines identified by the issuer;Shade of green: for green projects, opines on how consistent an economic activity or financial investment is with a low-carbon, climate resilient future;Issuer sustainability context: opines on how the financing contributes to addressing what S&amp;P Global Ratings considers to be the issuer's most material sustainability factors;EU Taxonomy assessment: provides an assessment of a financing's alignment with the EU taxonomy, upon request from an issuer.Story continuesSPOs are independent assessments of a company's financing or framework's alignment with market standards and are typically provided before any borrowing is raised. They are not credit ratings, do not consider credit quality, and do not factor into S&amp;P Global Ratings' credit ratings.S&amp;P Global Ratings analysts will present the updated methodology in a freely accessible webinar.

This move is part of a trend for the insider, who over the past year has sold a total of 37,961 shares and purchased none.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with QCOM. Click here to check it out. QCOM 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of QCOMJames Thompson is a key figure at Qualcomm Inc, a company that is a world leader in 3G, 4G, and next-generation wireless technologies. Qualcomm's technologies are used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment, consumer electronic devices, and other connected devices. Thompson's role as CTO places him in a strategic position within the company, making his stock transactions particularly noteworthy.The insider transaction history for Qualcomm Inc shows a trend towards selling rather than buying. Over the past year, there have been 10 insider sells and no insider buys. This trend is illustrated in the following image:Insider Sell: Qualcomm Inc's CTO James Thompson Sells 27,962 SharesOn the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Qualcomm Inc were trading for $113.23 apiece, giving the stock a market cap of $127.08 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 14.92, which is lower than both the industry median of 23.96 and the companys historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers and its own historical performance.The GF Value, an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, further supports this assessment. With a price of $113.23 and a GuruFocus Value of $151.91, Qualcomm Inc has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.75. This indicates that the stock is modestly undervalued. The GF Value is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value for Qualcomm Inc is shown in the following image:Insider Sell: Qualcomm Inc's CTO James Thompson Sells 27,962 SharesThe insider's decision to sell shares could be influenced by a variety of factors. It's important to note that insider selling does not necessarily indicate a negative outlook for the company. Insiders may sell shares for personal reasons or to diversify their investment portfolio. However, the trend of insider selling at Qualcomm Inc is worth monitoring for potential implications for the stock's future performance.In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell and the trend of insider selling at Qualcomm Inc may raise questions, the stock's current valuation suggests it is modestly undervalued. Investors should consider these factors along with the company's fundamentals and market conditions when making investment decisions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $1.91 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -39%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -33.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.13 indicates a change of +9.9% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $8.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25.3%. The $35.69 billion and $37.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.3% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $8.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.7%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $2.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.51 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.31%.Over the last four quarters, Qualcomm surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

192,2c214d9f-7a06-340f-84bc-f23643329dbf,PHM,2023-09-15,5 Low-Leverage Stocks to Buy as U.S. Consumer Price Rises,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-leverage-stocks-buy-124100830.html,1694695260,STORY,"['KEX', 'ALE', 'ACA', 'TEX', 'PHM']","[The majority of U.S. stock indices finished in the green on Sep 13, after August consumer price data reflected a moderate rise. This boosted investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve might leave interest rates unchanged this month.Against this backdrop, stock market players might be in the mood for some good investment. However, since the share market has lately been on the edge, we recommend stocks like Arcosa ACA, PulteGroup PHM, Kirby Corp. KEX, Terex Corp. TEX and Allete Inc. ALE, which bear low leverage. Choosing them can shield investors from incurring huge losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.The equity market can be volatile at times and as an investor, if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityStory continuesThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the second-quarter earnings cycle behind us, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen.Arcosa: The company is a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions with leading brands serving construction, engineered structures and transportation markets.

It is desperately-needed by South Africa, where the infectious disease is the leading cause of death, killing more than 50,000 people in 2021. South Africa has more than 7 million people living with HIV, more than any other country in the world. The World Health Organization says that nearly one-third of deaths among people who have HIV/AIDS are due to tuberculosis.Globally, TB cases increased in 2021 for the first time in years, according to the WHO.J&amp;J has previously faced calls to drop its prices for bedaquiline and said last month that it would provide a six-month course of the drug for one patient through the Stop TB Partnerships Global Drug Facility at a cost of $130.The South African government purchases its bedaquiline directly from J&amp;J and Janssen and not through the Stop TB facility and was paying around $280 for a six-month course for a patient, according to Professor Norbert Ndjeka, who leads the national department of health's TB control and management.Story continuesNdjeka said that South Africa had recently concluded a new two-year deal with J&amp;J for bedaquiline at a slightly higher price than $280 per course, according to a report on the News24 website.The Competition Commission said it was confirming the investigation due to heightened media interest, but would not respond to requests for comment or more information about the probe.It comes a week after a health advocacy group released details of South Africa's COVID-19 vaccine purchase contracts with numerous pharmaceutical companies, including J&amp;J and U.S.-based Pfizer. They were obtained after the group, the Health Justice Intiative, won a freedom of information case in court.The group says the contracts show J&amp;J charged South Africa 15% more per vaccine dose than it charged the much richer European Union. Pfizer charged South Africa more than 30% more per vaccine than it charged the African Union, even as South Africa struggled to acquire doses while having more COVID-19 infections than anywhere else on the continent.In the contract, South Africa was required to pay Pfizer $40 million in advance for doses, with only $20 million refundable if the vaccines weren't delivered, the Health Justice Initiative said. J&amp;J also required a non-refundable downpayment of $27.5 million.Pfizer reported record revenues of $100.3 billion in 2022. J&amp;J made $94.9 billion in sales last year.___AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa]"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) , and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). These companies are known to perform well by serving their stakeholders to position themselves well in their respective industries. Let’s take a look at all of them.Apple Inc.

On August 19, the company reported some of its employee empowerment programs where it mentioned that its Career Choice program covers tuition fees for its employees enrolled in associate degrees, professional certifications, or bachelor’s degrees in addition to providing mentoring and career counseling. This depicts a deep level of concern and understanding for employees.Now that we have taken a look at the most renowned companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and some efforts that make them admirable, let's examine the most admired companies in 2023.25 Most Admired Companies in 2023Copyright: yuliufu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyIn order to create a list of the 25 most admired companies in the world, we reviewed the Fortune most admired companies for 2023. Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

Kenvue is also a defendant in one of the lawsuits.Story continuesIn a statement on Friday, Johnson &amp; Johnson said: ""Johnson &amp; Johnson is not named in the lawsuits, which makes sense because it did not manufacture or sell decongestant cold medicines and, following our separation, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc is not a part of Johnson &amp; Johnson.""Kenvue declined to comment.

The new look, which includes a different shade of red, aims to recognize J&amp;J’s shift into a “pure play health care company,” said Vanessa Broadhurst, a company executive vice president.The signature logo was “one of the longest-used company emblems in the world,” J&amp;J declared in a 2017 website post.But it started showing its age in an era of texting and emojis.Many children no longer learn to write cursive in school, noted marketing consultant Laura Ries. People may recognize the signature, but they weren’t necessarily reading it, she said. The new logo, she said, is easier to process.“Because it’s easier, it almost even draws your attention to it,” said Ries, who wasn't involved in the logo change.Ries also noted people likely identified the script logo more with the Kenvue products they see on drugstore shelves, such as Band-Aids, Listerine and Tylenol.“Everyone washed their baby with Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo,” she said.A Kenvue spokesperson said the J&amp;J branding on products like Band Aids will gradually be removed.The signature logo also could be found on bottles of the company’s now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder, which generated lawsuits alleging that it caused cancer. J&amp;J has insisted that the powder was safe.The consumer business helped J&amp;J become the world’s biggest health care products maker, with annual sales topping $90 billion. But its pharmaceutical and medical device divisions had easily surpassed it in size when the spinoff was announced in late 2021.Story continuesNew Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&amp;J also said Thursday that it will relabel its Janssen pharmaceutical business Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovative Medicine.

202,2d41fb49-c874-3ccd-8c9b-1b5bfaca4885,MDT,2023-09-15,‘Vintage Values’: Morgan Stanley Says These Are the Top Stocks for a One-Year Buy-and-Hold Investment Horizon — Here’s What Makes Them Stand Out,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vintage-values-morgan-stanley-says-005142202.html,1694739102,STORY,"['MS', 'MDT', 'NEE']","[A smart investor is a patient investor, in the game for the long haul. Warren Buffett, a legend in the markets, has long been known for advocating long-term holdings – and so does the banking giant Morgan Stanley. The bank’s annual ‘Vintage Values’ report points out the firm’s top stocks for a ‘buy-and-hold’ strategy on the one-year horizon.The current Vintage Values list has a lot to say on the subject, but a few features of their picks stand out. First, all of their choices are mid- or large-cap stocks. Second, their Vintage Values selections lean strongly towards high-quality names. And finally, these names are trading at a bargain compared to the market.There’s one more important point to make about Morgan Stanley’s Vintage Value list. Since they started publishing these picks 14 years ago, the list has tended to outperform the S&amp;P 500. The 2022-2023 list, the predecessor of this one, beat the index by 941 basis points over 12 months.So let’s see just what Morgan Stanley says investors should buy and hold. Here are two of the firm’s Vintage Values.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE)The first Vintage Value pick we’re looking at is NextEra, a renewable energy company and an important component of the clean energy industry. NextEra has between $85 billion and $95 billion in infrastructure improvements planned for the next two years, and has 67 gigawatts of power generation in operation. NextEra is the owner of the Florida Power &amp; Light company, the largest electric utility in the US, and provides power to more than 12 million people across the state of Florida.In addition to its Florida operations, NextEra has assets in several other states, including emission-free nuclear power generation in Wisconsin and New Hampshire. The company is a leader in wind and solar power generation, and operates multiple renewable power generation facilities in Texas.All of that is good, but NextEra sees the future of power generation in the hydrogen energy sector. The company is working with US government agencies to develop and fund green hydrogen energy projects, and is investing up to $20 billion into hydrogen capital projects, with a goal to develop up to 15 gigawatts of renewable hydrogen power generation by 2026.Story continuesAt the bottom line, the company’s revenues have been increasing in recent years. In the last quarterly report, for 2Q23, NextEra reported revenues of $7.35 billion, beating the estimates by $1.18 billion and increasing almost 42% year-over-year. The company’s bottom line, a non-GAAP EPS of 88 cents, was 6 cents per share better than had been expected.All of this leads Morgan Stanley’s David Arcaro to an upbeat view of the company. The analyst writes, “We remain bullish given low earnings risk, continued strong renewables demand, improving supply chain backdrop, and green hydrogen upside… Hydrogen projects will require deep skill sets across several areas where NEE has advantages. We expect NEE to be a leader in the green hydrogen market regardless of the Treasury provisions.”Arcaro’s comments back up his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on NEE, and his price target, now set at $90, suggests ~30% upside potential on the one-year timeline. (To watch Arcaro’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock has attracted 10 recent reviews from the Street, with an 8 to 2 breakdown favoring Buys over Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares’ $69.28 trading price and $84.90 average price target give the stock ~23% potential gain in the next 12 months. (See NextEra stock forecast)Medtronic PLC (MDT)The next stock we’ll look at from the Morgan Stanley Vintage Value list is Medtronic, a medical device company with a wide range of products targeting a variety of conditions. The company has a global footprint, and is a leader in healthcare technology, describing its mission as ‘attacking the most challenging health problems facing humanity.’Some basic numbers will show the scale and reach of Medtronic’s operations. The company’s products have helped more than 74 million patients over the years, and looking forward, Medtronic has more than 210 active clinical trials testing out new devices and products. In its fiscal year 2023, which ended this past April, Medtronic reported making $2.7 billion worth of R&amp;D investments, a solid indicator of confidence in its approach. And, of particular interest to return-minded investors, the company paid out $3.6 billion in dividends to its shareholders in fiscal year 2023.The dividend is worth a closer look. Medtronic has already declared its dividend for fiscal 2Q24. The payment of 69 cents per common share marks a 1-cent increase from the year-ago quarter, and will annualize to 3.4%. The company has a dividend history stretching back to the 1970s.Medtronic last reported earnings for Q1 of fiscal 2024, and showed a 4.5% year-over-year increase at the top line; the revenue figure of $7.7 billion beat the forecast by over $144 million. The company’s non-GAAP EPS, at $1.20 per share, was 9 cents better than expected. In a move that bodes well going forward, Medtronic also bumped up its earnings guidance, to the range of $5.08 to $5.16 per share, or a 7-cent increase at the midpoint. This compared favorably to the $5.05 consensus EPS guidance expectation.Looking under the hood at this stock, Morgan Stanley’s Patrick Wood lays out multiple reasons for an upbeat outlook: “We see MDT’s pipe as well stocked from the innovation standpoint (e.g. Inceptiv, 780G, Simplera, Spyral, Micra, Pulse Select etc.), and gross margins are trending in the right direction with a c. 115bps beat despite heavy S&amp;OP and supply chain work. Indeed, gross margin delivery back to c. 68% is worth c. 12% to group earnings alone, and we expect MDT to drive more consistent execution as it consolidates supply and manufacturing.”“Trading on sub 15x calendar ’24 P/E, despite what we expect to be consistent MSD organic growth and potential c. 200bps upside to margins, along with less crowded positioning, we remain bullish on MDT shares,” Wood summed up.Bullish means an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and a $104 price target that points toward a 27% one-year upside potential. (To watch Wood’s track record, click here)Overall, Medtronic gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The 16 recent analyst reviews include 8 Buys, 6 Holds, and 2 Sells, while the $94.80 average price target suggests ~16% increase from the current trading price of $81.96.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Republic Services (NYSE:RSG). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Republic Services How Fast Is Republic Services Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Republic Services has grown EPS by 15% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Republic Services maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 18% to US$14b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Republic Services' future profits.Are Republic Services Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Republic Services has a market capitalisation of US$48b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. To be specific, they have US$43m worth of shares. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 0.09%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Republic Services, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.Republic Services offered total compensation worth US$9.8m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Does Republic Services Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Republic Services is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Republic Services, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for Republic Services that you need to take into consideration.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Mosaic’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Mosaic Is Mosaic Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Mosaic is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $49.24, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Mosaic’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Mosaic look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Mosaic, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although MOS is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to MOS, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MOS for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.If you want to dive deeper into Mosaic, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Mosaic you should be mindful of and 1 of these shouldn't be ignored.If you are no longer interested in Mosaic, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

With assets including phosphate rock mines in Florida, Louisiana, Brazil, and Peru, as well as potash mines in Saskatchewan, New Mexico, and Brazil, The Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) has established a strong foothold in the agriculture industry. However, with a current stock price of $38.51, is it trading at a fair value? To answer this, we need to look at the GF Value, an estimation of the fair value of the stock.Unveiling The Mosaic Co (MOS)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is an intrinsic value of a stock derived from a unique method that takes into account historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should be traded.According to the GuruFocus Value calculation, The Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) appears to be significantly undervalued. This is based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at, the past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. With its current price of $38.51 per share and a market cap of $12.80 billion, The Mosaic Co's stock seems to be significantly undervalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling The Mosaic Co (MOS)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthIt is always important to check the financial strength of a company before buying its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength have a higher risk of permanent loss. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great way to understand the financial strength of a company. The Mosaic Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.16, which is worse than 77.18% of 241 companies in the Agriculture industry. The overall financial strength of The Mosaic Co is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of The Mosaic Co is fair.Unveiling The Mosaic Co (MOS)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. The Mosaic Co has been profitable 8 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $16.80 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of $6.33. Its operating margin of 16.46% is better than 78.21% of 234 companies in the Agriculture industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks The Mosaic Co's profitability as strong.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. The Mosaic Co's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 81.7% of 224 companies in the Agriculture industry. The Mosaic Co's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0%, which ranks worse than 0% of 214 companies in the Agriculture industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, The Mosaic Co's ROIC is 10.36 while its WACC came in at 9.15.Unveiling The Mosaic Co (MOS)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of The Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) shows every sign of being significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 0% of 214 companies in the Agriculture industry.

Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL).

(NKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-attracting-investor-130012034.html,1694696412,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned -9.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.2% change. The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, to which Nike belongs, has lost 10.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share, indicating a change of -21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.9%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.40 indicates a change of +18.5% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $53.64 billion and $58.24 billion estimates indicate +6% and +8.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.8%. EPS of $0.66 for the same period compares with $0.90 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.83%. The EPS surprise was -1.49%.Over the last four quarters, Nike surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Santomassimo noted, “We had too much real estate before Covid, and so we’ve been methodically working through that portfolio over the last few years.”With the macroeconomic uncertainty, banks’ exposure to commercial real estate loans has been worrisome, particularly in office loans, due to slow return to office. Wells Fargo's management noted that its portfolios other than office lending have been performing well, reducing the pressure in its commercial real estate portfolio.WFC also remarked that quarter to date, loans have dipped slightly and the company has stepped back from auto originations. With the asset cap remaining in place until it complies fully with regulators’ demands regarding compliance and operational risk management, Wells Fargo’s loan balance is not likely to improve much. This is likely to hamper net interest income growth.Nonetheless, the company has continued its share repurchase activity in the third quarter, although at a slower pace than in the first half of 2023.The company enjoys a strong liquidity position, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 123% as of the second-quarter 2023 end, which has been above its regulatory minimum of 100%. Its liquid assets (including cash and due from banks, as well as interest-earning deposits with banks) totaled $155.33 billion as of the same date.

It is desperately-needed by South Africa, where the infectious disease is the leading cause of death, killing more than 50,000 people in 2021. South Africa has more than 7 million people living with HIV, more than any other country in the world. The World Health Organization says that nearly one-third of deaths among people who have HIV/AIDS are due to tuberculosis.Globally, TB cases increased in 2021 for the first time in years, according to the WHO.J&amp;J has previously faced calls to drop its prices for bedaquiline and said last month that it would provide a six-month course of the drug for one patient through the Stop TB Partnerships Global Drug Facility at a cost of $130.The South African government purchases its bedaquiline directly from J&amp;J and Janssen and not through the Stop TB facility and was paying around $280 for a six-month course for a patient, according to Professor Norbert Ndjeka, who leads the national department of health's TB control and management.Story continuesNdjeka said that South Africa had recently concluded a new two-year deal with J&amp;J for bedaquiline at a slightly higher price than $280 per course, according to a report on the News24 website.The Competition Commission said it was confirming the investigation due to heightened media interest, but would not respond to requests for comment or more information about the probe.It comes a week after a health advocacy group released details of South Africa's COVID-19 vaccine purchase contracts with numerous pharmaceutical companies, including J&amp;J and U.S.-based Pfizer. They were obtained after the group, the Health Justice Intiative, won a freedom of information case in court.The group says the contracts show J&amp;J charged South Africa 15% more per vaccine dose than it charged the much richer European Union. Pfizer charged South Africa more than 30% more per vaccine than it charged the African Union, even as South Africa struggled to acquire doses while having more COVID-19 infections than anywhere else on the continent.In the contract, South Africa was required to pay Pfizer $40 million in advance for doses, with only $20 million refundable if the vaccines weren't delivered, the Health Justice Initiative said. J&amp;J also required a non-refundable downpayment of $27.5 million.Pfizer reported record revenues of $100.3 billion in 2022.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc.

Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

They are part of a council of leaders affiliated with Welcome.US, a group dedicated to helping support refugees in the United States.They were meeting with Zients and other White House officials ""to discuss specific ways we can continue to work together to support safe, orderly pathways for people in need of safety to come to the United States, including through refugee resettlement and new, expanded humanitarian sponsorship programs,"" a White House official told Reuters ahead of the meeting.Gap CEO Richard Dickson, Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, Lyft Inc CEO David Risher, Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya, and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert also attended, along with representatives from Airbnb, Goldman Sachs, Meta and others.The White House said after the meeting that the officials and executives discussed long-term needs of refugees but also solutions to immediate ones, including providing credits for ride-share services and money for public transportation, increasing offers of pro bono legal services, and helping people eligible to work to get jobs.They also talked about mentorship working with communities to sponsor and welcome refugees, it said.""Today’s meeting highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in building durable and scalable capacity to better respond to the global displacement crisis,"" the White House said in a statement.New York Governor Kathy Hochul met Zients and other senior administration officials last month to discuss an influx of migrants in New York City that has strained its resources.Story continuesRepublicans have hammered Biden, a Democrat, for his policies on immigration, and the issue is likely to feature prominently in the 2024 presidential campaign, when Biden, who is running for re-election, is likely to face former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination and an immigration hardliner.Biden sought at the beginning of his administration to recast the U.S. immigration system, but appetite in Congress for comprehensive reform legislation has been low.The White House, which says it wants to partner with the private sector to build a humane immigration system, worked with Welcome.US to help Afghan refugees coming to the United States after Biden pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.Welcome.US and its CEO Council have worked with the administration to ""implement the largest expansion of humanitarian sponsorship pathways to safety in the United States in recent history,"" a representative for the group said.

237,2beed50f-d9fa-3394-b5ec-28a51b0bdb0c,PFE,2023-09-15,Novo Nordisk (NVO) Announces Stock Split to Enhance Liquidity,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisk-nvo-announces-stock-152800843.html,1694705280,STORY,"['NOVO-B.CO', 'NVO', 'LLY', 'PFE']","[Novo Nordisk’s NVO board of directors has approved a split of the trading units of the company’s class B shares and American Depositary Receipts (“ADR”) listed on the Nasdaq Copenhagen and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) in a two-for-one ratio.In a two-for-one split, each share before the stock split will now turn into two shares after the split.Novo Nordisk has already conducted a two-for-one stock split of its class B shares listed on the Nasdaq Copenhagen as of Sep 13. The split in the ADRs will take effect from Sep 20 to maintain a one-to-one relationship between the B-share and ADR.The decision was expected as NVO had previously announced its plans for a stock split alongside its second-quarter 2023 results. This split is also the company’s first one since 2014.A stock split is done to lower a single share's price, making the company's stock more affordable without losing value. This decision does not impact a company’s total market capitalization.However, in Novo’s case, the stock split is hardly expected to contribute to liquidity. As of Sep 13, each ADR of the company traded under $200 per unit – a price most investors are likely to pay willingly. Lowering the price via a stock split does not guarantee bringing more investors.In the year so far, shares of Novo Nordisk have surged 42.3% compared with the industry’s 9.0% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis upside in the share price is attributable to Novo Nordisk’s popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy (semaglutide).A GLP-1 receptor agonist, Wegovy, is approved for use in individuals aged 12 years and above in the United States and Europe for weight management in people living with obesity.Since its launch, sales of Wegovy have been gaining momentum. Wegovy sales were up 543% in second-quarter 2023.The increasing demand trend of Wegovy is both a boon and a bane for this Danish pharma company. On the one hand, Novo Nordisk raised its full-year 2023 sales outlook and profit expectations based on the sales upside. On the other hand, the company is struggling to meet demand outside the United States, even with increased production capacity.Story continuesIf the supply issues continue to prevail for an extended period, it could result in the loss of market share for the company in the presence of other pharma bigwigs like Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFE, which have also developed their obesity drugs.In June, Lilly announced that it had completed the regulatory submission seeking label expansion for its dual GIP/GLP-1-RA drug tirzepatide to treat obesity or overweight in adults. A final decision is expected by 2023-end. The Eli Lilly drug has also shown a superior weight-loss reduction in multiple late-stage clinical studies.Lilly’s tirzepatide was approved in May 2022 for treating adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (“T2DM”) and is being marketed under the brand name Mounjaro. Since its launch, Mounjaro has shown an impressive initial uptake, recording $980 million in revenues in second-quarter 2023. An expansion in the obesity indication would help Lilly rake in billions of dollars from Mounjaro sales.Pfizer is also evaluating pipeline candidates for obesity. Pfizer is currently evaluating danuglipron in a phase II study in patients with obesity and T2DM. If this study is successful, Pfizer plans to start phase III studies by year-end.Novo Nordisk A/S Price Novo Nordisk A/S PriceNovo Nordisk A/S price | Novo Nordisk A/S Quote Zacks RankNovo Nordisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the cryptocurrency market, you can go directly to see 5 Countries with the Highest Cryptocurrency Ownership.According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $4.67 billion in 2022. The global cryptocurrency market is expected to grow to $11.71 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 12.5%. The cryptocurrency market is gaining immense popularity across the globe. Increasing adoption of ledger distributed technology and widening acceptance of crypto as a credible payment method have contributed to the industry’s growth.According to the report, the Asia Pacific is expected to experience the highest compound annual growth rate in the forecast years from 2023 to 2030. This is primarily due to the rising awareness of crypto and increasing investment in blockchain technology in China, Japan, and South Korea.A Rising Crypto Startup Amidst Stringent RegulationsWhat does the future look like for the crypto industry? This is an interesting question for cryptocurrency holders and crypto companies alike. Do the bans limit the crypto industry's growth, or do investments by large companies in crypto paint a rosy picture countering any adverse impact by bans?On September 6, Forbes discussed the recent regulations against crypto in Australia. Australia's Senate Economics Legislation Committee recently rejected the Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill. The bill propagated establishing licensing systems for crypto exchange, custody services, and stablecoin issuers. This not only prevents crypto companies from expanding in Australia but also hampers people from participating in the digital asset economy. On September 7, Reuters reported that Britain's Financial Conduct Authority is set to establish stringent rules against marketing cryptocurrencies by early October. However, for the moment, the state has allowed companies to navigate their way through the regulations by enabling them to apply for a 24-hour cooling-off period. The state is set to implement these rules to protect British citizens from the illegal sale and marketing of crypto assets by firms around the world. The penalty for going against the new regulations could result in unlimited fines and up to two years in prison. Story continuesAcceptance demands time. Such is the case with crypto. While governments continue to navigate through the industry, companies and startups are on their way to becoming global leaders.On July 24, Forbes discussed a crypto startup on its way to deanonymize blockchain. Miguel Morel is a 23-year-old running his very own startup, Arkham's Intelligence. The startup is an Austin-based startup revolutionizing blockchain data. Miguel insists that, eventually, people will have to stop hiding behind anonymous users on cryptocurrency marketplaces. Arkham's Intelligence is an online marketplace operating as a platform to buy and sell information. This information is based on users' transaction history and personal wallet ownership.His primary goal is to establish transparency in his online systems. To shed light on this, Miguel states:""Eventually, everyone's blockchain identity will be linked to their real-world identity. My goal for the marketplace, the intel exchange, is for anybody to make requests and post information that could be very meaningful in this space, either because it provides alpha for trading and investment or because it helps with risk management, exposing some major fraud. The crypto space needs transparency and accountability. There needs to be a mechanism by which people are incentivized to share information helpful to the community. Otherwise things will continue to be in the dark.""Miguel aims to deanonymize the system by requiring users to acquire information exchange tokens. Users must pledge the amount they are willing to offer and obtain specific information for the exchange. The system allows any crypto sleuth or blockchain analyst to respond to the user. Other users are allowed to hop on the conversation and make offers. However, the offers must sum to at least the initial offer. With these offers, the first person to be able to access the requested data will receive tokens as a bounty. The model is still in its early stages and has a long way to go.Startups are making efforts to enhance the dynamics of the industry. However, large companies are also playing their part in increasing the use of crypto worldwide.Notable Names in the Crypto MarketHow important is it for large companies to take significant actions for the development of the industry? Large established companies operate through a wide consumer and supplier network. These companies hold the power and ability to enhance the workings of industries through continuous investments in research and development. Such companies include Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Check out some of the best cryptocurrency stocks.Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is a cryptocurrency exchange platform based in the United States. On August 17, the company reported that Coinbase received approval from the National Future Association to offer cryptocurrency futures trading to retail customers. This will enable Coinbase to become the first Crypto native leader. The company will now be the first to offer regulated, leveraged and cash-settled crypto futures. Such will maximize customer convenience by enabling them access to futures directly through the Coinbase Financial Market.CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a leading derivatives marketplace. On August 15, the company reported to launch APAC reference rates for Bitcoin and Ethereum on September 11. These new reference rates for the two digital assets will allow more people from the region to participate in the growing digital space while meeting the needs of existing participants. Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME Group said:""These new reference rates are designed to meet the ever-evolving needs of global participants in the growing digital asset space. Year-to-date, 37% of the total crypto volume at CME Group has been traded during non-U.S. hours, with 11% of trades coming from the APAC region. As we continue to see more institutional clients use our Bitcoin and Ether futures products in active portfolios or structured products like ETFs, these APAC reference rates will allow market participants to more accurately and precisely hedge cryptocurrency price risk with timing more closely aligned to their portfolios.""On August 7, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported the launch of the US dollar Stablecoin. US dollar deposits and short-term treasuries will back the stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD). Consumers purchasing the digital asset can transfer the coin to any compatible wallet, exercise purchases, and convert cryptocurrencies to PayPal USD and vice versa. The company believes the need to catch up with changing global financial trends is significant to uphold the digital future. To shed light on this, the CEO and President of PayPal, Dan Schulman, stated:""The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the US dollar. Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.""Companies heavily contribute to the widespread acceptance of crypto as a credible digital payment. The greater the company's investment in the industry, the more likely people will develop trust in digital assets.

IBM watsonx offers a unified platform that enables AI developers to train, fine-tune and tailor AI models per business-specific requirements. Leveraging the right AI will enable ESPN to transform structured and unstructured football data into valuable insights. This will empower fantasy team owners to make more informed decisions when they set up their match-day lineups.Fantasy app uses a feature called ‘waiver wire,’ a system used to manage player rosters and transactions. The waiver wire feature enables fantasy team managers to acquire players who were released by other teams or not initially drafted. At the end of every week, managers often choose to reevaluate and shuffle their squad for the upcoming match. The players released from the team during this process become available on the waiver wire.When several requests are submitted to acquire the same player, determining who ultimately gets the player can be complicated. Waiver Wire simplifies this whole procedure by adding an element of fairness and strategy to player acquisitions during the season.New features incorporated in the app, namely, Waiver Grades will give personalized grades to each available player in the waiver by evaluating the benefits they can bring to a specific team. This allows fantasy managers to assess the potential player's grade in comparison to the average grade of players who are already on their squad for the same position.Additionally, the Trade Grades feature provides a personalized evaluation of the trade. The advanced AI capabilities utilized in conjunction with machine learning models effectively analyze each player’s performance every week and offer unbiased insights. The AI-generated classifications allow fantasy managers to better evaluate players’ worth and make smarter decisions.By introducing these enticing features leveraging IBM’s advanced AI, ESPN is aiming to improve the digital experience of 11 million fantasy football users. The successful integration of IBM AI will demonstrate the versatility of IBM’s watsonx.ai and its applicability across various sectors. This will further augment IBM’s leadership position in the sphere of artificial intelligence and expand its commercial horizon.IBM is betting big on the watsonx platform, which is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI, namely, the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store, built on an open lake house architecture; and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.IBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in Software and Consulting. The company’s growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long haul. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely drive profitability.The stock has gained 16.8% over the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 10.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderMotorola Solutions, Inc.

That is because the Sep 15, 2023 $50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Molson Coors shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Molson Coors is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Beverages - Alcohol industry that ranks in the Bottom 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.50 per share to $1.52 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Molson Coors right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

""The rest of us will keep organizing and support them on the picket line.”This is part of the UAW's ""stand up"" strategy, in which only a portion of the 147,000 UAW members strike at select plants, and all at once. In this case, around 13,000 UAW members will strike at GM's Wentzville, Mo., plant (which assembles midsize trucks and full-size vans), Stellantis' Toledo Assembly (Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator), and Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne (Ranger midsize pickup and Bronco SUV).United Auto Workers members walk in the Labor Day parade in Detroit on Sept. 4, 2023. (Paul Sancya/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The UAW says as time goes on, more locals may be called on to join the strike, giving what the UAW says is “maximum leverage and maximum flexibility” in negotiations with the automakers.Meanwhile, other chapters that have not been called to strike will keep working. This allows the UAW to keep its $825 million “strike fund” going as long as possible while the union pursues its strategy of striking all three automakers in a select way. ""We're going to hit where we need to hit,"" UAW president Shawn Fain said.The UAW will pay striking workers $500 a week to cover costs and expenses, while the other UAW members who continue working will collect wages and be able to contribute to the strike fund. The UAW members who continue to work will do so under an expired contract, which will be allowed by the union.Story continuesPresident Biden weighed in on the strike on Friday, supporting UAW efforts to secure what he sees as fair wages. “The companies have made some significant offers, but I believe they should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW,” Biden said, and reiterated that ""we need labor agreements for the future."" Biden also dispatched Labor Secretary Julie Su and senior adviser Gene Sperling to Detroit to help guide negotiations between the union and Big Three. “It's unconventional. It's a risky strategy, and one thing is certain, as there is a law in physics that for every action there is a reaction — corporations, the companies, cannot be expected to just sit there and idly take the union striking at their whim,” labor expert Marick Masters, professor at Wayne State University's school of business, told Yahoo Finance. “[The Big Three will] respond in some sort of way to take the union's advantage away in calling strikes at their leisure.”In a statement, Ford said it finally received a substantive counterproposal from the UAW late Thursday night, but the union's offer showed ""little movement"" from the UAW's initial demands. GM CEO Mary Barra confirmed in a statement last night that the automaker put forth another improved offer, increasing pay 20% among other concessions, but the proposal was not accepted. Stellantis said in a statement it was ""extremely disappointed"" by UAW leadership’s refusal to engage in a ""responsible manner"" with contract negotiations.Ford CEO Jim Farley (L) speaks with employees at the launch of the all-new electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck at the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center on April 26, 2022 in Dearborn, Mich. (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images) (Bill Pugliano via Getty Images)Initially, the UAW asked for ""substantial wage increases"" amounting to a 46% rise over three years (though that has reportedly come down to 36%); eliminating compensation tiers for new and old workers (which the UPS Teamsters secured); restoring cost-of-living adjustments; providing a new pension plan; and reducing workweeks to 32 hours from the standard 40.UAW President Shawn Fain in Detroit, Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2023. Leaders of the UAW union are considering targeted strikes at a small number of factories run by each of Detroit’s three automakers. (Carlos Osorio/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The financial pain, even from a short strike, would be costly for autoworkers, the Big Three, and the US economy overall. Consulting firm Anderson Economic Group estimates that a strike at all Big Three automakers by the UAW could result in a $5.6 billion hit to US GDP after only 10 days, and UAW lost wages could total almost $860 million.In addition, Goldman Sachs projected that a strike at all three automakers would negatively impact quarterly annualized US GDP growth by 0.05 to 0.10 percentage points for each week the strike lasts.The length of a strike at all three automakers is unclear, though it could last for longer than the industry expects. “It could last for a long period of time,” Masters said.“I think the companies might lock out the employees and try and expedite this process, because eventually, what Shawn Fain is saying is, ‘I'm going to escalate the conflict to the point where I strike all three companies company-wide.’ If the UAW is going do that, why not lock them out now, and get to the endpoint sooner rather than later?” Masters said.The effects of a strike will not only be felt by the UAW and Big Three but also consumers at dealer lots. “In general, the strikes overall would put even more pressure on new and used car prices, which have remained near record highs in large part due to the strength of the consumer and ongoing supply issues,” CoPilot CEO Pat Ryan said to Yahoo Finance.The UAW intends to press forward with what it sees as its advantage — strong public support for the autoworkers, at least at this juncture. On Friday afternoon Fain and other UAW members and allies will hold a rally in downtown Detroit, with politicians, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, expected to join and speak on the union's behalf.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Pricing led to a significant contribution of 7.7% to organic net sales growth in the second quarter. This pricing strategy had a particularly strong impact on the North America Confectionery and Salty Snacks segments.HSY’s strength lies in its robust brand portfolio, featuring iconic names, such as Hershey's, Reese's, Hershey's Kisses, Jolly Rancher, Brookside, Sofit and Ice Breakers. These core brands continued to be strong in the second quarter of 2023 and did incredibly well, driven by substantial investments in advertising, in-store merchandising, programming and innovation.Hershey is expecting a strong Halloween this year, knowing that customers are planning big displays. The company is well-placed to capitalize on the opportunity through effective marketing strategies. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Acquisition Strategy Bodes WellThe company has been actively pursuing acquisitions to bolster its product portfolio and diversify its revenue streams. This strategy was underscored in April 2023 when Hershey announced the acquisition of two production facilities from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing.This move aligns with Hershey's ongoing efforts to expand its presence in the popcorn production and co-packing sector. The movement not only supports continued growth of the SkinnyPop brand through supply-chain expansion but also solidifies Hershey's position in the thriving popcorn market.The company's acquisition strategy is complemented by its continuous focus on strengthening production capabilities. A noteworthy initiative in this regard is the construction of a chocolate-making facility in Hershey, PA. This facility is expected to increase its production capacity by 5% in 2023, showcasing Hershey's dedication to optimizing its network for improved output, profit margins, utilization rates and service levels.Story continuesWrapping UpHSY has been grappling with higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses for a while. In the second quarter of 2023, the company saw a year-over-year increase of 5.2% in these expenses, primarily driven by factors like wage and benefits inflation, and elevated investments in media, capabilities and technology.However, efficient pricing and brand strength place Hershey well despite cost hurdles.

The hiked dividend will be payable on Oct 12, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Sep 27.Philip Morris currently has a dividend payout of 86%, a dividend yield of 5.4% and a free cash flow yield of 5%. With an annual free cash flow return on investment of 18.7%, the increased dividend is likely to be sustainable. Dividend payouts are one of the biggest enticements for investors and Philip Morris is committed to boosting shareholders’ value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else Should You Know?Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has aided its revenues and adjusted operating income even in the face of the unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the second quarter of 2023.Serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products (RRPs). The company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 35.4% of the company’s net revenues in the second quarter of 2023. The company is well placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have inched up 1.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 0.6%.Story continuesLooking for Solid Consumer Staple Stocks?

The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.

A leader in minimally invasive care, the company is transforming how healthcare is delivered with its advanced robotic systems.The recent FDA approval of the da Vinci SP system for simple prostatectomies solidifies its role as a revolutionary force in the healthcare industry.

Even though there has been a 10% decrease in the past half-year, the latest quarterly results displayed a hopeful 10% rise in revenue to $652.4 million, slightly surpassing predictions by 0.5%. Teladoc’s collaboration with Microsoft to address clinical documentation through artificial intelligence is also a key development. This, along with the forecast that AI will constitute 11% of healthcare budgets in 2024, highlights the tactical decisions Teladoc is making.The expansion of Amazon Clinic nationwide contributed to the stock’s recent fall, but Teladoc quickly recovered with a 6% increase following the earnings beat and positive 2023 guidance. The expanded strategic partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also positions Teladoc as a powerful AI combo in the healthcare sector. AI is likely to spur healthcare deflation. As a result, Teladoc is a strong player in leveraging technology to revolutionize healthcare services.With the rise of AI in healthcare, Teladoc is positioning itself as a front-runner in the industry. Although the past quarter has declined, the company’s strategic moves are promising. Additionally, technology advancements and strong partnerships indicate a positive trajectory for the future.

It demonstrates resilience with a 6% increase in net income and an 8% rise in diluted EPS in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, it completed a lung cancer trial for Rybrevant and revised its financial outlook following the Kenvue separation. As indicated by Needham, the company’s updated guidance and the MedTech market’s anticipated 7% growth in 2023 make Johnson &amp; Johnson an undervalued healthcare stock worth considering.Moreover, the company reported an annual dividend yield of 2.97%, which is good news for investors seeking regular income. With its recent positive updates and a growing MedTech market, Johnson &amp; Johnson stands out among cheap healthcare stock picks. Despite the recent dip, its strong track record, robust dividend yield, and positive outlook for 2023 make it a compelling investment option.Pfizer (PFE)Here's How Pfizer Stock (and Pharma) Stand to Benefit From Mylan DealSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been a hot topic among the best healthcare stocks despite a rocky year-to-date return of -33%. Even though the recent earnings report showed a decline in revenue by 54.1% to $12.73 billion, net income dropped by 76.51% to $2.33 billion in July 2023. Despite these setbacks, the pharmaceutical giant remains an attractive proposition.This is especially true as Pfizer and BioNTech recently received endorsement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) panel for their updated COVID booster. They also received the EU nod for a new Omicron-adapted COVID shot.These recent endorsements are significant in the context of a global pandemic. Moreover, an EPS beat of 15.28% in June 2023 indicates that Pfizer can still deliver positive surprises.Investors looking for affordable healthcare investments might view the recent dip in Pfizer’s performance as intriguing. Despite the decrease in key financial metrics, Pfizer still plays a crucial role in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. In addition, it continues to be an essential addition to any dividend growth portfolio. Additionally, with the FDA reportedly set to clear updated COVID shots as early as Friday, significant upcoming catalysts can aid in the recovery of the stock. While the floor of this decline remains uncertain, Pfizer represents a doubling-down buying opportunity for investors aiming for long-term gains.As the world grapples with virus variants, Pfizer’s role in global health remains more critical than ever. This makes it a compelling option among cheap healthcare stock picks.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

What should U.S. borrowers know concerning where to find relief and what to avoid?Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo and Ronda Lee are joined by Student Defense Vice President and Chief Counsel Dan Zibel and Boies Schiller Flexner Partner Adam Shaw to talk about the ""predatory"" nature of many private student loan companies and the for-profit colleges that partner with them.Zibel notes many accredited universities attract potential students by promising them opportunities and easy access to funding through private loans. Shaw encourages U.S. borrowers to reassess their finances and even consider whether “bankruptcy is right for them because there may be a path there now that was not there before.”Click here to watch more of Yahoo Finance's special coverage ""Student Loans: Smarter Strategies.""Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: As we continue our deep dive into student loans and those repayments kicking in October, today we're talking about the risks to borrowers when it comes to predatory lending, loan consolidation, and refinancing. We have a panel of experts joining us. Yahoo Finance's senior reporter, Ronda Lee; Dan Zibel, Student Defense vice president; and Adam, Shaw partner at Schiller Flexner law firm who fought in the lawsuit against the student loan lender Navient and won.So obviously, a lot to get through here. Dan, I want to first start with you here because a lot of people are going to start getting inundated with offers about refinancing their loans or perhaps figuring out things to do. What are some of the biggest red flags people should watch out for when they're being approached about these loans or refinancing options?DAN ZIBEL: Yeah. I think you're exactly right that we are really seeing right now a lot of folks out there hearing from companies, predatory companies trying to-- under the guise of helping. And there's a lot of confusion right now in the student loan space driven in large part by the fact that at least federal student loans haven't been in repayment for the past three years. So there's a lot to look for.Story continuesI think the number one thing is, generally speaking, we tell people not to fall victim to people calling you and asking you for advice. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is too good to be true. And the best source of information tends to be from studentaid.gov. It is reliable, it is the United States Department of Education. At least for federal student loans, that's really the place to go to get verifiable information. But again, if it sounds too good to be true, that's typically something to be cautious of.RONDA LEE: Dan, I'm going to jump in because I know your organization has been involved in a lot of the borrower defense discharges and helping borrowers. So can we talk a little bit about how this-- when people talk about predatory lending, a lot of times it's happening with these for-profit schools. These schools that are saying come here, you'll graduate sooner, faster, quicker. We have an 80% graduation rate, and people are getting jobs, when actually, it takes them double the time.Let's break down to our viewers. What is actually happening because a lot of the discharges that we've seen from the education department has been from Westwood, College America, ITT DeVry. And I think a lot of them don't understand that one, there's the closed school discharge, and two, there's the borrower defense discharge. Can we talk about that? And also, can you jump into a little bit about the injunction that's happening too.DAN ZIBEL: Sure. There's a lot to break down there. I think most of the discharges that you're referring to with specific schools have come about based on findings that institutions, largely for-profit institutions have actually defrauded students. They lied to the students, they promised them jobs, they promised them outcomes. And in reality, they didn't deliver.And so there is a process in the law known as borrower defense, where students who went to those schools, borrowers who took out federal student loans to attend those schools can apply to get their loans forgiven from the federal government. That has been sort of a big push under the Biden administration to help those borrowers who have had that happen.In terms of the injunction that you just mentioned, there is a lawsuit pending. And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has enjoined the Department from imposing new regulations that were designed to ease the path to loan forgiveness for those borrowers. So again, sort of a long and tortured regulatory history, but the Department in 2021 undid a series of regulations imposed by then Secretary DeVos to try and ease the path for borrowers.And that's what is now getting held up in the courts where an organization that represents for-profit colleges has sued to enjoin those rules. And essentially, what they're trying to do is make it harder for borrowers who have been victimized by some of these schools to get relief.RONDA LEE: Adam, can you hop in here? You just recently settled a lawsuit with one of the major loan servicers. Well, former loan servicers. So they were a former loan servicer for the Department of Education, but they also offered private student loans. Can you talk about what happened with your settlement agreement?ADAM SHAW: Right. Thank you. We're talking about private student loans, not loans from the government. And Navient was collecting on these loans even after people had gone through bankruptcy. For a very long time, people did not realize, in fact, the judges and the courts and lawyers, everybody thought that student loans of all stripes persist through bankruptcy.But in fact, certain private student loans do not persist through bankruptcy. And we brought a lawsuit to try to stop Navient from collecting on those loans for thousands of people. And we're successful. We've got a settlement.Now that discharges the debts for people who went through bankruptcy and who had private student loans that either they went to a non-accredited school or where their loan exceeded the cost of attendance. So it's helpful to a number of students. Not everybody has gone through bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is not necessarily a choice for everybody. But for those that did, we've got the bankruptcy code working now.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Adam, I mean, it has been tough because undue hardship is the bar that you basically have to reach in order to qualify for this. But for people who are interested or trying to decide between discharging their loans, what should they know? What are the steps they should take?ADAM SHAW: So it's important. So for federal loans, typically, they cannot be discharged at bankruptcy unless you could show undue hardship. And for years, that was an impossible threshold to reach. More recently, the Department of Education and Department of Justice have taken the position that you could actually show that if you can't pay the loan in the future and you have stresses on you financially, that you might be able to discharge that loan through bankruptcy.So there's now an Avenue and a path for even federal loans that was not there before for people. So I think people really need to take a look at their personal situation. And if bankruptcy is right for them, there may be a path now that was not there before.RONDA LEE: Dan, I'm going to direct this question to you, and I'm going to piggyback off something that Adam mentioned. He talked about non-accredited schools. And when it comes to a lot of these for-profit schools, something that happened last year was the accrediting body was actually disbanded by the Department of Education.And so you have a lot of these schools that are offering programs that actually aren't accredited for their state or for what they're doing. Can you go into a little bit about how this contributes to the whole predatory defrauding for most of the students that have gone to these for-profit schools?DAN ZIBEL: Sure. I mean, accreditation is one of the key guardrails that Congress has required of institutions of higher education. And in reality with respect to the federal loan system, schools are actually aren't eligible to even participate in the federal loan system or the Pell Grant system unless they are accredited.And one of the long time accreditors for-profit education, an organization known as ACICS was actually essentially recognized as a legitimate accreditor by the US Department of Education. And that is one thing we tell folks is you should definitely check to see about accreditation status of a school, particularly if it is not one where it's a sort of a growth of a boot camp industry where they're not participating in the student loan programs. And you just want to make sure that there's some check on it.But I also want to just note that schools can be accredited, and it's not just even for-profit schools who were seeing some of the problems. There's been a real uptick in recent years of legitimate even highly prestigious institutions offering programs in partnership with some for-profit companies where they are essentially outsourcing the entire education. So you think you're getting an education from XYZ university that's really a top tier internationally known university, when in reality what you're getting is sort of they're licensing their name.So it's really something that even though that institution is accredited that we encourage people to really do due diligence on some of the programs, particularly some of the programs that are out there that seem a little newer or more flexible. And many of them are excellent. Don't get me wrong. But there are certainly some products out there that really are designed primarily for revenue for the institution and perhaps the company that they're in partnership with.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, due diligence certainly the key there. Appreciate you breaking this down for us. A big thank you to Dan Zibel, Student Defense vice president, and Adam Shaw, partner at Schiller Flexner law firm, and of course, Yahoo Finance's own Ronda Lee. Thank you to you all.]"

We invite readers to journey with us as we unravel the financial intricacies of WestRock Co.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with WRK. Click here to check it out. WRK 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WRKWestRock Co, a major player in the packaging industry, specializes in the manufacturing of corrugated and consumer packaging. It emerged as the largest North American producer of solid bleached sulfate and the second-largest producer of containerboard following the merger of RockTenn and MeadWestvaco in 2015. With its stock priced at $36.88 and a market cap of $9.50 billion, it's crucial to compare this with the GF Value, a proprietary measure of the stock's fair value. This comparison will lay the groundwork for an in-depth analysis of the company's valuation.WestRock Co (WRK): A Closer Look at Its Modest UndervaluationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique valuation method that calculates the intrinsic value of a stock. It considers historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.WestRock Co (NYSE:WRK), at its current price of $36.88 per share, appears to be modestly undervalued. This is based on the GF Value, which considers historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. Given its modest undervaluation, the long-term return of WestRock Co's stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesWestRock Co (WRK): A Closer Look at Its Modest UndervaluationLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to evaluate its financial strength. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are reliable indicators of a company's financial strength. WestRock Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.04, ranking lower than 88.71% of 372 companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in CSX's (NASDAQ:CSX) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for CSX:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$6.0b ÷ (US$41b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, CSX has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Transportation industry average of 12% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for CSX roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for CSX compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCECSX is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 29% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To sum it up, CSX is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 36% to shareholders. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.If you want to continue researching CSX, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.While CSX may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

In the past 30 days, earnings estimate has recorded downward revision of 4% to $9.81 per share.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that are affecting this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company.Primary ConcernsThe company’s growth is hindered by dismal contract sales due to a notable decline in volumes per guest (VPG), especially in legacy-Vistana sites. The hospitality industry is cyclical and worsening global economic conditions might dent Marriott Vacations’ revenues and profits. Consumer demand for services is closely linked to the performance of general economy, and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels.Despite cost synergies from the ILG acquisition, VAC has been bearing the brunt of steep expenses. During second-quarter 2023, total expenses rose 4.8% year over year to $1,003 million from $957 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Escalated marketing and sales expenses, and rental costs affected total expenditures. Management anticipates inflationary environment to affect margins for some time. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Dismal contract sales remain a major concern. During the second quarter of 2023, contract sales dipped 10% year over year to $453 million. The downside was caused by larger-than-expected VPG declines, particularly at the legacy-Vistana sites. Attributes such as continued transition to Abound by Marriott Vacations program and the integration of Hyatt and legacy-Welk business models and sales processes added to the downside.For 2023, VAC expects contract sales to be between $1.84 billion and $1.9 billion, down approximately 5% from the previous guidance. Although Management envisions sequential improvements in VPG, it is likely to decline on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

269,be03d86c-a124-3920-89a8-7267ee6d03a2,ADI,2023-09-15,"Analog Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ADI) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-140016522.html,1694700016,STORY,['ADI'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) recent performance, when its stock has declined 7.1% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Analog Devices'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:10% = US$3.8b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 10% ROETo start with, Analog Devices' ROE looks acceptable. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 15%. Still, we can see that Analog Devices has seen a remarkable net income growth of 21% over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Analog Devices' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 31% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Analog Devices fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Analog Devices Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Analog Devices' significant three-year median payout ratio of 67% (where it is retaining only 33% of its income) suggests that the company has been able to achieve a high growth in earnings despite returning most of its income to shareholders.Additionally, Analog Devices has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 38% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 13%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we feel that Analog Devices certainly does have some positive factors to consider. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty decent, we do feel that the reinvestment rate is pretty low. Meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher, had the company been retaining more of its profits. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Visa Inc. V and HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. HIVE.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Crypto Stocks in Focus as Interest Hike Fears WaneThe cryptocurrency market has made a solid rebound this year after an unimpressive 2022. The Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike campaign last year to combat multi-decade high inflation impacted all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Dogecoin and Litecoin.However, cryptocurrencies saw rangebound trading in August as multiple macroeconomic factors, including uncertainty over the Fed’s future course of action with its monetary tightening campaign, have made investors scramble for direction.In fact, Bitcoin price, which touched $31,500 in early July, has since retreated and was hovering around the $25,000 mark almost throughout August.However, on Sep 13, Bitcoin price once again surpassed the psychological level of $26,000, while Ethereum was trading at $1,615.4551.September is historically one of the worst months for markets but cryptocurrencies have so far shown resilience this time. The rebound comes on soaring optimism that the Fed might keep its interest rates unchanged in its September FOMC meeting.Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Fed officials are now discussing whether further rate hikes are required this year as inflation has sharply declined over the past 12 months.The Fed increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, taking its benchmark interest to the range of 5.25-5.5%. The aggressive stance has seen inflation decline to more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.Story continuesHistorically, the price of Bitcoin has exhibited a notable correlation with the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This correlation exists because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are considered to be relatively risky assets, leading investors to respond in a similar manner when evaluating their investment strategies based on prevailing market conditions. Thus, a pause in rate hikes bodes well for the cryptocurrency market in the near term.Stocks in FocusNVIDIA Corp. is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 7.88, the question arises: is Visa's stock modestly undervalued? This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Visa's valuation and invites you to delve into the subsequent sections for a deeper understanding.A Snapshot of Visa IncV 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VVisa Inc (NYSE:V) is the world's largest payment processor, having processed over $14 trillion in total volume in fiscal 2022. Operating in over 200 countries and capable of processing transactions in over 160 currencies, Visa's robust systems can handle over 65,000 transactions per second. With a current share price of $241.38, Visa boasts a market cap of $502 billion. When compared to its GF Value of $290.82, it appears that Visa's stock is modestly undervalued.Visa (V): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Financial Services IndustryUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's fair value. The stock price typically fluctuates around this line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, and its future return will likely be higher.Considering these factors, Visa appears to be modestly undervalued. Therefore, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Visa (V): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Financial Services IndustryExamining Visa's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Visa has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.91, ranking better than 67% of 503 companies in the Credit Services industry. The overall financial strength of Visa is 7 out of 10, indicating a fair financial condition.Story continuesVisa (V): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Financial Services IndustryProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have consistently shown profitability over the long term offer less risk for investors. Visa has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. It has a revenue of $31.80 billion and an EPS of $7.88. Its operating margin is 67.04%, ranking better than 88.92% of 379 companies in the Credit Services industry. Overall, Visa's profitability is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Visa is 10.7%, ranking better than 64.43% of 492 companies in the Credit Services industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 8.9%, which ranks better than 52.67% of 281 companies in the Credit Services industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another method of determining its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Visa's ROIC is 25.5, and its WACC is 10.07.Visa (V): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Financial Services IndustryConclusionIn conclusion, Visa's stock appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 52.67% of 281 companies in the Credit Services industry.

Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024.

Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

281,1e6ae225-92dc-39b4-ac00-f5dc967160bc,MAR,2023-09-15,MAR or H: Which Hotel Stock is Better Placed at the Moment?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mar-h-hotel-stock-better-152000599.html,1694704800,STORY,"['H', 'MAR']","[Although most hoteliers are witnessing strong leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, a sequential fall in occupancy and RevPAR are roadblocks.Per STR, the U.S. hotel industry’s occupancy for the week ended Sep 2, 2023, came in at 64.1% compared with 65% for the week ended Aug 26. During this duration, RevPAR for U.S. hotels came in at $94.38 compared with $97.62 in the previous week. Industry experts believe that changes in travel patterns (due to high overseas vacationing) and expense pressure from elevated restaurant, hotel, and flight costs added to the downside.Nevertheless, companies have improved their market prospects and expedited growth by broadening their focus on franchise business models and customer reach. The initiative strengthens the business delivery engine and provides a platform for ancillary revenue growth opportunities.Also, hotel owners continue to leverage technology to maximize hotel profitability while driving guest satisfaction. Attributes involving the launch of new reservations, loyalty and property management platforms make it an initiative placed in the right direction. Year to date, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has gained 20.6% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.6% growth.The banking environment in the United States and Europe has been challenging due to rising interest rates. Financing conditions in these regions have been challenging, with some banks waiting for more clarity on capital requirements and potential regulations. Hotel operators are cautious in this regard as further challenges pave the path for the inability to access cash and the threat of new financing arrangements. This could impact the expansion deals falling through the pipeline.Meanwhile, leading hotel companies — Marriott International, Inc. MAR and Hyatt Hotels Corporation H — are undertaking different initiatives to generate profits. With both companies carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let’s analyze and find out which is poised better concerning different parameters. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesPrice Performance and ValuationZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Marriott have gained 34.5% so far this year, while Hyatt has increased 15.6%. Shares of Marriott are benefiting from robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends. Also, substantial revenue per available room growth in international markets added to the positives. Also, increased focus on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well. Going forward, the company anticipates business and group travel demand to strengthen and serve as a catalyst for its portfolio.The P/E ratio is considered for the evaluation of a stock. Typically, stocks with high P/E are overvalued, while those with low P/E are undervalued. However, this metric disregards the company's growth rate. Hence, an investor is likely to pick stocks that are trading at substantially lower PE multiples. On the basis of the forward 12-month P/E ratio, the industry is currently trading at 19.70 compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.21. Marriott has an edge with a lower forward 12-month P/E ratio of 21.56 compared with Hyatt’s figure of 35.16.Estimated Earnings &amp; RevenuesArguably, earnings growth is paramount for determining a stock’s potential, as surging profit levels indicate strong prospects (and stock price gains).For the current year, Marriott’s earnings per share are expected to improve to $8.65 from $6.69 in 2022. Moreover, year-over-year sales growth is expected at 15.2% for the current year. Hyatt’s current-year earnings are likely to increase to $2.52 from a loss of 81 cents, while sales are likely to rise 12% year over year.FundamentalsMarriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. The company plans to expand its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands significantly. At the end of second-quarter 2023, Marriott's development pipeline totaled 3,149 hotels, with approximately 547,000 rooms.The company emphasizes the strategic licensing agreement with MGM Resorts and creating the MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy to drive growth. The deal expands Marriott's footprint in Las Vegas (with the addition of 17 MGM Resorts properties for bookings) and enhances loyalty program benefits for both companies. The company is optimistic concerning the growth strategy and anticipates the deal to boost its room distribution by 2.4% in 2023. Overall, the company expects 2023 net rooms to grow in the range of 6.4-6.7% on a year-over-year basis.Digital innovation and social media play important roles in hotel bookings and Marriot isn’t far behind in improvising. The company re-imagined its Marriott Mobile app to meet modern travelers' needs. With nearly 186 million members globally, the company’s loyalty program, Marriott Bonvoy, supports its marketing strategies.Hyatt aims to differentiate its brands from one another by providing distinct travel experiences. The company continues to expand its presence to drive growth. During the second quarter of 2023, 24 new hotels (or 5,927 rooms) joined Hyatt's system. As of Jun 30, 2023, Hyatt had a pipeline of executed management or franchise contracts of approximately 585 hotels (or 119,000 rooms).The company continues to make significant progress with respect to its $2.0 billion asset disposition commitment. The company completed sale agreements for assets (valued at $721 million) related to its owned and leased portfolio. The properties include Hyatt Regency Greenwich (in Connecticut) and Hyatt Regency Mainz (in Germany). On Aug 3, 2022, the company entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party to acquire Hotel Irvine (for approximately $135 million). As of Aug 3, 2023, the company realized proceeds worth $721 million (from the net disposition of owned assets). The company anticipates fulfilling the $2-billion disposition commitment by 2024-end.With an increased focus on enhancing the guest experience, the initiatives and a strong customer base are likely to pave the path for solid management fee streams in the upcoming periods.Our TakeOur comparative analysis shows that Marriott has the edge over Hyatt in terms of share price appreciation and projected EPS growth rate. However, the fundamentals of both companies look solid. Taking all the factors into account, we believe Marriott is slightly better positioned than Hyatt at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And even if you do know what it is, you really don't know what it is.LLM is short for ""large language models,"" and they're about to bring fundamental change to the companies you own in your portfolio. And this change is likely to arrive faster than you or I — or the broader market — thinks.""Every business will get recreated with artificial intelligence,"" Salesforce co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff told me. ""Software engineering, which is a great example, is probably one of the areas that we're most surprised by — it's able to achieve new levels of efficiency with these AI tools. And there's going to be so many more industries as well.""My chat with Benioff came moments after his keynote speech at the annual Dreamforce conference, where he highlighted another new AI wave on the horizon: artificial general intelligence, which is a controversial science-fiction level of AI far past the current generative AI wave.I had no clue what this was before Dreamforce, but the sci-fi readers among you will. Basically, think RoboCop (for you '80s kids out there) and the Tesla bot that Elon Musk keeps on hyping. Robots that can actually think.Before the robots arrive, it was all smiles with Salesforce plush mascots at this year's AI-filled Dreamforce conference. (Yahoo Finance) (Brian Sozzi)Essentially, physical machines need an enormous amount of speed and processing power, and LLMs are the tool for the job.And as these beastly machines expand their power due to masters searching for fatter profits (RoboCop didn't need a pension), they will have profound impacts on businesses, industries, and markets.Story continuesTake for example my profession of choice, journalism.News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson told me at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference that AI will be ""epochal"" for news. He went on to warn that the industry could face a ""tsunami potentially of job losses"" due to the tech.Other execs at Dreamforce and the Goldman gathering told me they are concerned about AI bias and LLMs spitting out fake news. Both could invoke dreadful outcomes for society and business, these folks acknowledged.It's scary.Now, some of you will write me saying I am insane and have been breathing in too much AI hype for two weeks. Fair point, as I do miss the down-to-earth vibes in my home base of Long Island. But expect a big 2024 for tech companies playing meaningfully in the AI space.Think more AI-fueled guidance raises like we saw from Nvidia earlier this year as AI buying cycles get pulled forward. Wall Street analysts are clueless on how to model for this profit influx. I used to be in their seat and it's not their fault. We just haven't seen a looming demand curve such as the one we are on the cusp of witnessing with AI tools.That is no hype, it's very inevitable.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

SNA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SNABut who is Aldo Pagliari? He is a seasoned financial executive with a long history at Snap-on Inc. As the Sr VP - Finance &amp; CFO, he plays a crucial role in the company's financial strategy and operations. His insider trades, therefore, provide valuable insights into the company's financial health and future prospects.Snap-on Inc is a leading global innovator, manufacturer, and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information, and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks. The company's products and services include hand and power tools, tool storage, diagnostics software, information and management systems, shop equipment, and other solutions for vehicle dealerships and repair centers, as well as for customers in industries, including aviation and aerospace, agriculture, construction, government and military, mining, natural resources, power generation, and technical education.Over the past year, the insider has sold a total of 24,070 shares and purchased 0 shares. This trend of selling without any insider buys raises questions about the company's current valuation and future prospects.Insider Sell: Aldo Pagliari Sells 4,842 Shares of Snap-on IncThe insider transaction history for Snap-on Inc shows that there have been 0 insider buys and 24 insider sells over the past year. This trend suggests that insiders may believe the stock is currently overvalued, prompting them to sell their shares.On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Snap-on Inc were trading for $262.13 apiece, giving the stock a market cap of $13.97 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 14.62, which is lower than the industry median of 21.73 and lower than the companys historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers and its own historical averages.Story continuesInsider Sell: Aldo Pagliari Sells 4,842 Shares of Snap-on IncHowever, with a price of $262.13 and a GuruFocus Value of $247.61, Snap-on Inc has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.06. This means the stock is fairly valued based on its GF Value. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus that is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the companys past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell and the overall trend of insider sells over the past year may raise some concerns, the stock's current valuation metrics suggest that it is fairly valued. Investors should keep a close eye on future insider transactions and other indicators of the company's financial health and prospects.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for KLA The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At KLAIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Mary Wilkinson, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$320 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$484. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 21% of Mary Wilkinson's stake.KLA insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.KLA Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at KLA. Specifically, Independent Director Jeneanne Hanley ditched US$254k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes KLA Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that KLA insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$93m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About KLA Insiders?An insider sold KLA shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that KLA is growing earnings. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We'd practice some caution before buying! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

(NYSE:VZ) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 64% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Verizon Communications. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Verizon Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Verizon Communications, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Verizon Communications is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.1% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Verizon Communications Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$36m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 36% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Verizon Communications. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Verizon has readied its fleet of portable assets, including fully functional, generator-powered cell sites that can replace or enhance network coverage and capacity in a given area as well as drones and a fixed wing aircraft that can provide service and situational awareness from the sky above. Additionally, Verizon has pre-staged satellite-based portable network assets that can provide an alternate way to connect cell sites to the rest of the network in the event that a fiber cable is lost due to commercial power outages or physical damage. All of these mobile assets are complemented by portable generators and a comprehensive refueling program ready to keep the network running in case of commercial power outages.Are you ready for the storm?Verizon’s retail team stands ready to assist customers and ensure they have the right devices, accessories and connectivity they’ll need to weather the possible severe weather. And convenient options like locker, curbside and in store pickup provide quick ways to get what you need and get out.In addition to the right tech, Verizon encourages customers to take steps to ensure their family is prepared for the season as well. When a storm is forecast:Story continuesKeep devices dry: While many phones today are some degree of water resistant, take extra care to ensure phones, tablets, batteries, chargers and other equipment remain dry and accessible. Plastic zipper storage bags help shield devices, and there are weatherproof phones, phone cases and other protective accessories available.Keep devices fully charged: Make sure devices are ready when needed by keeping phone and tablet batteries fully charged in case commercial power goes out.Get some backup: When power is out for an extended period of time, portable battery packs can be a game-changer to stay connected. Don’t forget car chargers as well in case of evacuation.Create a list: Keep a list of emergency numbers in cell phones or other devices.Be prepared for loss: Take pictures of valuables and other important belongings for possible insurance claims. And make sure they’re uploaded to the cloud for backup.Review checklists: Review the hurricane preparedness checklist, power outage checklist and other resources from the American Red Cross.Download useful apps: There are plenty of free weather, news, and safety-related apps available for download to a smartphone.Business continuity is criticalThe need for a secure, reliable connection for business continuity is never more apparent than during severe weather events and other emergencies. This is especially important with today’s increasingly common hybrid-work environments, in which highly distributed and mobile workforces rely on remote collaboration and digital networking tools to conduct business across wide-ranging and local areas simultaneously.The Verizon Business portfolio of solutions and partners provides continuity of service for customers of all sizes from the largest enterprise to the small business that is the heart of the community. From SD-WAN and advanced security tools, to cloud and edge applications, fleet management and tracking through Verizon Connect, private networks and fixed-wireless Internet for primary or backup connectivity, Verizon’s network strategy gives customers the flexibility so that they’re ready for anything.In an emergency situation, agility is vital, so now is a great time to assess readiness plans ahead of storm season. Suggested steps for businesses include:Make sure contact information is updated and readily available for all employees, including at-home information for remote workers and branch information for satellite offices.Stress-test primary and backup networks and shore up any weak areas.Make copies of insurance documents, review insurance coverages and update as appropriate.Ensure employees working from home have documented all corporate equipment being used to work from home in case of damage or loss.Ensure backup plans are in place to shift work in case work-from-home employees in a storm-impacted area have to evacuate their home or their home loses commercial power.Verizon Frontline is ready to support first respondersThe Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team stands ready to deploy and is coordinating with public safety agencies in the Northeast to ensure they have the mission-critical communications support they need should they be called upon to respond to Hurricane Lee.This year alone, the team has responded to nearly 1,300 requests for communications support from more than 700 federal, state and local public safety agencies in 48 states and the District of Columbia. They have delivered more than 5,300 Verizon Frontline solutions to these agencies to help provide mission-critical voice and data service to first responders on the front lines.Composed primarily of former first responders and military veterans, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to public safety agencies and emergency responders - at no cost to the supported agencies. The team is available 24/7 to deliver Verizon Frontline technologies including portable cell sites, drones, charging stations, WiFi hotspots, and other Verizon Frontline devices and solutions that enable communications and/or boost network performance.Verizon Frontline is the advanced network and technology built for first responders – developed over nearly three decades of partnership with public safety officials and agencies on the front lines – to meet their unique and evolving needs.**Editor’s Note: To access images and b-roll of past storms, Verizon equipment, recovery efforts and more, please visit Verizon’s Media Resource Hub at https://www.verizon.com/about/news/media-resources.

We know that when we support the communities where we live, work and make our products, we live up to our promise to build a future that is both beautiful and responsible. Tapestry is committed to driving change on some of the most critical global social issues and we are supported by our employees' passion for volunteerism and our strong relationships with community partners across the globe.Each of our brands wears its commitment to social impact on its sleeve. The Coach Foundation creates opportunities and removes barriers for the next generation of young people who have the courage to Dream It Real. Kate Spade New York puts mental health at the heart of the brand's social impact work, and advocates for women's mental health as a critical component of their empowerment. Stuart Weitzman is committed to celebrating the strength of women and girls, inspiring their confidence, and empowering them - through authentic partnerships and programs - to create meaningful change in the communities we live and work in around the world.FY23 was full of meaningful accomplishments in Tapestry's volunteering commitment. In North America, 3,700 associates volunteered over 68,500 hours for 895 charities. To recognize our teams in North America for their community contributions, we established our first-ever annual volunteer recognition program, the Tapestry Gives Impact Awards. The program recognizes team and individual honorees from our North America store, corporate, and fulfillment center populations under their brand volunteer program names (Tapestry Gives, Coach Cares, Give in Spades, and Shines Brighter).Michelle V., a kate spade store leader based in Arizona and recognized as a Give in Spades Honoree said, ""culture and community is a big part of why I love working under the Tapestry umbrella for kate spade.

While it is true that about three-quarters (75%) of companies in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index pay a dividend, the average yield is only 1.54%. Few companies raise their dividend payments consistently, and dividends may get cut when times get tough.Right now, only 67 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are “dividend aristocrats.” These are stocks of companies that have raised their dividend payments for 25 consecutive years or longer. This is a select group of best-of-breed dividend growth stocks, most of which have a long track record of outperforming the broader market. For investors chasing yield or who prize the income they get from their investments, dividend aristocrats are where you want to allocate capital. Here are the three best dividend stocks to buy now.J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM)company sign outside smucker's headquarters SJM stockSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBets known for its jams, peanut butter and maple syrup, J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE:SJM) is officially a dividend aristocrat. In business since 1897, the company has now raised its dividend for 26 consecutive years, making it one of the newer dividend aristocrats in the S&amp;P 500 index.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEarlier this year, CNBC host Jim Cramer singled J.M. Smucker out for its dividend, saying: “This is just a good, solid business that deserves to be considered in the top tier of packaged-foods companies. I don’t think it gets the respect that it deserves.”J.M. Smucker is a company that is always growing and diversifying, often through acquisitions. Over the last decade, J.M. Smucker has expanded into pet food, adding Milk Bones and 9Lives to its portfolio of brands.The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.06 per share, which gives it a yield of 3%. That’s well above the average among companies trading in the S&amp;P 500. SJM stock has declined 11% this year on mixed earnings, setting up a potential buying opportunity for investors.Story continuesStanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comTool maker Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is more than a dividend aristocrat. The maker of drills and saws is a dividend king, one of the few publicly traded companies that has raised its dividend payment to stockholders for more than 50 years.In business since 1842, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has increased its dividend for 55 consecutive years. That is an extremely impressive feat. Today, SWK stock offers shareholders a quarterly dividend payment of 81 cents a share, giving it a yield of 3.50%.With annual sales of $15 billion, Stanley Black &amp; Decker is today one of the world’s largest industrial product manufacturers. While the company’s sales can be cyclical and trend up or down with the economy, its strong brand and popularity with contractors help to see it through most economic downturns.This year, SWK stock has been on an upswing, having increased by roughly 20% since January. The company and stock have gotten a lift coming out of the 2022 bear market. This is one of the best dividend stocks around.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comConsumer products company Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is another dividend king. Astonishingly, the company behind Colgate toothpaste, Speed Stick deodorant, and Irish Spring soap has paid its stockholders uninterrupted dividends since 1895. The company has also increased its dividend payout for 60 consecutive years.Today, CL stock pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents a share, which gives it a yield of 2.60%. Few stocks can match this company’s commitment to its dividend and rewarding shareholders.With roots dating back to 1806, Colgate-Palmolive is one of the oldest companies and stocks in the U.S. Like the other names on this list, Colgate-Palmolive is a diversified company with sales in more than 200 countries. However, half of the company’s annual revenue of about $18 billion still comes from its signature toothpaste and other oral care products. More recently, Colgate-Palmolive has been focusing its growth on emerging markets.CL stock has slipped 7% lower this year and looks attractively valued at current levels. Its ongoing dividend increases only strengthen the investment’s appeal.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

And even if you do know what it is, you really don't know what it is.LLM is short for ""large language models,"" and they're about to bring fundamental change to the companies you own in your portfolio. And this change is likely to arrive faster than you or I — or the broader market — thinks.""Every business will get recreated with artificial intelligence,"" Salesforce co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff told me. ""Software engineering, which is a great example, is probably one of the areas that we're most surprised by — it's able to achieve new levels of efficiency with these AI tools. And there's going to be so many more industries as well.""My chat with Benioff came moments after his keynote speech at the annual Dreamforce conference, where he highlighted another new AI wave on the horizon: artificial general intelligence, which is a controversial science-fiction level of AI far past the current generative AI wave.I had no clue what this was before Dreamforce, but the sci-fi readers among you will. Basically, think RoboCop (for you '80s kids out there) and the Tesla bot that Elon Musk keeps on hyping. Robots that can actually think.Before the robots arrive, it was all smiles with Salesforce plush mascots at this year's AI-filled Dreamforce conference. (Yahoo Finance) (Brian Sozzi)Essentially, physical machines need an enormous amount of speed and processing power, and LLMs are the tool for the job.And as these beastly machines expand their power due to masters searching for fatter profits (RoboCop didn't need a pension), they will have profound impacts on businesses, industries, and markets.Story continuesTake for example my profession of choice, journalism.News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson told me at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference that AI will be ""epochal"" for news. He went on to warn that the industry could face a ""tsunami potentially of job losses"" due to the tech.Other execs at Dreamforce and the Goldman gathering told me they are concerned about AI bias and LLMs spitting out fake news. Both could invoke dreadful outcomes for society and business, these folks acknowledged.It's scary.Now, some of you will write me saying I am insane and have been breathing in too much AI hype for two weeks. Fair point, as I do miss the down-to-earth vibes in my home base of Long Island. But expect a big 2024 for tech companies playing meaningfully in the AI space.Think more AI-fueled guidance raises like we saw from Nvidia earlier this year as AI buying cycles get pulled forward. Wall Street analysts are clueless on how to model for this profit influx. I used to be in their seat and it's not their fault. We just haven't seen a looming demand curve such as the one we are on the cusp of witnessing with AI tools.That is no hype, it's very inevitable.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Visa Inc. V and HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. HIVE.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Crypto Stocks in Focus as Interest Hike Fears WaneThe cryptocurrency market has made a solid rebound this year after an unimpressive 2022. The Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike campaign last year to combat multi-decade high inflation impacted all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Dogecoin and Litecoin.However, cryptocurrencies saw rangebound trading in August as multiple macroeconomic factors, including uncertainty over the Fed’s future course of action with its monetary tightening campaign, have made investors scramble for direction.In fact, Bitcoin price, which touched $31,500 in early July, has since retreated and was hovering around the $25,000 mark almost throughout August.However, on Sep 13, Bitcoin price once again surpassed the psychological level of $26,000, while Ethereum was trading at $1,615.4551.September is historically one of the worst months for markets but cryptocurrencies have so far shown resilience this time. The rebound comes on soaring optimism that the Fed might keep its interest rates unchanged in its September FOMC meeting.Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Fed officials are now discussing whether further rate hikes are required this year as inflation has sharply declined over the past 12 months.The Fed increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, taking its benchmark interest to the range of 5.25-5.5%. The aggressive stance has seen inflation decline to more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.Story continuesHistorically, the price of Bitcoin has exhibited a notable correlation with the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This correlation exists because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are considered to be relatively risky assets, leading investors to respond in a similar manner when evaluating their investment strategies based on prevailing market conditions. Thus, a pause in rate hikes bodes well for the cryptocurrency market in the near term.Stocks in FocusNVIDIA Corp. is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) , and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

It reported that the company partnered with Southbank Centre to launch its first cohort of 80 black art professionals to equip them with technology and skills through sessions with experts from the film, music, or photography industry.Walmart Inc.

In the company's environmental, social, and governance highlights for 2023, the company reported that it is listed on the Bloomberg 2023 gender equality index and EPA's green power partnership rankings as the number 1 retailer to use green power resources.

On August 19, the company reported some of its employee empowerment programs where it mentioned that its Career Choice program covers tuition fees for its employees enrolled in associate degrees, professional certifications, or bachelor’s degrees in addition to providing mentoring and career counseling.

(NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and some efforts that make them admirable, let's examine the most admired companies in 2023.25 Most Admired Companies in 2023Copyright: yuliufu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyIn order to create a list of the 25 most admired companies in the world, we reviewed the Fortune most admired companies for 2023. Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score. A consolidated score was calculated by taking an average of the two scores to rank the companies.25 Most Admired Companies in 202325. BlackRock, Inc.

Separately, Disney has held exploratory talks about ABC and its eight local TV stations with Nexstar Media Group Inc., people familiar with those discussions said. All of the people asked not to be named disclosing information that’s not public.In a statement Thursday, Disney said that while it’s considering strategic options for its traditional TV networks, no decisions about a sale have been made. Nexstar declined to comment.The negotiations could help establish the value of television assets that investors have increasingly seen as dead weight. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has come under pressure to sell assets amid a rapid decline of cable-TV subscribers and steep losses in its streaming business. He suggested in an interview with CNBC in July that the linear TV assets may not be central to Disney and that he was open to divesting them.It’s been a tough couple of weeks for Disney. The company engaged in a bruising battle with Charter Communications Inc. over prices for Disney channels in pay-TV bundles and on Thursday gave a sharply lower forecast for subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service. The shares were up 1.7% Friday morning in New York after reports of a potential sale.Story continuesA stand-up comic who branched into producing TV shows, Allen has spent more than $1.3 billion in recent years to acquire assets such as the Weather Channel and a string of local stations from Honolulu to Tucson. He has unsuccessfully thrown his hat in the ring other times to purchase media properties and his name has been associated recently with proposed acquisitions of TV station owner Tegna Inc. and the BET cable network.Allen’s offer for Disney’s assets is preliminary and could change, the person familiar with the discussions said. The offer is based on the assumption that the properties generated $1.25 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the past 12 months. If that number is lower or higher, Allen would change his proposed price, which is based on a multiple of eight times Ebitda.Allen would work with banks and private equity firms to finance an acquisition, the person said. He may sell the local TV stations he already owns that aren’t affiliated with ABC, so there wouldn’t be friction with other networks like CBS and NBC.His closely held Allen Media LLC already carries a lot of debt, however.As for Nexstar, former President Tom Carter, who is now an adviser to the CEO and board, told investors at a Bank of America Securities conference Wednesday that the company is interested in acquiring assets from legacy media owners like Disney that are looking to restructure. Nexstar could acquire the ABC outlets with possibly only a few divestitures to stay within limits on broadcast station ownership, he said.Carter added that there are some complications to a sale. ESPN, Disney’s sports network, shares many of its telecasts with ABC, for instance.Analysts, too, saw the news of a potential sale of the linear assets as not a straightforward solution.Rosenblatt Securities said a deal with Nexstar would be “great for the breakup value argument for Disney’s equity,” but wouldn’t be without risks for Nexstar because it would add “substantial debt at a time of rising concerns for pay TV.”Evan Young, an analyst at KeyBanc Securities, said selling the ABC network could be valued at $4 billion or more and would likely be done on a highly dilutive basis.What’s more, “a sale of ABC tells us that Disney’s view on pay-TV is that it will soon implode, which to us means applying meaningful discount rates to all linear cash flows,” Young wrote in a note to investors.--With assistance from Thomas Buckley and Ryan Vlastelica.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Your Starbucks Wait Is So LongWhy Dollar General Might Just Be the Worst Retail Job in AmericaMBAs Are Spurning McKinsey to Buy Small CompaniesAmbani’s Plan to Upend Indian Finance Lands With a ThudThe Higher-for-Longer Interest-Rate Bonanza©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"
311,fed4f036-f152-392a-8a8d-ca29596c4275,DIS,2023-09-15,Walt Disney reportedly in early talks to sell ABC to Nexstar,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/walt-disney-reportedly-early-talks-211454473.html,1694726094,VIDEO,"['DIS', 'NXST']","[The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is in the early stages of talks to sell ABC Network and its linear television stations to broadcaster Nexstar Media Group (NXST), according to an initial report from Bloomberg. In a statement, Disney says though it is ""considering a variety of strategic options"" for the business, no decisions on divesting it have been made. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal joins the Live show to discuss Disney CEO Bob Iger's outlook on the media company's TV segment, tied to the future of ESPN and its pivot toward streaming.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Walt Disney has reportedly had exploratory talks about selling off ABC network and TV stations to local broadcaster Nexstar Media Group. That's according to reports from Bloomberg. Yahoo Finance reporter Alexandra Canal is here to tell us more. Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So this is a report from Bloomberg, as you just mentioned. The stock closing up more than 1% on the heels of this news. Byron Allen another media mogul out there he has also reportedly been in talks with Disney. But I do want to emphasize that these are early stage talks. We don't even have a valuation of what the ABC network or television stations would be worth.Disney did not immediately respond to my request for comment, but it does demonstrate how serious Bob Iger has been when he talks about taking this company to the next level. He's mentioned quite a few times how linear assets, they're no longer core to the company's business. But I do think spinning them off is going to be more complicated than we think.Linear is profitable. It's a high margin business. ESPN, which really does seem to be the crown jewel of Disney at the moment, it does simulcast a lot of its programs on ABC. So how would that look with a potential sale?For a company like Nexstar, they aren't immune to M&amp;A. They actually bought a majority stake of the CW from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount last year. They have actively expressed that they would be interested in buying off some of those assets from Disney. But it does make you think of what a future Disney could look like. Clearly Bob Iger is very focused on direct to consumer, on streaming, on over-the-top.Story continuesBut speaking of streaming, we just got a headline crossed from Bloomberg that said they plan to cut their target for Disney Plus streaming subscribers. We'll wait to hear a little bit more on that reporting. But to me that doesn't sound so good, especially when you're a company that's giving up so much on the linear side to try and focus on the streaming business.So just another headwind for Disney as it's been battling quite a few of those over the past few months.SEANA SMITH: That could be problematic here from Disney if, in fact, this report here from Bloomberg is right. Allie, you're also watching another story here, and that's AMC selling 40 million shares, receiving over $325 million in new equity capital. What does this mean for AMC as a company? Does all it can to really improve the fundamentals potentially here of its business?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. And I was just looking up the stock price there because interestingly, it did close down 1% when it was up as much as 9% earlier today on the heels of that report-- not report, I should say, rather the fact that they have raised a significant amount of capital-- over 325 million through that stock conversion plan.The stock has been very volatile as investors have become pretty worried that would lead to more dilution over time. But we consistently heard from CEO Adam Aron, who said that this was very imperative for the company to survive, to shore up its balance sheet, to have those cash reserves.And we're entering a period of time in the fall where there's not a lot of blockbusters. We don't have that big ""Barbie"" movie, that ""Oppenheimer"" movie. We do have the ""Taylor Swift Eras Tour"" movie, which should be a tailwind for AMC. But in the background, you have the Hollywood writers strike, which means we likely will see more blockbuster delays moving forward.So something like this is certainly important for a company like AMC. But, again, shares closing down more than 1% giving up a lot of those gains from earlier in the session.SEANA SMITH: All right, Allie Canal, thanks.]"

In February, returning CEO Bob Iger said Disney would no longer provide subscriber forecasts, matching a decision at Netflix Inc.Disney+ has been losing customers to price increases, as well as collapsing demand in India after the company failed to win cricket streaming rights. That’s led management to conclude it will fall short of those earlier numbers, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal targets.Wall Street’s focus in the past year has shifted from sign-up numbers at online video platforms to profitability, and Disney has narrowed its losses in its streaming division by hundreds of millions of dollars in recent quarters.Price increases have helped. Iger has raised the price of Disney+ since its launch in 2019 as part of an effort to reach profitability in the streaming business as early as next year.Shares of Disney rose 1.2% to $84.48 at the close in New York. Earlier Thursday, Bloomberg News reported that Nexstar Media Group Inc. and broadcast entrepreneur Byron Allen have separately expressed interest in buying Disney’s ABC network and local TV stations.The company is still seeking to increase customers to Disney+. A deal announced this week with Charter Communications Inc., the No. 2 US cable provider, will package Disney+ with the Spectrum TV service, adding millions of new customers. Disney will receive a reduced, wholesale price for those subscribers.Story continuesIn 2020, it set a target for as many as 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024 for Disney+ and the Hotstar product in India, before lowering the target last year.The company finished its fiscal third quarter with 146.1 million Disney+ subscribers.Read more: Disney Said to Hold Initial Talks on Sale of ABC to Nexstar(Updates with share price in fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMBAs Are Spurning McKinsey to Buy Small CompaniesTikTok Shop Is a Real E-Commerce ThreatThe Real-Life Inspiration Behind The Bonfire of the VanitiesPhonemakers Not Named Apple Are in Love With Foldable Phones©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

317,9ed9b49b-2374-3a96-a45c-f4394cf0157c,CL,2023-09-15,"Oil prices extend rally on China stimulus cheer, tight supply outlook",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-extend-rally-china-204551110.html,1694724351,STORY,"['SCO', 'CL', 'UCO', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com -- Oil prices edged lower Friday, with traders taking profit from the hefty gains seen this week, largely on optimism that the vital Chinese economy is showing signs of improvement.By 09:05 ET (13.05 GMT), the U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $89.98 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $93.49.Chinese optimism boosts marketThe crude market received a boost earlier Friday following the release of stronger-than-expected industrial production and retail sales data from China, boosting optimism over an economic recovery in the largest crude importer in the world.This added to the positive sentiment generated by the decision of the People’s Bank of China on Thursday to cut the reserve requirement ratio for local banks by 25 basis points - its second such cut this year. The move is expected to release more liquidity into the Chinese economy and potentially shore up economic growth.China's oil refinery throughput in August also surged to a record high, data on Friday showed, as solid summer travel demand and a rush to take advantage of strong export margins led processors to keep run rates elevated.The refining figures come as markets are attempting to gauge if output reductions by key producers Saudi Arabia and Russia will keep supplies tight this year.Oil set for over 3% weekly gainBoth crude benchmarks were set to gain more than 3% each this week, their third straight week of gains.Crude prices have been on a tear since early June, after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they will cut supply by a combined 1.3 million barrels per day. The two recently extended their supply cuts until the end of the year, providing another leg up to crude prices.The prospect of tighter markets, in the wake of the supply cuts, has been the biggest boost to oil prices this year, helping them jump more than 30% since June.ECB hints at final rate hikeThis positivity has helped the market to largely look past U.S. inventory data released this week, which showed that fuel demand in the country may be slowing as the travel-heavy summer season winds down, as well as slowing economic growth in Europe, a major consuming region.Story continuesThe European Central Bank raised its key deposit rate to a record high of 4% on Thursday, but also signalled that its 10th straight hike was likely to be its last as it downgraded its growth forecasts.Additionally, the higher oil prices will likely lead to increased political pressure, particularly in the U.S., where the Biden administration has already reduced the country’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 40-year lows in an attempt to cushion consumers from high prices.“It appears as though the U.S. Department of Energy has already been in touch with domestic oil producers and refiners with regard to inventories and the supply outlook,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “We are likely to hear only more noise around this matter, particularly after a strong CPI print.”Related ArticlesOil prices edge lower; set for positive week on Chinese optimismCrude oil edges lower; set for positive week on Chinese optimismOil set for another weekly gain on tight supply and China optimism]"

The move is intended to free up lending to the private sector by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve.It is still early to say how well the latest stimulus measure might work in shoring up the world’s No. 2 economy from its worst challenge in decades. Industrial production and retail sales data, due on Friday, will provide more evidence on the current state of affairs in the Chinese economy. Even so, oil bulls were quick to translate the impact any liquidity enhancement and resultant activity could have on fuel demand among the Chinese.The Chinese stimulus, along with the mantra on how super tight oil supply across the world was — despite Saudi Arabia’s promise that every contracted barrel will be delivered to its customers, notwithstanding its supposed daily cut of one million barrels per day — drove crude to 10-month highs for a fourth session in a row.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled at $90.16 per barrel, up $1.64, or 1.9%. The U.S. crude benchmark rose to $90.50 earlier in the day, its highest since November.""As long as WTI holds above the 100-week Simple Moving Average, statically aligned with $86, bullish continuation doesn't seem much obstacle,"" said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com. ""But expect resistance at $93, and a harder stop at $96.""London-traded Brent settled at $93.70 per barrel, up $1.82, or 2%. The global crude benchmark rose to $93.89 earlier.Crude prices have been on a tear since June, gaining just over 30% over the past three months, as bulls chased the Saudi obsession to get the market back to the $100-per barrel advantage it lost in July last year. The Saudis, along with the Russians, have pledged to remove a combined supply of 1.3 million barrels from the market daily through the end of the year.Story continues“Another day, another spin on how tight the oil market will remain,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.China stimulus only one half of storyOne other reason for Thursday’s oil rally was the stronger U.S. U.S. producer prices and retail sales for August. The increase in retail sales, incidentally, was a result of Americans spending more on gasoline last month, leading to the notion that they will continue doing so regardless how high prices at the pump go.“Positive news about the U.S, economy helped oil a little today as the consumer is still spending,” observed Moya. He, however, added: “The consumer won’t be spending as much once we start talking about a national average gas prices above $4 a gallon.”The average pump price of gasoline across America was $3.858 per gallon on Thursday, up by a little more than 5 cents from a week ago.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil: China stimulus sends U.S. crude to $90 first time in 10 monthsGold has brush again with $1,900; Lives to survive another day at that supportUS crude prices above $90/bbl ignite inflation worries]"

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.Stocks climbed on September 14 following robust economic reports, reigniting speculation that the Federal Reserve can orchestrate a gentle economic slowdown, even if it decides to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period. In contrast, the euro declined as expectations grew that the European Central Bank would maintain its current stance following a recent interest rate hike. The S&amp;P 500 approached the 4,500 mark. During the early part of the trading session on September 14, futures on equities briefly trimmed their gains, prompted by stronger-than-expected retail sales and producer price data, influenced in part by increased fuel expenses. Two-year Treasury yields remained relatively stable after surging immediately after the release of this economic data. The U.S. dollar recorded a marginal increase in value. Oil prices remained close to a 10-month peak as prominent forecasts increasingly point towards tight oil markets for the remainder of the year. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil continued to trade above $89 per barrel after a notable surge on Wednesday, reaching its highest intraday level since mid-November. This uptick in oil prices coincides with a series of reports from leading analysts. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), there is an anticipation of a ""significant supply shortfall"" in the upcoming months. Similarly, OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) estimates this deficit could be the largest in over a decade. Furthermore, the U.S. government also foresees a scenario where global consumption outpaces production, underscoring the growing concerns of a tightening oil market.The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised its main interest rate for the 10th consecutive time, prioritizing the battle against inflation over a weakening economy. This move has pushed the central bank's main deposit facility from -0.5% in June 2022 to a record 4%. One of the key drivers for this hike was upward revisions in the ECB's inflation projections, forecasting an average of 5.6% for this year (up from 5.4%) and 3.2% for next year (up from 3%). However, the ECB slightly lowered its medium-term forecast from 2.2% to 2.1%. The central bank also hinted that further rate hikes might be on hold for now, stating that the current interest rates would contribute significantly to returning inflation to the target if maintained. Following this announcement, the euro fell sharply, reaching a three-month low against the U.S. dollar. On the other hand, European stocks rallied, with the benchmark Stoxx 600 index up by 1.1%.Story continuesThe ECB also increased interest rates on its main refinancing operations and marginal lending facility by 25 basis points each, bringing them to 4.5% and 4.75%, respectively. The ECB also adjusted its economic growth projections for the euro area, with lower growth expectations for the coming years. According to CNBC, while there was uncertainty about the outcome of this ECB meeting, market sentiment leaned toward a rate hike, partly due to inflation concerns and oil market reports suggesting tighter supply and higher prices. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized the central bank's data-dependent approach but stressed the importance of the current rate levels in the fight against inflation. The German economy, the largest in Europe, has been experiencing a decline, with falling business sentiment and weakening services and manufacturing sectors. Despite this, the ECB proceeded with the rate hike to combat rising inflation. Market focus is now on the language used in the ECB's statement, particularly the inflation forecast for 2025, revised lower, and the indication that rates will be maintained at current levels for a ""sufficiently long duration,"" suggesting a flat rate path for some time.Photo by AlphaTradeZoneMeanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP), UMB Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:UMBF) and ImmunoGen, Inc. (NASDAQ:IMGN) are receiving a massive vote of approval from Wall Street analysts.

MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.20 (-0.31%)On September 13, Jefferies Financial Group made a significant announcement regarding MetLife, Inc.

This upgrade by Jefferies Financial Group indicates increased confidence in MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) future potential. Investors and financial market enthusiasts need to take note of this change, as it may signal an attractive investment opportunity within the insurance and financial services sector.08. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.08 (-0.13%)On September 13, JPMorgan analyst Lyndon Fagan played a pivotal role in the recent upgrade of Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), a prominent mining corporation. This upgrade, orchestrated by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., has generated significant interest in the financial world, with investors and analysts closely tracking Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stock performance. As of the latest available data, on September 13, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stock was valued at $63.11, reflecting a marginal decline of 0.1%. While various market factors may influence this slight fluctuation in stock price, the key development lies in the shift of analysts' sentiment. They have transitioned from a ""Neutral"" rating to an ""Overweight"" recommendation for Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stock. This upgrade suggests that Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) may present an attractive opportunity for those interested in the mining and resources sector.HL International Equity Strategy made the following comment about Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“In terms of geographical performance, the eurozone emerged as the top-performing region, and our stocks did better still, fueled by the strong performance of Infineon, L’Oréal, and Schneider Electric. EMs, which lagged the index, were boosted by the improving outlook for semiconductor companies TSMC and Samsung. Mexico’s FEMSA also contributed strongly to relative returns. Europe ex EMU was the weakest region primarily due to the underperformance of SE Banken and UK miner Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO). The latter was affected by concerns over softer iron ore pricing in the current year, another reflection of manufacturing weakness in steelmaking giant China.”07. Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: -0.02 (-0.02%)On September 13, Jefferies Financial Group upgraded Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), a major player in the insurance and financial services industry. Jefferies analyst Suneet Kamath upgraded Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) from Underperform to Hold with a price target of $93.00 from $70.00. As of the latest data, Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) stock was trading at $96.58, showing no significant change at 0.02%. This upgrade signifies a change in perspective, indicating that Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) may be in a more stable position than previously thought. Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) may be a company to watch for those interested in the insurance and financial services sector after this upgrade.Much like American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP), UMB Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:UMBF) and ImmunoGen, Inc. (NASDAQ:IMGN), Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) is receiving a significant show of confidence from financial analysts on Wall Street.06. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.19 (+0.57%)On September 13, UBS Group revised its outlook on General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), one of the leading players in the automotive industry. This revision entails upgrading General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) status from a ""Neutral"" to a ""Buy"" recommendation, accompanied by an adjusted price target of $44, up from the previous target of $41. This change comes as a new analyst has assumed responsibility for covering General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and their analysis suggests that the market has already factored in a significant degree of pessimism. UBS Group's upgrade signifies a more positive outlook on General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stock. This change in recommendation implies that, according to UBS Group's analysis, GM's current valuation and market sentiment have considered many of the negative factors and uncertainties surrounding the automotive industry. The increased price target of $44 suggests that UBS Group believes there is untapped potential for General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stock to perform better than anticipated.Diamond Hill made the following comment about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Most recently, we initiated a position in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), one of the largest automakers in the United States. Over the past several years, GM has taken steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world. With the recent rise in interest rates there was a meaningful selloff in the auto industry, which presented us an attractive entry point to a name we know well.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts. Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks to Buy for Good Returns15 Good Stocks To Invest In13 Best Stocks To Invest In According to AIDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy What Is Devon Energy's Net Debt?As you can see below, Devon Energy had US$6.41b of debt, at June 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$372.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$6.04b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Devon Energy's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Devon Energy had liabilities of US$2.67b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$9.54b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$372.0m and US$1.52b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$10.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Devon Energy has a huge market capitalization of US$32.5b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Devon Energy's net debt is only 0.68 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 20.6 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On the other hand, Devon Energy saw its EBIT drop by 5.5% in the last twelve months. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Devon Energy can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Devon Energy recorded free cash flow of 47% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.Our ViewOn our analysis Devon Energy's interest cover should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For example, its EBIT growth rate makes us a little nervous about its debt. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Devon Energy is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Devon Energy (2 are a bit unpleasant)  you should be aware of.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Buffett’s net worth is up $15.6 billion since the start of 2023.Discover: Investing Advice That Warren Buffett and Elon Musk Agree OnLearn: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Buffett, CEO and chair of investment firm Berkshire-Hathaway, is edging closer to Oracle chair Larry Ellison and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on the billionaires list. But his fortune wasn’t obtained overnight; it’s been decades in the making.Buffett is said to have bought his first investment at age 11 and was worth $60,000 (adjusted for inflation) by age 16, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Since then, he’s earned the reputation as someone who believes in giving back as much as he has earned. In 2010, he formed The Giving Pledge with Bill and Melinda Gates, which suggests that billionaires donate at least 50% of their net worth to charity during their lifetimes.Warren Buffett’s Early YearsBorn on Aug. 30, 1930, Warren Buffett hails from Omaha, Nebraska. His first job was as a paperboy, and he invested his earnings in real estate. In high school, he launched a pinball business and accumulated a net worth of $6,000. After moving with his family to Washington D.C., he graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947. His prophetic yearbook picture had the caption: “a future stockbroker.”Buffett graduated from the University of Nebraska with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, then enrolled in Columbia Business School where he earned his Master of Science in Economics.Warren Buffett and Berkshire HathawayWhen Warren Buffett first got involved in the now-legendary investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, it was a textile manufacturing company. By 1979, the company was trading at $775, ending the year worth $1,310 per share. His accomplishments earned him the nickname “Oracle of Omaha,” as his personal net worth skyrocketed to $620 million by 1983.Story continuesWarren Buffett’s Financial Plan to Tackle America’s Debt: ‘I Can End the Deficit in 5 Minutes’Warren Buffett’s WealthToday, Warren Buffett’s wealth as one of the top ten billionaires in the world comes largely from his ownership in investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. The firm owns over 60 companies including the likes of Geico Insurance, Duracell batteries and Dairy Queen restaurants, according to Forbes.Buffett recently invested $814 million in home building firms, with the lion’s share going to D.R. Horton’s, according to the Financial Times. Berkshire Hathaway is now one of the company’s largest stockholders with 1.8% of the shares. He also invested in Lennar and NVR.In the past, Buffett steered clear of real estate as an investment vehicle. But investing in property and investing in the housing market, as a whole, by putting money into homebuilding companies, are two different things.His recent investment undoubtedly helped Buffett’s bottom line as he climbs up the Billionaire’s list. The S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry stock index is up 36.4% this year, compared to 16.5% for the S&amp;P. D.R. Horton, Lennar, and NVR have all risen more than 35% this year, and it would seem Buffett expects they have further to rise.Buffett continues to live in the modest 5-bedroom home he purchased in Omaha in 1956 for $31,600. In a video on Yahoo Finance, he said the only house in his personal portfolio is the third-best investment he has ever made, behind his wedding rings for himself and his wife.Today, his Omaha house is valued at roughly $1.4 million, according to Realtor.com. However, he said that he could have made more money renting the house and using the money to purchase stocks.More From GOBankingRatesJaspreet Singh Shares 5 Ways To Grow $10k to $100k in Three YearsThe Nuclear Savings Rule: 10 Frugal Living Tips from the 1950s Era3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Is ‘The Oracle of Omaha’ Warren Buffett Worth?]"

The self-storage giant announced the successful completion of its $2.2 billion acquisition of Simply Self Storage from Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”). This strategic move signals Public Storage's commitment to its growth strategy and determination to capitalize on the expanding self-storage market.Public Storage anticipates that the acquisition from BREIT, which is externally managed by a subsidiary of Blackstone BX, will be accretive to funds from operations (FFO) per share, with accretion gaining momentum as the properties stabilize. The acquisition includes a substantial portfolio of 127 wholly owned properties spanning 18 states and offering 9 million net rentable square feet.What's noteworthy is the geographical diversification of these properties across markets with consistently high population growth, double the national average since 2018. Around 65% of these properties are strategically located in high-growth Sunbelt markets, aligning perfectly with Public Storage's expansion goals.Public Storage is focused on leveraging its industry-leading brand and operational platform to boost customer recognition and enhance performance. Its integration of an additional 25 properties into its PS Advantage third-party management platform augurs well for growth.By combining Simply's experienced team with Public Storage's industry-leading brand and operating platform, PSA aims to deepen its presence in fast-growing markets and create additional avenues for growth and value creation. Public Storage financed the acquisition through $2.2 billion of senior unsecured notes, effectively utilizing its growth-oriented balance sheet.This acquisition aligns seamlessly with Public Storage's opportunistic growth strategy. Since the beginning of 2019, PSA has expanded its portfolio by an impressive 33%, equivalent to 54 million net rentable square feet, through $10.7 billion of acquisitions, development and redevelopment, including properties under contract.However, Public Storage is not the only self-storage REIT pursuing expansions. Its peer, Extra Space Storage EXR, also concluded the buyout of Life Storage, Inc. in an all-stock transaction in July 2023. This acquisition by Extra Space Storage has significantly enhanced its scale in the self-storage industry, making the combined entity the largest self-storage operator in the United States (based on the number of self-storage locations).For Public Storage, the acquisition of Simply Self Storage is a strategic step toward expanding its already substantial footprint in the self-storage market. The company's focus on high-growth markets and ability to efficiently integrate new properties into its portfolio position it for continued success. Recent acquisition and development properties in its non-same-store pool now account for nearly 30% of Public Storage's portfolio, promising substantial growth for both the company and its stakeholders as these properties lease up over the coming years.However, a development boom in certain markets could intensify competition and curb pricing power. Also, with tenants reverting to more normal move-out behavior, growth in occupancy and rent is expected to be limited. High interest rates add to its woes.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 5.5% in the past three months, wider than its industry’s fall of 2.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNote: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

Let's delve into the valuation analysis to understand the company's true worth better.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with HAS. Click here to check it out. HAS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HASHasbro is a leading global play and entertainment company with a rich portfolio of well-known brands such as Transformers, Nerf, and Magic: The Gathering. The firm's offerings range from toys and games to television programming, motion pictures, and a robust licensing program. Hasbro's strategic acquisitions, including Entertainment One in 2019 and a tie-up with Dungeons &amp; Dragons Beyond in 2022, have strengthened its multichannel presence and diversified its offerings.As of September 14, 2023, Hasbro's stock price stands at $68.13, while its GF Value, an estimation of the fair value, is $82.12. This discrepancy suggests that the stock might be modestly undervalued, paving the way for a deeper examination of the company's intrinsic value.Hasbro (HAS): A Hidden Gem or an Overpriced Stock? An In-depth Analysis of Its ValuationUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary valuation model that estimates a stock's intrinsic value. It considers historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade.According to our GF Value, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) appears to be modestly undervalued. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock is likely overvalued, implying poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, suggesting higher future returns. Given Hasbro's current price of $68.13 per share, it appears to be modestly undervalued.Story continuesDue to its relative undervaluation, the long-term return of Hasbro's stock is likely to outperform its business growth.Hasbro (HAS): A Hidden Gem or an Overpriced Stock? An In-depth Analysis of Its ValuationLink: Discover companies that may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength AnalysisInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can result in a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, investors must thoroughly review a company's financial strength before purchasing its shares. Key indicators of financial strength include the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Hasbro's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.05 ranks worse than 87.88% of 825 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry, indicating poor financial strength.Hasbro (HAS): A Hidden Gem or an Overpriced Stock? An In-depth Analysis of Its ValuationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. Hasbro has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years, with a revenue of $5.60 billion and a Loss Per Share of $1.85 in the past twelve months. However, its operating margin of 2.72% ranks worse than 61.34% of 820 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry.Hasbro's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 65.45% of 767 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 5.5%, which ranks better than 51.97% of 608 companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) provides insights into its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If ROIC exceeds WACC, the company creates value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Hasbro's ROIC was 2.21, while its WACC was 5.71.Hasbro (HAS): A Hidden Gem or an Overpriced Stock? An In-depth Analysis of Its ValuationConclusionIn conclusion, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) appears to be modestly undervalued.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.3%, 16.4% and 32%, respectively.Despite facing volatility in the past four weeks, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. However, several S&amp;P 500 components lagged the index to a big extent. A handful of those laggers are U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank. We have selected five such stocks that have vast upside left.Momentum Likely to ContinueThe inflation rate has been dwindling steadily since June 2022. The consumer price index of August came in at a three-month high. However, that was primarily due to higher energy prices. Moreover, the fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduced the possibility of a near-term recession.On Sep 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift from its rigorous interest rate hike policy, the Fed would restrain from a rate hike at this month’s FOMC meeting. Moreover, the journal reported that Fed officials are considering all aspects about whether more rate hikes are at all needed this year.At present, the Fed fund rate is in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The CME FedWatch tool is showing a 97% probability that the Fed will maintain a status quo in the September FOMC meeting, while a mere 3% chance is there that the rate will be hiked by 25 basis points.Athough the inflation rate is currently well above the Fed’s 2% target level, majority of Fed officials are of the view that further tightening of monetary policies may be detrimental to the economy. Monetary policy variables always affect the economy during a lag period. Therefore, Fed officials believe that the central bank should wait for the full effect of the current level of interest rate to be visible.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with strong potential for the rest of 2023.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's deep dive into Prologis Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.About Prologis IncWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with PLD. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Prologis was formed by the June 2011 merger of AMB Property and Prologis Trust.

The company also has a strategic capital business segment that has around $60 billion of third-party AUM. The company is organized into four global divisions (Americas, Europe, Asia, and other Americas) and operates as a real estate investment trust.Prologis Inc (PLD): A Deep Dive into its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityPrologis Inc's Dividend HistoryPrologis Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1997. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Prologis Inc has increased its dividend each year since 2009. The stock is thus listed as a dividend achiever, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 14 years.Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.Prologis Inc (PLD): A Deep Dive into its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityPrologis Inc's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, Prologis Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.70% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.82%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.Story continuesOver the past three years, Prologis Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 14.20%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 11.60% per year. And over the past decade, Prologis Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 10.40%.Based on Prologis Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Prologis Inc stock as of today is approximately 4.67%.Prologis Inc (PLD): A Deep Dive into its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityAssessing Dividend Sustainability: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Prologis Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.90.Prologis Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Prologis Inc's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Examining Growth Metrics for Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Prologis Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Prologis Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Prologis Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 13.10% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 88.01% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Prologis Inc's earnings increased by approximately 20.00% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 70.99% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 7.10%, which outperforms than approximately 58.62% of global competitors.ConclusionIn conclusion, Prologis Inc presents a compelling case for investors seeking steady dividends. With a consistent dividend payment history, promising yield and growth rates, and robust profitability and growth metrics, the company appears well-positioned to sustain its dividends in the long run. However, investors should keep an eye on the relatively high payout ratio, which could pose a risk to dividend sustainability in case of unexpected downturns.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Prologis in FocusBased in San Francisco, Prologis (PLD) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 7.55%. The industrial real estate developer is paying out a dividend of $0.87 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.87% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.84% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.67%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.48 is up 10.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Prologis has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.43%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Prologis's payout ratio is 58%, which means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PLD expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.59 per share, with earnings expected to increase 8.33% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PLD is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

347,b0dd2698-c961-3cd5-b9a5-5e013f23fe46,AXP,2023-09-15,12 Best Small-Cap Value ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-small-cap-value-115432541.html,1694778872,STORY,"['AXP', 'AAPL', 'IVZ', '^RUT']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best small cap value ETFs. If you want to skip our introduction to small cap investing, then check out 5 Best Small-Cap Value ETFs. Small cap investing is a specialized strategy that exposes an individual to opportunities to potentially profit if the timing of the bets is right. One of the biggest reasons why most people are attracted to small caps is that their lower share prices allow for significant profits in case of good market performance. In addition to the small market capitalization, another advantage that small cap stocks offer is that, for American investors in particular, these firms are generally disconnected from global economies.This insulation, which stems mostly from the fact that small cap stocks are of companies with limited economic scale, also means that if economic news isn't too great in other countries, the shares might drop. For example, Apple is one of the world's biggest smartphone companies and the undisputed king when it comes to the high end market. Additionally, its smartphones are the only ones that have often seen widespread media coverage for providing strong protection for their security features. Naturally, this instills of trust in the brand and makes the iPhone quite popular. However, in early September, reports started surfacing that China is banning government officials from using the smartphone. This had an impact on Apple's shares as well, as the stock dropped from a closing price of $189.70 on September 5th to close at $177.58 two days later. The scale of Apple's operations and its size (latest market capitalization is $2.8 trillion) also means that news similar to Chinese iPhone restrictions leads to re-balancing in the share price of other firms. In short, the world's most valuable company in terms of market capitalization, lost $156 billion in market value due to potential changes in a country thousands of miles away.Story continuesIn the small cap world, such news would also affect companies but only those that have a significant business relationship with Apple. At the same time, this would also mean that while a $156 billion market cap loss to Apple represents a digestible 5.5% drop in market capitalization, depending on the nature of our hypothetical small cap company, the loss of market value could be larger. Players such as Apple often account for a large portion of small companies' revenue, and the severe effect of this unbalanced relationship can often transform firms from going to gone concerns.The risk of losing large sums in small cap stocks also makes it important that the broader economic environment is considered when investing in them. After all, their insulation to global economic conditions also makes them even more sensitive to on-goings in America. As a result, common market wisdom says that small cap stocks are ones that make larger losses as the market prepares for a recession. This is because investors generally seek the safety offered by large cap companies, especially since their shares are more liquid and can be easily bought and sold on the market. Once any economic downturn, or its news, is over, then the small cap stocks are also typically faster to rise, as money piles in to bet that they will be able to capture demand that is sapped in an economic downturn.Within the small cap stock classification, one can divide the companies across several parameters. Two of these are value stocks and growth stocks. A value stock can be defined with several metrics. Two of these are the price to earnings and price to sales ratios, which measure the premium that the market is paying over a company's ability to bring in money either through overall sales or after accounting for all costs of production, financing expenses, and tax obligations. The P/E and P/S ratios of established companies are generally lower depending on the industry, and these stocks are attractive particularly for portfolio diversification. This is because a value stock stands to lose less in a market downturn as investors have refrained from ascribing a premium to its shares similar to what they have done with growth stocks. At the same time, prudent stock market gurus also determine whether there is the potential for a value stock to grow in the future. After all, all the big companies of today were value stocks yesterday, and the smartest investors bought their shares back then to become rich right now.Before we dig into small cap value exchange traded funds (ETFs), one great example of a value stock that delivered is American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). AXP's place in stock market history is tied to Warren Buffett, who started buying the shares at a time when they were quite cheap. Mr. Buffett bought AXP when the shares had dropped significantly, and he recalled this period years later by commenting:There was one other little wrinkle which was terribly interesting. American Express was not a corporation. It then was the only major publicly traded security that was a joint stock association. As such, the ownership of the company was assessable. If it turned out that the liabilities were greater than the assets, [then] the ownership was assessable. So every trust department in the United States panicked. I remember the Continental Bank held over 5% of the company and all of a sudden not only do they see that the trust accounts were going to have stock worth zero, but it could get assessed. The stock just poured out, of course, and the market got slightly inefficient for a short period of time. . . .The whole American Express Company, synonymous with financial integrity and money substitutes around the world. When they closed the banks, when Roosevelt closed the banks, he exempted American Express Traveler's Checks, so they substituted as U.S. currency. It was not a business that should have been selling for $150 million, but everyone was terrified.So, with these details in mind, we decided to take a look at some top small cap value ETFs out of which the top picks are Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Revenue ETF (NYSE:RWJ), Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM), and First Trust Small Cap Value AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FYT).12 Best Small-Cap Value ETFsPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from PexelsOur Methodology To compile our list of best small cap ETFs we first made a list of the 20 largest small cap value ETFs and then ranked them by their trailing five year daily total returns.

Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc.

We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023.

This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

And American Express card members are going to find it harder to get into Delta Sky Clubs in airports.Starting in 2024, earning status will depend entirely on how much you spend. The company will use a standard called Medallion Qualifying Dollars as the rubric for status. Here’s what you’ll need to shell out for Medallion membership:Silver Medallion - $6,000 MQDsGold Medallion - $12,000 MQDsPlatinum Medallion - $18,000 MQDsDiamond Medallion - $35,000 MQDsThe good news is, not all of that has to be spent on flights. Car rentals, hotel stays, and certain vacation packages can be credited to the total. And people who hold Delta loyalty credit cards will receive one MQD for every $10 (if you have a Delta SkyMiles Reserve and Reserve Business American Express card) or $20 (SkyMiles Platinum and SkyMiles Platinum Business cards) you spend on everyday purchases.Delta American Express members will also no longer receive status boost benefits or a waiver to MQD requirements.The changes will not impact 2024 status, but come 2025, some people used to frequent flyer perks will see several less than they’re used to.Sky Club changesBeyond the major changes to its frequent flyer program, Delta is also restricting access to its Sky Club lounges, where flyers on layovers can grab a bite to eat or a drink for free.Beginning Jan. 1, 2024, the carrier said, holders of Delta SkyMiles Platinum and Platinum Business American Express Card Members will no longer be eligible for club access. And flyers who opt for a Basic Economy ticket won’t be allowed in at all, even if they have a qualifying credit card.And starting Feb. 1, 2025, holders of the American Express Platinum Card or the Delta Reserve American Express Card will see their number of allowed visits capped. Platinum Card holders will be allowed six visits per year, while the Delta Reserve Card holders will get 10 annual visits.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, Cemex is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Martin Marietta has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CX likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MLM has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.CX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.54, while MLM has a forward P/E of 24.99. We also note that CX has a PEG ratio of 0.55. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MLM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.31.Another notable valuation metric for CX is its P/B ratio of 0.80. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MLM has a P/B of 3.62.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CX's Value grade of A and MLM's Value grade of C.Story continuesCX stands above MLM thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For a quick overview of the 5 biggest food exporters in Europe, read our article 5 biggest food exporters in Europe.European countries are known for their delicious food and export billions of dollars annually. From France's cheese and wine to Italy's pasta and pizza, there's something for everyone to enjoy. Europe's food export to the world has driven the economy of the continent. European nations, renowned for their culinary traditions and stringent quality standards, have forged a global reputation for producing premium food products. Since the start of 2022, the European Union has reached a total of €369 billion in agri-food trade, 23% more than they did during the same time in 2021 (from January to November). These exports encompass diverse goods, from fine wines and cheeses to chocolates, olive oils, and processed foods.Moreover, the European Union (EU) is a major global food and beverage market player. It tops the charts as the world's largest food and drink product exporter and the second-largest importer. Europe's food industry takes the lead in exporting processed agricultural products (PAPs), and it manages to maintain a favorable trade balance. However, over the last decade, Europe's share of the global export market has been on the decline, with Brazil and China emerging as strong competitors in the field.Netherlands has emerged as a global exemplar by utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as vertical farming, innovative seed technology, and robotics. Through these advancements, the country has positioned itself as a leading model in global agricultural production and export, demonstrating the potential for sustainable and efficient farming practices. Netherlands has nearly 24,000 acres of crops flourishing within its extensive greenhouse facilities, an area nearly twice the size of Manhattan. These greenhouses in the Netherlands are super-efficient. They can produce as much on one acre as it would take 10 acres of regular farming. Dutch farms use just half a gallon of water to grow a pound of tomatoes, while the worldwide average is more than 28 gallons.Story continuesFurthermore, Ukraine is a major global supplier of staple grains, such as wheat, corn, and barley. Russia's invasion has severely disrupted the country's agricultural sector, threatening food security worldwide. In 2021, Ukraine's agricultural exports totaled over $27 billion, accounting for 41% of the country's total exports. The World Food Program (WFP), a United Nations humanitarian organization, receives 40% of its wheat from Ukraine.The European Union (EU) and its member states are the largest providers of development aid globally. In June 2022, EU countries supported a $8.57 billion commitment for 2020-2024 to help address the increasing and urgent food security needs. This commitment is part of the EU's broader efforts to boost global food security. EU countries also significantly contribute to global food security by exporting much of their agricultural production to developing nations. Over half of the EU's wheat exports go to Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Nigeria) and Asia (Pakistan). The EU's food security commitment is a welcome step in addressing hunger and malnutrition worldwide.A Look into the European Union Food IndustryMondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a global snacks company that produces and markets food and beverages, including cookies, crackers, chocolate, candy, gum, and cheese, with net revenues of approximately $31.5 billion in 2022. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) generates two-thirds of its revenue from developed markets and one-third from emerging markets, with the latter growing at over 12%. The company has 133 manufacturing plants on five continents and employs approximately 79,000 worldwide.Nestlé (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) is a Swiss multinational food and drink company in Europe. The company's products are sold under various brands, including Nescafé, Nespresso, KitKat, Maggi, and Stouffer's. In 2021, total reported sales rose by 3.3% to CHF 87.1 billion, with a 1.3% reduction due to foreign exchange effects. Nestlé (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) expects organic sales growth of 6% to 8% in 2023, with 17.0% to 17.5% as underlying trading operating profit margin.Diageo Plc (LON:DGE) is a British multinational alcoholic beverage company headquartered in London. The company's products are sold under various brands, including Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Guinness, Baileys, and Captain Morgan. Diageo Plc (LON:DGE) is constantly developing new products and services to meet the needs of its customers and is committed to reducing its environmental impact and improving the lives of its stakeholders. In 2022, Diageo Plc's (LON:DGE) revenue was £20.56 billion, and its annual EPS was 21.85% more than as of 2021, i.e. £5.93. In 2022, Diageo sold 5.4 billion units of alcohol, and its retail sales value in the global alcohol market was $1.17 trillion.Europe's Biggest Food ExportersNejron Photo/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo rank the 16 biggest food exporters in Europe, we used two metrics, i.e., Value of Food Exports and Growth in Value of Food Exports (2021-2022).

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Prestige Consumer Healthcare is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PBH's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PBH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.63, while BSX has a forward P/E of 26.70. We also note that PBH has a PEG ratio of 1.70.

BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.09.Another notable valuation metric for PBH is its P/B ratio of 1.97. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Specifically, the award celebrates the work of Paul Negulescu, Ph.D., Fredrick Van Goor, Ph.D., and Sabine Hadida, Ph.D., who have worked together to lead cystic fibrosis (CF) discovery for over 20 years.""The research teams led by Paul, Fred and Sabine discovered the first and only medicines that address the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. This remarkable effort required discovery of three novel mechanisms of action, resulting in the first disease modifying therapies that act by restoring function to a misfolded protein,"" said David Altshuler, M.D., Ph.D. Executive Vice President, Global Research, and Chief Scientific Officer. ""This prize recognizes the dedication and creativity of thousands of people at Vertex spanning research, development, regulatory, manufacturing and patient access, as well as our partners in the CF community, who have worked tirelessly to bring these medicines to people with CF around the world.""The gene responsible for cystic fibrosis was discovered in 1989, but until the work of Vertex scientists, treatment of CF addressed only its symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the disease. Today, Vertex’s four approved oral medicines treat CF by improving the function of the defective CFTR protein. The first of these medicines, KALYDECO® (ivacaftor), was approved in 2012, and today is approved for people with CF ages 1 month and older carrying responsive CFTR mutations. The most recently developed medicine, TRIKAFTA®, is a triple combination therapy (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) first approved in 2019 that today can treat ~90% of people with CF who have responsive mutations.Story continuesVertex is currently developing a next-in-class investigational CF triple combination therapy, now in Phase 3 trials, that has the potential for enhanced clinical benefit. The company is also in early clinical trials in collaboration with Moderna to develop an mRNA therapeutic designed to treat the approximately 5,000 people with CF who do not produce any CFTR protein. If this mRNA therapy is successful, it will be possible for all people with CF to have medicines to treat the underlying cause of their disease.The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences was founded in 2013 by Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, Yuri and Julia Milner, and Anne Wojcicki. Breakthrough Prizes are also awarded annually in the fields of Fundamental Physics and Mathematics.

CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and this can prevent the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface and functioning properly. TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is an oral medicine designed to increase the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.About KALYDECO® (ivacaftor)In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein at the cell surface does not function properly. Known as a CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor is an oral medicine designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways. KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) was the first medicine to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in people with specific mutations in the CFTR gene.U.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or another mutation that is responsive to treatment with TRIKAFTA.

That is because the Sep 15, 2023 $125.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Norfolk Southern shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Norfolk Southern is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Transportation - Rail industry that ranks in the Bottom 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.45 per share to $3.10 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Norfolk Southern right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chairman &amp; CEO, James Robert Quincey, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$9.6m worth of shares at a price of US$64.33 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$58.46. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Coca-Cola insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$1.7b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Coca-Cola insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Coca-Cola and we suggest you have a look.But note: Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) , and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). These companies are known to perform well by serving their stakeholders to position themselves well in their respective industries. Let’s take a look at all of them.Apple Inc.

It reported that the company partnered with Southbank Centre to launch its first cohort of 80 black art professionals to equip them with technology and skills through sessions with experts from the film, music, or photography industry.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a popular US chain of retail hypermarkets and discount stores. The company has secured several international recognitions as a result of its efforts to be sustainable. In the company's environmental, social, and governance highlights for 2023, the company reported that it is listed on the Bloomberg 2023 gender equality index and EPA's green power partnership rankings as the number 1 retailer to use green power resources.

Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retiring to Germany, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Germany.On Retiring ComfortablyOn average, Americans need an estimated $1.8 million to retire comfortably, according to a new survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). Marci Stewart, director of communication consulting and participant education for The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)'s Workplace Financial Services, notes that the impact of inflation and market volatility has raised this estimate from $1.7 million a year ago. A “retirement gap” is also partly to blame, depicting the gap between what potential retirees have saved and what they will need when they retire.A Vanguard study further notes that, on average, Americans aged 65 or older only have $233,000 saved in their retirement accounts. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) study further highlights that fewer workers are now confident whether they will have enough savings to last them through their retirement years. Only 37% now believe they can save enough for retirement, a 10% drop from the previous year.While there are many possible ways that potential retirees can use to boost their savings for retirement, the Motley Fool recommends investing in proven winners that have dominant market share positions and stellar balance sheets, such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Investing as little as $5,000 can work wonders for retirement.Unsurprisingly, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) accounts for 3% of all drinks consumed globally. Q2, 2023 saw The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO)'s organic sales rise by 11% while the operating profit margin rose by 32% as well. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated an operating profit of $24 billion in the company's Q4, 2023 quarter, up 21% year on year. Investing in proven stocks can help retirees save up the magic number they need for their retirement years.Story continuesRetiring to GermanyPotential retirees are exploring new options, considering where to spend their retirement years. Many flock to the Caribbean, while others go where they can to further stretch their retirement savings, such as Mexico, Panama, and cities in Central America. Another country on many retirees' wish list is Germany. Nestled in the heart of Europe, the country is the epitome of historical charm and contemporary living.There are many pros and cons of retiring to Germany. The healthcare system in the country is certainly one of the finest, and all residents have access to world-class healthcare facilities. Moreover, the quality of life is exceptionally high. The country is clean and green, the infrastructure is well-developed, and people respect the environment. The cities within offer diverse cultural experiences and picturesque beauty that captivates people from around the world.However, language is a prominent barrier for those who cannot speak German. Learning the language is an important factor when retiring here. Otherwise, accessing services, integrating into the community, and performing simple tasks such as grocery shopping may be challenging. As such, the best places to live in Germany for English speakers include Munich, Dusseldorf, and Bremen.For those wondering how to retire in Germany, or specifically, how to retire in Germany as an American, the country doesn’t have a specific retirement visa. An American can live in Germany without a visa for a period of 90 days. Staying longer in Germany will require you to apply for a temporary residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis) during the initial 90 days. The German visa requirements for residence include a passport, proof of German address, proof of health insurance and evidence that you can financially support yourself without working.15 Best Places to Retire in GermanyPhoto by Jacek Dylag on UnsplashMethodologyTo compile the list of the 15 best places to retire in Germany, we began by exploring expat forums such as Quora, Expat.com and Expat Forum to assess the best places recommended by expat retirees living in Germany.We also looked at other sources (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) recommending the best German places.

369,750f51d2-0221-3e41-8122-af4de4fb5e33,KO,2023-09-15,Brokers Suggest Investing in Coke (KO): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-coke-ko-133005031.html,1694698205,STORY,['KO'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 6.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Coke, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is KO a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.63.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Weyerhaeuser is also one of the largest manufacturers of wood products in America.Insider Trading AnalysisOver the past year, Denise Merle has sold a total of 9,281 shares and has not purchased any shares. This recent sale of 7,500 shares is a significant portion of the total shares sold by the insider over the past year.The insider transaction history for Weyerhaeuser Co shows no insider buys over the past year, but there have been three insider sells during the same period. This could indicate a trend among insiders that they believe the company's stock is currently overvalued.Senior Vice President Denise Merle Sells 7,500 Shares of Weyerhaeuser Co (WY)The relationship between insider trading and stock price is complex. While insider selling can sometimes be a bearish signal, it's important to consider the context. Insiders may sell shares for personal reasons unrelated to the company's performance or outlook. However, the absence of insider buying over the past year could be a cause for concern for investors.Story continuesValuationOn the day of Denise Merle's recent sale, Weyerhaeuser Co shares were trading at $32.29, giving the company a market cap of $23.9 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 34.06, significantly higher than the industry median of 17.29 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio.With a price of $32.29 and a GuruFocus Value of $30.81, Weyerhaeuser Co has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.05, indicating that the stock is fairly valued based on its GF Value.Senior Vice President Denise Merle Sells 7,500 Shares of Weyerhaeuser Co (WY)The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus. It is calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.In conclusion, while the recent insider sell by Denise Merle is noteworthy, it does not necessarily indicate a negative outlook for Weyerhaeuser Co. Investors should consider the broader context, including the company's valuation and other factors, when making investment decisions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Approximately 800,000 are living with kidney failure and over 560,000 use some type of dialysis treatment.The countrys largest kidney dialysis treatment provider is DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA). As of June 30, the company provided dialysis services to 248,000 patients at 3,056 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,703 centers were located in the U.S. and 353 centers were located in 11 international countries.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DVA. Click here to check it out. DVA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DVAThe company provides kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. It operates kidney dialysis centers and provides related lab services in outpatient dialysis centers. It also offers outpatient, hospital inpatient and home-based hemodialysis services. In addition, DaVita offers integrated care and disease management services to patients in risk-based and other integrated care arrangements, clinical research programs, physician services and other comprehensive kidney care services.Incorporated in 1994, the company is headquartered in Denver. The current market capitalization if $9.2 billion.Kidney diseaseThere are five stages of chronic kidney disease, or CKD. These stages are generally based on how well the kidneys work to filter waste and extra fluid out of the blood, with higher stages of CKD corresponding to progressing levels of kidney disease.Stage 1 CKD is the closest to healthy kidney function. A Stage 5 classification indicates that a patient has severe kidney damage. A patient diagnosed with Stage 5 CKD has kidneys that have lost nearly all functionality or have failed.If the patient's kidneys fail, they are then diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, also known as end-stage kidney disease. Because loss of kidney function is normally irreversible, these patients require continued dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant to sustain life. Dialysis is the removal of toxins, fluids and salt from the blood of patients by artificial means.Story continuesPatients suffering from ESKD generally require regular life-sustaining dialysis therapy for the rest of their lives or until they receive a kidney transplant. Because kidney failure is typically caused by type I and type II diabetes, hypertension, polycystic kidney disease, long-term autoimmune attack on the kidneys and prolonged urinary tract obstruction, slowing the progression generally involves working with nephrologists or dieticians to help control blood pressure, monitor blood glucose and maintain healthy diet and exercise routines, among other things.Financial reviewThe company reported second-quarter results on Aug. 3, which showed strong traction on strategic initiatives. Total U.S. dialysis treatments for the quarter were 7,231,242, or an average of 92,708 treatments per day, which was an increase of 0.3% compared to the first quarter.The quarter was negatively impacted by a seasonal decrease in hospital inpatient revenues. The year-to-date change was primarily driven by a net increase in the Medicare rate due to a base rate increase in 2023, which was partially offset by the phased increase of sequestration of 1% in April 2022 and full 2% beginning July 1, 2022. The increase was also impacted by the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans and overall favorable mix improvements as well as increases in hospital inpatient dialysis revenues.Revenue increased 2.5% to $3 billion compared to the prior-year period and adjusted operating income was $432 million. Adjusted operating income improved on a sequential basis from $352 million in the first quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow was $450 million and free cash flow was $260 million for the second quarter.On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $340 billion and long-term investments were $639 million. Total debt was $8.7 billion.In a statement, CEO Javier Rodriguez said, ""Over the first half of the year, DaVita has been focused on innovation in our clinical systems and driving operational improvements throughout our organization. Our second quarter performance reflects strong traction across those initiatives, putting us on a path to deliver strong clinical outcomes and financial results for the year.""ValuationConsensus earnings per share estimates for 2023 are $7.24 and $8.04 for 2024. That puts the stock trading at 13.5 times 2023 estimated earnings. The current enterprise value/Ebitda ratio is 9.5, which is below the sector average of 13.5.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator creates a value of $110 when using $7.24 as the starting point and an 8% 10-year growth rate.There are three Wall Street analysts with recent reports with an average price target of $123, including a high target of $142 and a low target of $112.The company does not currently pay a dividend, but is an active repurchaser of its own shares. Share buybacks have totaled $3.8 billion over the past three fiscal years.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased DaVita stock recently include Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio). Investors who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio) and Larry Robbins (Trades, Portfolio).SummaryDaVita provides a critical health care need as kidney disease affects a large portion of the U.S. population. Two-thirds of company revenues are provided by Medicare or other government providers, which creates some pricing risks.The stock is trading in the middle of its 52-week range, but there appears to be upside ahead and represents a potentially solid long-term investment opportunity for patient investors.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

388,80630ccf-1c62-3deb-9551-2cfc43dde07a,GE,2023-09-15,Here's Why General Electric (NYSE:GE) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-general-electric-nyse-140019605.html,1694700019,STORY,['GE'],"[Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric What Is General Electric's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that General Electric had debt of US$21.8b at the end of June 2023, a reduction from US$32.5b over a year. However, it also had US$21.6b in cash, and so its net debt is US$231.0m.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is General Electric's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that General Electric had liabilities of US$48.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$82.5b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$21.6b and US$16.5b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$92.6b.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$123.0b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry. Carrying virtually no net debt, General Electric has a very light debt load indeed.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).General Electric's debt of just 0.025 times EBITDA is really very modest. And EBIT easily covered the interest expense 8.9 times over, lending force to that view. Better yet, General Electric grew its EBIT by 137% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Electric's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, General Electric actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Our ViewGeneral Electric's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its level of total liabilities. Looking at the bigger picture, we think General Electric's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for General Electric (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

Adults with disabilities or aged 65 years or above qualify for this program. STAR+PLUS entails members to avail a suite of daily living activities, home modifications, respite care and personal support services within the comfort of their home.The new contract imparts UnitedHealthcare the power to offer high quality care across eight service areas in Texas, which are Bexar, Central Texas, Dallas, Harris, Hidalgo, Northeast Texas, Tarrant and Travis. Working closely with the providers and community-based organizations of Texas will enable the UNH unit to gain an in-depth understanding of the needs of the state’s residents and serve them better. This, in turn, is likely to result in better health outcomes for the state’s medically vulnerable aged and disabled community.A longstanding experience of more than two decades in serving Texas’ Medicaid members may have fetched the contract win for UnitedHealthcare this time. Such contract wins boost the customer base and fetch health insurers with higher premiums, which remain the most significant contributors to their top line. The medical membership of UnitedHealthcare grew 3.1% year over year as of Jun 30, 2023. Further, its Medicaid membership witnessed year-over-year increase of 4.6% in the same time frame.The strength of its Medicaid business has fetched the UnitedHealth Group unit numerous contract wins from time to time. This August, it won a Medicaid managed care contract from New Mexico Human Services Department to more effectively serve New Mexican residents from Jul 1, 2024.These contract wins are also a means to fortify the presence of UnitedHealth Group across several U.S. states. Needless to say, the recent move is likely to strengthen UNH’s footprint across Texas. It boasts an extensive network of 671 hospitals and, more than 126,000 physicians and other care providers located throughout the state and subsequently, takes care of 4.7 million plus residents enrolled in employer-sponsored, individual, Medicare and Medicaid benefit plans.Story continuesShares of UnitedHealth Group have gained 3.1% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 4.3% growth.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.3%, 16.4% and 32%, respectively.Despite facing volatility in the past four weeks, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. However, several S&amp;P 500 components lagged the index to a big extent. A handful of those laggers are U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank. We have selected five such stocks that have vast upside left.Momentum Likely to ContinueThe inflation rate has been dwindling steadily since June 2022. The consumer price index of August came in at a three-month high. However, that was primarily due to higher energy prices. Moreover, the fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduced the possibility of a near-term recession.On Sep 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift from its rigorous interest rate hike policy, the Fed would restrain from a rate hike at this month’s FOMC meeting. Moreover, the journal reported that Fed officials are considering all aspects about whether more rate hikes are at all needed this year.At present, the Fed fund rate is in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The CME FedWatch tool is showing a 97% probability that the Fed will maintain a status quo in the September FOMC meeting, while a mere 3% chance is there that the rate will be hiked by 25 basis points.Athough the inflation rate is currently well above the Fed’s 2% target level, majority of Fed officials are of the view that further tightening of monetary policies may be detrimental to the economy. Monetary policy variables always affect the economy during a lag period. Therefore, Fed officials believe that the central bank should wait for the full effect of the current level of interest rate to be visible.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with strong potential for the rest of 2023.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Admired Companies in 2023.What Makes A Company Admired?Companies around the world are known for serving their customers, employees, shareholders, local community, and other stakeholders. Let's have a look at certain factors which contribute to the sense of admiration for a company.Company CultureThe sense of admiration for any company primarily comes from the company culture. This culture is based upon a set of core values on which the company operates. On June 28, Great Place to Work, a publisher of the world’s best companies’ rankings, reported that a good company culture is where the leadership is credible since employees are 11 times more likely to work at a company for long if it offers trustworthy leadership. Although compensation matters for employees, other aspects like good leadership and a sense of pride in work highly impact employee retention and loyalty.A Customer-Centric ApproachA company strategy focusing on achieving customer satisfaction, convenience, and retention goes a long way. The success of some most admired companies around the world comes down to the effort they put in to meet and even anticipate evolving customer needs. An example of a company that aligns its business goals and decisions with its customers is Delta Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). This US-based airline has launched several features to improve the overall customer experience even at a height of 30,000 feet above the ground. On July 12, the company reported that it has partnered with T-Mobile successfully to equip 600 domestic planes with free Wi-Fi to make the customers feel at home. The company also has plans to extend this internet connectivity feature to all of its international flights by 2024. Furthermore,  the airline company has introduced a new platform called Delta Sync exclusives for its frequent flyers, the SkyMiles members, through which they can access entertaining streams, look up their trip itinerary, and plan their activities while they are on board.Story continuesAdmirable Companies Leading the WaySome of the most reputable companies in the world include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) , and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology company that specializes in consumer electronics. Its broad range of products including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, have penetrated across the world.

It reported that the company partnered with Southbank Centre to launch its first cohort of 80 black art professionals to equip them with technology and skills through sessions with experts from the film, music, or photography industry.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a popular US chain of retail hypermarkets and discount stores. The company has secured several international recognitions as a result of its efforts to be sustainable. In the company's environmental, social, and governance highlights for 2023, the company reported that it is listed on the Bloomberg 2023 gender equality index and EPA's green power partnership rankings as the number 1 retailer to use green power resources. The company has been working on its priority of achieving zero waste in its operations. The employee statistics for the company are also promising as 88% of the US associates who got a promotion in 2023 started from entry level. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) offers an hourly compensation of $21.75 to its US associates which includes many women and people of color as well.Another company that is acclaimed at a global level is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company continues to earn its name in the market by immensely supporting its employees. On August 19, the company reported some of its employee empowerment programs where it mentioned that its Career Choice program covers tuition fees for its employees enrolled in associate degrees, professional certifications, or bachelor’s degrees in addition to providing mentoring and career counseling.

Fortune ranks the extent of admiration for a company through 9 different metrics namely ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of management, corporate social responsibility, innovativeness, product quality, wise use of corporate assets, financial soundness, long-term investment value, and effectiveness in doing business globally. We shortlisted the top 40 companies.Moving on, we decided to carry out our research focusing on the brand performance and employees.For brand performance, we considered SyncForce’s ranking the brands list for 2023. We used the scores under the brand performance category as our first metric. This brand performance score is a global score based on how much a brand is mentioned in positive brand rankings. More positive brand rankings indicate a higher rank on this list. A better brand performance leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention.For the employee dimension, we looked at Glassdoor’s survey of best companies to work in 2023. We considered the total employee score as our second metric. This score included all fundamental employee factors such as compensation and benefits, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, culture and values, career opportunities, and senior management.Finally, we created our own rankings by including only those Fortune most admired companies for 2023 that rank higher on both the employee score and the brand performance score.

406,9c1a6347-0a26-3a8a-9bbc-530f5b1cc9fb,MAC,2023-09-15,Here's Why You Should Retain Macerich (MAC) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-macerich-mac-143800822.html,1694702280,STORY,['MAC'],"[The Macerich Company MAC owns a portfolio of premium shopping centers in the vibrant markets of the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor. With robust retail demand and muted new supply continuing to drive the recovery in the retail real estate industry, Macerich remains well-poised to ride the growth curve. However, growing e-commerce adoption and high interest rates make us apprehensive.What’s Aiding it?Demand for retail real estate has remained robust over the recent quarters. Amid this, Macerich’s shopping centers, located in densely populated areas having an affluent customer base with a significant disposable income, are witnessing healthy demand from retailers as they continue to rent out more physical store spaces. Moreover, solid tenant demand has helped the company backfill its spaces, which is a positive.Notably, from the beginning of 2023 through Aug 21, it signed leases for 2.4 million square feet of space, a record. This represented a 34% increase in square footage signed from the prior-year period.Hence, with an encouraging leasing pipeline, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) is likely to experience significant rental income growth in the upcoming years. We expect year-over-year growth of 2.9% in total revenues in 2023. For 2024 and 2025, the metric is estimated to increase 3% and 4.2%, respectively.Macerich efforts to enhance its assets quality as well as customer relationships by increasing the adoption of the omni-channel model, a popular choice among retailers post the pandemic, is likely to pay off well. Also, focusing on the re-use and mixed-use of its properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants will help bring brands to new markets, drive more footfall and boost sales.Further, the company’s aggressive capital-recycling program and redeployment of the proceeds to fund acquisitions, and development and redevelopment activities highlight its prudent capital-management practices. Per the second-quarter 2023 Investor Presentation, for 2023-2024, management expects to spend an average of $155 million per year on development and redevelopment projects.Macerich’s healthy balance sheet position with ample financial flexibility is likely to continue supporting its growth endeavors. As of Aug 8, 2023, the company had around $565 million of liquidity, including $405 million of available capacity on its $525 million revolving line of credit.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.5% in the past three months against the industry’s fall of 1.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Hurting it?Given the conveniences of online shopping, growing e-commerce adoption may weigh on Macerich’s prospects. Online retailing will likely remain a popular choice among customers, thus adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.A slowdown in the economy amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment could limit consumers’ willingness to spend under such circumstances, stalling the company’s growth tempo to some extent. For 2023, we project a year-over-year decline of 8.2% in funds from operations (FFO) per share, excluding financing expenses in connection with Chandler Freehold.High interest rates are a key concern for Macerich. In the second quarter of 2023, a rise in interest expense of $15 million or 7 cents per share negatively impacted FFO per share growth. Further, under the current economic scenario, the company may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Phillips Edison &amp; Company PECO, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Phillips Edison &amp; Company’s current-year FFO per share has been raised marginally in the past two months to $2.32.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Essential Properties Realty Trust’s 2023 FFO per share has moved slightly upward in the past month to $1.66.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tanger Factory Outlet Centers’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has been revised marginally northward in the past month to $1.88.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Horton (NYSE:DHI) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-d-r-horton-nyse-120034605.html,1694779234,STORY,['DHI'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton What Is D.R. Horton's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that D.R. Horton had US$6.12b in debt in June 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$3.13b, its net debt is less, at about US$3.00b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is D.R. Horton's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, D.R. Horton had liabilities of US$5.67b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$4.57b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.13b in cash and US$315.9m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$6.80b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Since publicly traded D.R. Horton shares are worth a very impressive total of US$38.5b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).D.R. Horton's net debt is only 0.46 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 1k times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. But the bad news is that D.R. Horton has seen its EBIT plunge 13% in the last twelve months. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if D.R. Horton can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, D.R. Horton reported free cash flow worth 20% of its EBIT, which is really quite low. That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.Our ViewBoth D.R. Horton's ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT and its net debt to EBITDA gave us comfort that it can handle its debt. In contrast, our confidence was undermined by its apparent struggle to grow its EBIT. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about D.R. Horton's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. Of course, we wouldn't say no to the extra confidence that we'd gain if we knew that D.R.

The share price depreciation resulted in the AAL stock ending the trading session at $13.31. The downside was due to the unfavorable guidance provided by AAL for the third quarter of 2023, owing to high fuel and labor expenses.For third-quarter 2023, American Airlines now anticipates average fuel cost per gallon in the band of $2.90-$3.00 (prior view: $2.55-$2.65). With fuel expenses being a significant input cost for the aviation space, the uptick in oil prices does not bode well for airlines.Apart from rising fuel expenses, AAL is also burdened with the retroactive pay expense of almost $230 million. This retroactive pay expense is a result of the ratification of the new labor deal (for wage increase) with the pilots represented by the Allied Pilots Association, which is to be recognized in the third quarter of 2023. Notably, this retroactive pay expense is expected to weigh on third-quarter adjusted operating margin by almost 1.7 points and adjusted earnings per diluted share by $0.23.Adjusted operating margin is now anticipated in the range of 4%-5% (prior view: 8-10%). AAL now anticipates third-quarter 2023 earnings in the range of $0.20-$0.30 per share (prior view: $0.85-$0.95).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 75 cents per share.Third-quarter consolidated operating costs per available seat mile (CASM: excluding fuel and net special items) are now anticipated to be at the better end of AAL’s prior guidance range unveiled on Aug 22, 2023. The metric is now expected to be up 4-5% (prior view: 4-6%).Due to its continued solid operating performance, AAL now anticipates its third-quarter capacity or available seat miles to grow 6%-7% (prior view: 5-7%). Total revenues for the third quarter are anticipated to be almost flat compared with prior expectations.AAL now expects total revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenue) to decline between 5.5% and 6.5% from third-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier estimate was a 4.5-6.5% decline). AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company's updated third quarter profit guidance dropped to $1.85 to $2.05 from $2.20 to $2.50. Delta follows Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and American Airlines (AAL) who cut their forecasts this week citing higher fuel costs.Yahoo Finance Live discusses how costs are impacting Delta and the airline industry.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Delta, the shares are on the move this morning. They become the latest airline in cutting profit estimates amid the higher costs. The company is expecting third quarter earnings to be $1.85 to $2.05 compared to previous guidance of $2.20 to $2.50. The shares are higher by just about 4/10 of 1%.We have had a raft of airlines come out in recent days and update their guidance to the downside. Delta, by the way, fell 2.8% yesterday, so that is perhaps why it is not falling as much today because yesterday American Airlines and Spirit came out and cut their forecasts. There's a Morgan Stanley transportation conference, so a lot of these companies are coming out with these announcements related to that and ahead of that. So Delta becomes the latest to do so.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, they did reaffirm their full year guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share, so no change there. However, the September quarter earnings of $1.85 to $2.05 per share and an operating margin of about 13% is what they also provided within this commentary here. Total revenue per available seat mile, that's actually expected to be down 2% to 3% led by strength largely in the trans-Atlantic with steady domestic trends they're saying, including one point of pressure from cargo and MRO.But particularly here what we have kind of had in annexation for some of the other airlines that have reported some type of hit to their earnings as a result of higher expenses that are fuel related is actually a little bit different from what Delta is saying here because they're saying that domestic trends are steady for right now. Some of the other low cost airlines had said that they saw some moderation there this week.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, Spirit in particular.BRAD SMITH: Mm-hmm.]"

With oil price moving north, some other airlines echoed similar sentiments and increased their respective fuel price per gallon projections for the September quarter. That story was covered in detail in the previous week’s writeup.Latin American carriers, Gol Linhas GOL and Azul AZUL reported a double-digit increase in consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) for the month of August on the back of upbeat air travel demand.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. American Airlines’ management stated that “fuel prices have increased considerably since the company’s initial third-quarter guidance issued on Jul 20, 2023.” The company now expects fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of taxes) in the $2.90-$3.00 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range).  AAL now expects total revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenue) to decline 5.5-6.5% from third-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier estimate was a 4.5-6.5% decline). Fuel gallon consumption is now estimated to be $1,100 million for the third quarter (the earlier view was $1,090 million).High fuel costs apart, the increase in labor costs, due to the deal with pilots, is also a reason behind the guidance cut. The deal has provisions for retroactive pay, as a result of which $230 million will be reflected as additional expenses in the September-quarter results. This retroactive expense is expected to impact third-quarter adjusted operating margin by approximately 1.7 points. Operating margin is now expected in the 4-5% band (earlier expectation was 8-10%).Due to high labor costs, third-quarter non-fuel unit costs are now projected to increase in the 4-5% band (earlier outlook had called for a 4-6% increase). Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are now expected to increase 6-7% from third-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier estimate was a 5-7% increase).Story continuesHigh labor and fuel costs prompted management to slash its third-quarter earnings per share (excluding net special items) view to the range of 20-30 cents from 85-95 cents expected earlier. Labor costs associated with the deal with pilots are likely to hurt earnings to the tune of 23 cents. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Spirit Airlines’ management now expects third-quarter fuel cost per gallon to be $3.06 compared with the earlier projection of $2.80.  Fuel gallon consumption is still estimated to be $147 million for the third quarter. For third-quarter 2023, management now expects total revenues in the $1,245-$1,255 million range (earlier range: $1,300-$1,320 million). Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be between -14.5% and -15.5% (earlier view projected a decline of 5.5-7.5% from third-quarter 2022 actuals). The effective tax rate is projected to be 22.6%. Available seat miles are now anticipated to increase 13.4% from third-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier projection had called for a 13.7% increase).3. For the month of August, Azul’s consolidated traffic increased 13.5% year over year. To match the increased demand situation, AZUL is expanding its capacity. In the same period, capacity grew 13.1% year over year. Since traffic growth was more than capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) increased 0.3 percentage points to 81.6% last month.4. At GOL, the August readings for consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of traffic) and available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 11.6% and 7.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor for August 2023 improved to 84.4% from 81.5% in August 2022. The number of departures at GOL increased 17.8% year over year.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red in the past week.

Its assets, rich in copper, gold, and molybdenum reserves, span from the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia to mining operations in North America and South America. The company's large-scale Morenci minerals district in Arizona and the Cerro Verde operation in Peru are particularly noteworthy. Freeport-McMoRan's primary revenue stems from copper sales.At a stock price of $41.04, Freeport-McMoRan has a market cap of $58.80 billion. The company's GF Value, an estimation of fair value, stands at $40.05, marking the stock as fairly valued. This valuation sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's intrinsic value, combining financial assessment with essential company details.Unveiling Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor informed by past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade.Freeport-McMoRan's stock is estimated to be fairly valued based on the GF Value calculation. If the stock price significantly surpasses the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it falls significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Given that Freeport-McMoRan is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to align with the rate of its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company's stock, it's crucial to evaluate its financial strength. Investing in companies with poor financial strength poses a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide valuable insights into a company's financial strength. Freeport-McMoRan has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.7, which is lower than 75.41% of companies in the Metals &amp; Mining industry, indicating fair financial strength.Unveiling Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is generally less risky. Freeport-McMoRan has been profitable six out of the past ten years. With a revenue of $21.90 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.45 over the past twelve months, and an operating margin of 25.14%, Freeport-McMoRan ranks better than 86.49% of companies in the Metals &amp; Mining industry in terms of profitability.Freeport-McMoRan's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 61.96% of companies in the Metals &amp; Mining industry, and its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate of 58.4% ranks better than 93.09% of companies in the industry. This indicates strong growth prospects for the company.Evaluating ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also help evaluate its profitability. The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. In the past 12 months, Freeport-McMoRan's ROIC is 9.17 while its WACC came in at 13.59.Unveiling Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: FirstEnergy Corp. FE, PNM Resources, Inc. PNM, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Atmos Energy Corp. ATO and J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. JJSF.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Safe Stocks to Buy as Inflation Comes in Hotter than ExpectedOptimism over the Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate hikes in September has been soaring over the past few weeks but fresh inflation data released on Sep 13 might play spoilsport.According to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, the August inflation reading came in hotter than expected, raising fears that the Fed might continue with its monetary tightening campaign. Higher rates don’t bode well for the broader market. Given this scenario, investing in defensive sectors such as FirstEnergy Corp., PNM Resources, Inc., PepsiCo, Inc., Atmos Energy Corp. and J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. should be safe.Inflation Soars in AugustThe Labor Department reported on Wednesday that CPI increased 0.6% in August on a month-over-month basis, higher than the 0.2% rise in July. Year over year, CPI rose 3.7% in August, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.6%.The last time CPI increased more than 0.6% was in February 2022.Core CPI, which strips out the volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.3%, higher than the economists’ expectations of a rise of 0.2%. Year over year, core CPI, increased 4.3%, in line with expectations and 40 basis points down from July’s reading.However, core CPI still remains more than double the Fed’s target of 2%, which gives enough reasons to worry.The constant rise in oil prices played a major role in the sudden rise in inflation in August. Energy prices jumped 5.6% in August, while gasoline prices soared 10.6%. Food prices increased 0.2%.Story continuesRate Hike Fears ReigniteOil prices worldwide have been on the rise in recent times, primarily due to the decision of major oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend supply cuts until December 2023.Additionally, the improvement in China's manufacturing activity has contributed to the upward trend in oil prices. This is significant because China's economic growth is expected to lead to increased oil imports and a subsequent rise in demand for oil-related products.The surge in oil prices triggered inflation in August as higher oil prices led to elevated transportation costs, which subsequently affected the prices of essential goods and services. Higher oil prices saw airfares jump 4.9% in August.The Fed has already indicated that it is open to more interest rate hikes as inflation, despite sharply declining over the past year, remains elevated. And now the August inflation reading gives the central bank ample reasons to continue with its monetary tightening campaign.The Fed has already increased rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%. Needless to say, more interest rate hikes don’t bode well for the economy and the broader market. Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks would be a wise decision.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities. Also, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1). Hence, the recommended approach is to invest in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.FirstEnergy Corp. is a diversified energy company. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, FE engages in the transmission, distribution and generation of electricity.FirstEnergy Corp has an expected earnings growth rate of 5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last 60 days. FE currently has a Zacks Rank #2. FirstEnergy Corp has a beta of 0.45 and a current dividend yield of 4.35%.PNM Resources, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is engaged in distributing energy and energy-related businesses in the United States.

423,ef332d36-3c57-33e4-945b-e36c99753bb1,PEP,2023-09-15,5 Safe Stocks to Buy as Inflation Comes in Hotter Than Expected,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-safe-stocks-buy-inflation-131600897.html,1694697360,STORY,"['FE', 'ATO', 'PNM', 'PEP', 'JJSF']","[Optimism over the Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate hikes in September has been soaring over the past few weeks but fresh inflation data released on Sep 13 might play spoilsport.According to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, the August inflation reading came in hotter than expected, raising fears that the Fed might continue with its monetary tightening campaign. Higher rates don’t bode well for the broader market. Given this scenario, investing in defensive sectors such as FirstEnergy Corp. FE, PNM Resources, Inc. PNM, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO and J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. JJSF should be safe.Inflation Soars in AugustThe Labor Department reported on Wednesday that CPI increased 0.6% in August on a month-over-month basis, higher than the 0.2% rise in July. Year over year, CPI rose 3.7% in August, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.6%.The last time CPI increased more than 0.6% was in February 2022.Core CPI, which strips out the volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.3%, higher than the economists’ expectations of a rise of 0.2%. Year over year, core CPI, increased 4.3%, in line with expectations and 40 basis points down from July’s reading.However, core CPI still remains more than double the Fed’s target of 2%, which gives enough reasons to worry.The constant rise in oil prices played a major role in the sudden rise in inflation in August. Energy prices jumped 5.6% in August, while gasoline prices soared 10.6%. Food prices increased 0.2%.Rate Hike Fears ReigniteOil prices worldwide have been on the rise in recent times, primarily due to the decision of major oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend supply cuts until December 2023.Additionally, the improvement in China's manufacturing activity has contributed to the upward trend in oil prices. This is significant because China's economic growth is expected to lead to increased oil imports and a subsequent rise in demand for oil-related products.Story continuesThe surge in oil prices triggered inflation in August as higher oil prices led to elevated transportation costs, which subsequently affected the prices of essential goods and services. Higher oil prices saw airfares jump 4.9% in August.The Fed has already indicated that it is open to more interest rate hikes as inflation, despite sharply declining over the past year, remains elevated. And now the August inflation reading gives the central bank ample reasons to continue with its monetary tightening campaign.The Fed has already increased rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%. Needless to say, more interest rate hikes don’t bode well for the economy and the broader market. Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks would be a wise decision.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities. Also, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1). Hence, the recommended approach is to invest in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

424,53cb92e6-7b70-3550-8b19-bdbc8344d7ad,PEP,2023-09-15,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-pep-attracting-investor-130010387.html,1694696410,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this food and beverage company have returned -0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.2% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has lost 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $2.18 per share, indicating a change of +10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.05 indicates a change of +7.6% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $92.16 billion and $96.79 billion estimates indicate +6.7% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $22.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.4%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.86 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.3%. The EPS surprise was +7.18%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

425,81f1540c-4696-3315-9b4c-533e8528d93b,PEP,2023-09-15,Buy These 5 S&P 500 Laggards of 2023 With Strong Upside Left,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-p-500-laggards-122700148.html,1694694420,STORY,"['HCA', '^GSPC', 'COMP', 'MCD', 'PEP', 'ADP']","[Wall Street has seen an impressive bull run in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.3%, 16.4% and 32%, respectively.Despite facing volatility in the past four weeks, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. However, several S&amp;P 500 components lagged the index to a big extent. A handful of those laggers are U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank. We have selected five such stocks that have vast upside left.Momentum Likely to ContinueThe inflation rate has been dwindling steadily since June 2022. The consumer price index of August came in at a three-month high. However, that was primarily due to higher energy prices. Moreover, the fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduced the possibility of a near-term recession.On Sep 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift from its rigorous interest rate hike policy, the Fed would restrain from a rate hike at this month’s FOMC meeting. Moreover, the journal reported that Fed officials are considering all aspects about whether more rate hikes are at all needed this year.At present, the Fed fund rate is in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The CME FedWatch tool is showing a 97% probability that the Fed will maintain a status quo in the September FOMC meeting, while a mere 3% chance is there that the rate will be hiked by 25 basis points.Athough the inflation rate is currently well above the Fed’s 2% target level, majority of Fed officials are of the view that further tightening of monetary policies may be detrimental to the economy. Monetary policy variables always affect the economy during a lag period. Therefore, Fed officials believe that the central bank should wait for the full effect of the current level of interest rate to be visible.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(CSCO): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cisco-systems-130012435.html,1694696412,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +6.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has gained 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $1.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.05 points to a change of +4.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.21 indicates a change of +4% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $14.61 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.2%. The $57.74 billion and $58.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.3% and +2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $15.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.04%. The EPS surprise was +7.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
