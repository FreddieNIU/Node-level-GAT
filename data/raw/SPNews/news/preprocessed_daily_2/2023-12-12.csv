Over a five-day period in March, three small to mid-sized banks failed, including Silicon Valley Bank (a subsidiary of SVB Financial), the largest bank failure since the Great Recession nearly 15 years ago.', ""The failures happened early this year and revealed how poorly prepared some banks were for today's high-interest rate environment. As we approach the end of the year, let's look back at some of the trends that upended the industry and weighed on many other stocks during the year and how the industry moves forward from here."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', 'In the years following the Great Recession, banks grew accustomed to a low-interest-rate environment. Lower interest rates can impact banks because they collect less net interest income, or the difference between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans. Higher rates can benefit banks because they help widen the net interest spread, which we saw last year as banks posted stellar net interest income growth.', 'However, some banks were ill-prepared for interest rates to go as high as they did, including Silicon Valley Bank. The start-up-focused bank invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities and other bonds during the low-yielding environment during the pandemic.', ""Usually, this wouldn't be a problem if it could hold the loans to maturity. However, it became a problem when its clientele, many start-ups and venture capital funds, saw funding dry up amid higher interest rates. Also, most of Silicon Valley Bank's deposits were non-interest-bearing and above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's $250,000 limit."", ""Clients began to pull money from the bank, triggering a nightmare scenario where Silicon Valley Bank needed to raise funds by selling underwater bonds or issuing stock, which the market didn't take too kindly to. We all know what happened next: Regulators seized the bank, and the Federal Reserve introduced the Bank Term Funding Program to help other banks that needed funding to prevent runs at other banks."", 'Generally, higher interest rates can benefit banks because they tend to cause net interest margins to expand. However, interest rates have risen rapidly since March 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate from near zero to 5.25%.', 'As a result, banks that rely on low-cost deposits saw those deposits outflow as customers moved their cash to higher-interest-earning assets, such as high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit.', 'One bank feeling the heat was Charles Schwab. From the start of 2022 through May of this year, Schwab saw its average bank account deposit balances fall by nearly $55 billion or 35%. Outflows at Schwab have slowed in recent months, but investors will still want to keep a close eye on deposit flows, especially if interest rates remain elevated.', 'US Banks Noninterest-bearing Deposits data by YCharts.', 'Declining deposits continue to impact banks like KeyCorp and Comerica, whose stocks were downgraded in August by the credit rating agency S&P Global.', ""Thus far, these banks have held up better than Silicon Valley Bank because their customer bases aren't as vulnerable. Still, banks will continue to face pressure and may have to raise interest rates on deposits to keep customers happy -- which will continue to put pressure on net interest margins."", ""The bank failures in the early half of the year were a warning to banks to get their financial houses in order. The Fed's Bank Term Funding Program helps banks shore up liquidity, but they shouldn't expect this program to be around forever."", ""In improving their balance sheets, banks have pulled back significantly from lending, especially to areas of the economy deemed higher risk. According to the Federal Reserve's October 2023 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, a significant amount of banks reported tightening lending standards on credit cards and other consumer loans. During this period, banks required higher income and were less likely to approve loan applications for those with lower credit scores."", ""Banks also tightened lending standards for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans to firms of all sizes in the quarter. Reduced lending to these firms means less capital for firms to hire and expand and also tends to mean that a recession isn't far off."", 'Banks have had a tough go of it this year. Since the start of the year, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSEMKT: KBE) has fallen nearly 5%, while the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSEMKT: KRE) has lost almost 17%. The struggle in banks brings to mind the classic quote from Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett: ""Only when the tide goes out do you discover who\'s been swimming naked.""', ""Banks will continue to face headwinds from the higher-interest-rate environment, although they may get some relief if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates next year. According to CME Group's FedWatch Tool, the market is pricing in five interest rate cuts by the end of next year."", 'However, today, banks continue to deal with high interest rates and tightening lending conditions, potentially leading to a recession in 2024.

Notwithstanding the positive inventory numbers, futures settled with a fifth consecutive loss week over week, overwhelmed by high production and predictions of insipid weather-related demand.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG."", 'Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 117 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec 1, above the guidance of a 105 Bcf withdrawal, per a survey conducted by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The decrease was also significantly more than the five-year (2018-2022) average net shrinkage of 48 Bcf and last year’s decline of 30 Bcf for the reported week.The latest draw puts total natural gas stocks at 3,719 Bcf, which is 254 Bcf (7.3%) above the 2022 level and 234 Bcf (6.7%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 110.7 Bcf per day, down 0.6 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to lower shipments from Canada and a slight decrease in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption fell to 118.1 Bcf from 127.5 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a drop in residential/commercial usage as well as lower power burn.', 'Natural gas prices trended downward last week despite the higher-than-expected inventory decrease. Futures for January delivery — which slumped to a three-and-a-half-month low earlier in the week — ended Friday at $2.581 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating some 8.3% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is the result of high supply and mild weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With mild weather across major parts of the United States and forecasts for above-normal temperature in the longer term, usage of the commodity to generate electricity is expected to be tepid.As it is, natural gas is under pressure from near-record output, with current inventory levels well above the year-ago figure and the five-year average. The full restart of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas is also likely to contribute significantly toward the global supply picture. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by a blast in June last year. It has been functioning only partially since its resumption in February. \xa0Having said all of that, there are signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down some 22% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, recently reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine.', 'Following last week’s decrease, the natural gas market is down more than 42% so far this year. Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably hold on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades. About 68% of the Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) company’s total output is natural gas.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Range Resources beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 33.6%. Valued at around $7.2 billion, RRC has gained 11.9% in a year.Coterra Energy: It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. The Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.8%. Valued at around $18.6 billion, CTRA has edged down 0.6% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 602.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked natural gas exporter’s 2023 earnings has been revised 17.3% upward over the past 60 days.

Since this decade began, the stock market's three major indexes have vacillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions."", ""Despite this volatility, the outlook for the semiconductor industry remains as bright as ever. Although forecasts vary wildly, depending on the source, one relative constant is the expectation that global semiconductor revenue will top $1 trillion, annually, by the turn of the decade. That's a lot of money to be divvied up among dozens of established and promising businesses."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', 'While some semiconductor stocks stand out as phenomenal values given their future growth prospects and competitive advantages, others appear priced for perfection in an imperfect and ever-evolving industry.', 'What follows are two semiconductor stocks that are surefire buys for the new year, as well as one high-flying chip stock investors may want to steer clear of.', ""Shares of central processing unit (CPU) juggernaut Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are higher by nearly 62% on a year-to-date basis through Dec. 8. While it's not the jaw-dropping value it was a year ago, there's plenty of reason for patient investors to be excited about its steady transition to a more diversified and higher-growth operating model."", 'It\'s no secret to anyone who owns shares of Intel or tracks it on their watchlist that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has been ""chipping"" away at its CPU lead. AMD has been successfully siphoning away share in personal computers (PCs) and data centers, which clearly has Wall Street concerned.', ""There also looks to be some skepticism on Wall Street regarding Intel's late entry into the artificial intelligence (AI) arena. Intel laid out plans to debut its Falcon Shores graphics processing unit (GPU) for AI-accelerated data centers in 2025. In the meantime, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPUs have run away with well over 80% of high-compute, data-center market share -- for the time being."", ""Despite skepticism surrounding Intel's near-term outlook, the company's stock looks like a bargain given the growth opportunities that lie ahead."", ""For example, the company's introduction of Falcon Shores by mid-decade should allow Intel to gobble up meaningful share in AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's growth has predominantly come on the heels of pricing power and GPU scarcity. Even with increased production in the upcoming year, there will be plenty of market share in play for 2025 and beyond. If Falcon Shores can be competitive with AMD's MI300X AI-GPU and Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs, there's no reason it can't snag meaningful share."", ""Additionally, Intel is diversifying its revenue channels by building out its foundry segment. It's spending approximately $20 billion to open two chip-fabrication facilities in Ohio next year, with a third plant set to open in Germany later this decade. By 2030, Intel could grow into the world's No. 2 chip foundry, which would almost certainly lift the company's operating margin."", ""Don't overlook Intel's still-dominant legacy segments, either. While PCs aren't the growth driver they once were, Intel is still the undisputed kingpin in CPUs for PCs and traditional data centers. These segments will remain cash cows for Intel, providing the company with ample cash to grow its foundry segment and invest in high-growth initiatives."", 'The second semiconductor stock that can confidently be bought hand over fist by investors in the new year is Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO).', 'Arguably the biggest knock against Qorvo is the expectation that global-smartphone sales will decline for a third consecutive year to approximately 1.34 billion units, which is a level not seen since 2014. Qorvo, which makes an assortment of wireless solutions, generated around three-quarters of its sales from smartphones/cellular products during its September-ended quarter.', ""Although tepid smartphone demand in 2023 is a tangible concern, there are a handful of reasons to be excited about the company's future."", 'To begin with, I believe the decline in smartphone sales will abate in the coming quarters. The expansion of 5G wireless networks worldwide should lead to a sustained smartphone upgrade cycle. Qorvo is responsible for some of the wireless solutions that make next-generation smartphones tick.', ""To add to the above, Qorvo has a very close working relationship with Apple, the largest smartphone company by market share in the United States. Apple's innovation has endeared generations of consumers to its products. As long as Qorvo components remain a staple in the iPhone, there's no reason to believe the company's bottom line won't grow over time."", ""But the juiciest growth opportunity for Qorvo is liable to come from its ancillary operations. In particular, Qorvo's wireless connectivity and power-management solutions could become staples in next-generation vehicles, including electric vehicles. As developed countries aim to minimize their carbon footprints, this shift to technology-enhanced, cleaner vehicles will be a tailwind for the company."", 'Lastly, Qorvo stock is cheap. Shares are currently trading for less than 14 times forward-year earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) expected to nearly double over the next four years.', 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""However, not all semiconductor stocks are necessarily going to be winners in the new year. The one I'd strongly suggest avoiding like the plague in 2024 is none other than the hottest megacap company on the planet, Nvidia."", ""As noted, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs account for the lion's share of AI-focused GPUs being utilized in high-compute data centers. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia is positioned to command more than 90% of the AI-GPU market in 2024. With Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing increasing its chip on wafer on substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have trouble meeting the needs of more of its enterprise customers moving forward."", ""But it's important to recognize that a lot of Nvidia's AI data-center gains this year were a function of A100 and H100 GPU scarcity and pricing power. Through the midpoint of Nvidia's fiscal year, which began on Jan. 30, 2023, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined as its sales soared. This is a clear indication that scarcity for its in-demand GPUs drove its growth."", ""Normally, strong pricing power is a welcome sight for a business and its investors. But this isn't going to be the case for Nvidia. With its own production ramping up, coupled with the arrival of AMD's MI300X GPU, it'll be considerably easier for businesses to get their hands on AI-accelerated GPUs in 2024 (and beyond). Nvidia will, undoubtedly, move more units, but its gross margin is going to suffer as its pricing power fades."", ""To add, Nvidia is facing regulatory pressure at home. U.S. regulators recently clamped down on AI chip exports to China, which is responsible for around 20% to 25% of the company's annual sales. Though Nvidia did develop less powerful versions of its leading A100 and H100 GPUs for export to the world's No. 2 economy, these restrictions could put a ceiling on Nvidia's near-term growth prospects."", ""History isn't on Nvidia's side, either. Every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has worked its way through an initial bubble phase, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to the rule. By the time Intel enters the arena with Falcon Shores in 2025, the industry will have somewhat matured. However, 2024 could be a difficult year for AI stocks if enterprise GPU demand fails to live up to investors' lofty expectations."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'Where should you invest $1,000 right now?', 'Citigroup is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Yet, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore believes that as the inventory correction runs its course over the coming months, the fundamentals for devices are “turning more positive.”', 'However, there’s a catch here. “In a perfect world,” notes the 5-star analyst, “that fundamental bottoming would be aligned with trough valuations.” But that is not the case, says Moore, given semis have bettered the overall market’s performance.', 'So, it’s time to be picky, and here, Moore recommends a “move to an overweight position in devices.” “While we still argue for being selective, the combination of recovering fundamentals and the importance of semiconductors in early stage AI argues for a higher than market weight exposure,” Moore explained. “Generally speaking, barring macro dislocation, we are past the bottom in some areas, and for most others, the bottom is in sight. Barring economic dislocation, things should improve over the course of 2024.”', 'So, with that in mind let’s now take a look at 3 semiconductor stocks Moore considers hot buys right now. We ran the trio through the\xa0TipRanks\xa0database\xa0to see what other\xa0experts make of these choices.', '‘Time to Upgrade,’ Says J.P. Morgan About These 2 Energy Stocks', 'TipRanks’ ‘Perfect 10’ Picks: 2 Top-Scoring Stocks for 2024', 'BMO Optimistic About Fintech Stocks in 2024; Here Are 3 Top Picks to Keep an Eye On', 'Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)', 'First on our list is Qorvo, the North Carolina-based large-cap chip designer and manufacturer that has its hands in all of the leading-edge high-tech markets. Qorvo’s core business, the products that make up the bulk of its output, are top-end radio frequency (RF) and power chipsets that provide solutions in a range of applications, from aerospace/defense to IoT to mobile networking to infrastructure and power management. These are expanding niches, that combine high demand with exacting specifications, requiring quality in execution.', 'Qorvo has been delivering that for the better part of three decades, and in recent years has been moving into 5G technology as well. The company’s 5G-enabled chips can be found in both the new wireless infrastructure and in the newer handsets and devices, where strong execution is required to ensure that the new systems are viable.', 'This company has a world-wide footprint, which exposes it to multiple headwinds – but also provides plenty of strength to offset them. Case in point, Qorvo is facing some pressure in the Chinese markets, where that country’s post-COVID recovery has grown somewhat muted recently. On the positive side, however, Qorvo finds meaningful support from its stable business with the defense industry, and its overall high-quality content story.', 'Looking at Qorvo’s recent financial performance, we find that the last reported quarter, fiscal 2Q24 (September quarter), showed a marked turnaround from the previous three quarters. The nine months ending with June 30 of this year saw a marked reduction in the company’s revenues and earnings, but the quarter ending on September 30 showed a return to higher levels at both the top and bottom lines.', 'In the report for 2Q of fiscal year 2024, Qorvo showed a top line of $1.1 billion, a total that was down 5.2% year-over-year but up 70% from Q1 – and beat the forecast by approximately $100 million. The company had a non-GAAP operating income of $279 million, or $2.39 per share; that EPS figure was 62 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company’s forward guidance for the quarterly ending this month, fiscal 3Q24, is upbeat, predicting revenue of $1 billion (compared to a consensus estimate of $991.8 million) and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.65 at the midpoint (compared to a $1.62 consensus).', 'This forms the background for Moore’s comments on Qorvo. He notes the potential for long-term earnings growth here, writing, “With the momentum from increased Apple share and snapback in China Android, Qorvo has enough GM expansion to get to $10+ EPS by CY2025. The stock currently trades at 10x CY25 EPS, which is on the lower end of their historical range and looks inexpensive given expectations of strong earnings growth. Valuation is going to remain at the lower end of US semis, given long term share pressure from China, high customer concentration, and modest smartphone growth, but from this level there is still material upside…”', 'Bottom-line, Moore bumps the stock’s rating from Equal-weight to Overweight (Buy). His price target, now set at $134 (up from $120), implies an upside of 29% for the year ahead. (To watch Moore’s track record, click here.)', 'Where Moore and Morgan Stanley are bullish, the Street generally is more cautious; the shares have a Hold consensus rating based on 17 recent analyst reviews with a breakdown of 11 Holds, and 3 Buys and Sells, each. The average price target is $102.62, suggesting the shares will stay rangebound for the time being. (See Qorvo’s stock forecast.)', 'Ambarella (AMBA)', 'Next up is Ambarella, a $2.3 billion fabless chip company that lies squarely in the small- to mid-cap category. Ambarella specializes in designing, testing, marketing, and selling its chipsets, producing prototypes and contracting the regular production line runs to dedicated chip foundries. It’s a division-of-labor model that has worked well in the semiconductor industry.', 'On its own end, Ambarella works in the video application niche, creating chipsets that that are optimized for image processing and high-resolution video compression. The company’s products are found in a wide range of digital imaging technologies and systems, from wearable cameras to vehicle dash-cams, to pocket sized digital stills and video cameras to driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicle ‘eyes.’ The common factor among these applications is a need for high definition video at low power – a specialty niche that Ambarella has filled well.', 'This has resulted in a line of chips designed specifically for battery-powered devices, where power consumption is a primary concern. Ambarella’s products are known for outperforming in power efficiency, sometimes by a factor of 5 or more, while continuing to provide superior results in picture clarity and file compression. It all comes down to the proven quality of Ambarella’s low-power systems-on-chip high-quality video and image resolution.', 'Despite the company’s leading role in a growing niche, AMBA shares have lost heavily in the past year. The stock is down approximately 27% in the last 12 months, and earnings have been running negative for several quarters. The decline came as customer firms were working to clear out old inventory, resulting in lower demand for new products. At the end of November, however, Ambarella’s fiscal 3Q24 results (October quarter), while down y/y, beat the forecast at the top and bottom lines.', 'The company’s revenue total was $50.6 million for fiscal Q3, down 39% from the previous year’s quarter but sliding in some $590,000 above expectations. The bottom-line earnings figure came to a loss of 28 cents per share by non-GAAP measures; this was 11 cents per share narrower than had been anticipated.', 'Turning to Moore’s view, we find the analyst setting this stock up as one of his favorite SMID chip firms. Moore is bullish on the risk-reward and the long-term potential to beat the headwinds, saying of the company, “For investors looking for SMID exposure, we continue to prefer AMBA on their long-term risk reward. We see high strategic value in AMBA’s technology over the long term, which we believe will support meaningful upside in the future. However, we do remain cautious near term as they are currently in the middle of a severe inventory correction and are seeing market share pressure in their legacy video. We expect headwinds in their legacy surveillance business to ease next year, and remain positive on the importance of the technology solutions the company provides long term.”', 'Moore rates these shares as Overweight (a Buy), with a $67 price target to point toward a 16% one-year upside potential.', 'This stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 11 recent reviews that include 7 Buys to 3 Holds to 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $57.82 and the average target price of $72.78 implies a gain of 26% on the one-year horizon. (See Ambarella’s stock forecast.)', 'Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI)', 'Last on our list today is Analog Devices, a chip company that holds a solid position in the signal processing and data conversion segment. Analog’s product portfolio includes a wide range of chipsets, used in applications as varied as motor and motion control, power monitoring, clocks and timing devices, amplifiers, switches and multiplexes, and industrial ethernet solutions – and that is only a partial list.', 'Analog’s strategy, avoiding specialization but opting to fill a wide range of applications for its products, has paid off. The company boasts the largest market cap on this list of Morgan Stanley picks – in excess of $91 billion – and realized some $12 billion in sales last year. From an investor perspective, this is a lucrative stock, that has returned $19 billion to shareholders over the past decade.', 'A significant portion of that shareholder return comes from the company’s dividend payment, which was last declared for a December 14 payment. That payment is scheduled at 86 cents per share, or $3.44 annualized. While this gives a forward yield of just 1.86%, it’s important to note that the company has a history of consistent dividend payments and boasts of 19 straight years of dividend growth.', 'In its last quarterly report, covering fiscal Q423 (October quarter), Analog reported a top line revenue total of $2.7 billion; this represented a 16.3% y/y drop but was in-line with analyst expectations. The bottom line, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of $2.01 per share, was a penny below the forecast. The company had an operating cash flow of $4.8 billion, a free cash flow of $3.6 billion, and returned $4.6 billion to shareholders during the fiscal fourth quarter.', 'In his coverage for MS, top analyst Moore points out that ADI shares are a sound choice for investors looking to pick up a resilient stock with a history of outperforming downcycles. He writes, “ADI has outperformed peers in the past 3 downcycles, as gross margin has stayed resilient through cycle, and we expect the company to exhibit gross margin resilience through this current downcycle. The company has relatively higher ASP products which should limit direct competition with emerging Chinese capacity. Their latest earnings gave us further confidence that this current downturn should bottom in Q2 2024: the company has seen sequential improvement in bookings and pointed towards stabilization, cancellations are down meaningfully for the first time in close to a year, and inventory digestion accelerated at their largest customer.”’', 'Moore goes on to put an Overweight (Buy) rating here, along with a $219 price target to imply an 18% gain in the next 12 months.', 'Zooming out a bit, we find that ADI gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Street’s consensus, a view based on 18 calls – 13 to Buy and 5 to Hold. ADI shares are priced at $184.88 and their $200.88 average target price indicates room for a 8.5% one-year upside potential.

Often thought to be under the domain of science fiction, A.I. systems are now making their way to consumers and companies and have injected stocks of companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with steroids.', ""At the heart of the current A.I. revolution is OpenAI. The San Francisco, California based firm's ChatGPT caught the public imagination after its release, and OpenAI's GPT-4 A.I. model is believed to be one of the most advanced models of its kind in the world. However, before OpenAI became a household name, it was eagerly developing its software and consulting with Mr. Gates. While you might believe A.I. is all hype and no substance, Mr. Gates begs to differ. His first foray with GUIs in 1980 had stunned him into action, and according to him, A.I. is the second time in his life that he has come across such a technology."", ""Don't believe us? Well, take a look at what Mr. Gates wrote in March 2023:"", 'The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface—the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows. I sat with the person who had shown me the demo, a brilliant programmer named Charles Simonyi, and we immediately started brainstorming about all the things we could do with such a user-friendly approach to computing. Charles eventually joined Microsoft, Windows became the backbone of Microsoft, and the thinking we did after that demo helped set the company’s agenda for the next 15 years.', 'The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team from OpenAI since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.', ""Safe to say, if Bill Gates thinks that A.I. in 2023 is the biggest disruptor in the technology industry since the point and click principle of today's operating systems, then there might be more to the technology than A.I.'s biggest detractors believe. However, another individual that has played a key role in today's A.I. wave is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Mr. Musk is one of OpenA's original followers, and after Gates shared in March that A.I. was the second biggest surprise of his career, Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his opinion that Gates' understanding of A.I. was limited back when OpenAI's earliest meetings took place in 2016 and that his knowledge is still limited."", ""Yet, since his retirement from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Gates has been dabbling in a lot more industries apart from A.I. His foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invests in publicly traded companies and awards grants to others that have the potential of solving the world's greatest problems such as hunger, renewable energy, and disease. One such firm that Mr. Gates himself founded is TerraPower. He set up the company in 2008 and still continues to serve as its chairman. TerraPower is a nuclear power company that is developing next generation nuclear reactors that are called traveling wave reactors (TRWs). Conventional nuclear reactors cannot just use uranium that's been mined from the ground. Instead, uranium is enriched first, which creates an entirely new supply chain. TRWs plan to use un-enriched uranium, and TerraPower scored a win at the COP28 conference held in the U.A.E. as the U.A.E.'s state owned nuclear firm ENEC shared that it has signed an MOU with TerraPower to invest the deployment of advanced reactors in the U.A.E. and globally."", ""So, as 2024 comes to a close, seems like Bill Gates can't do anything wrong. Therefore, we thought to take a look at which of his other stock picks are also popular among billionaire investors. Some notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

While the AI boom lifted stock valuations of a handful of companies to new highs, some notable analysts believe the market has a lot of room to run next year. Jordan Jackson, JP Morgan Asset Management global market strategist, recently said while talking to Bloomberg that there’s a lot of money locked in money market funds that could be injected in equities next year after investors gain confidence. Jackson said that earnings this year have been stronger than expected. The analyst said that the “buying spree” will continue next year.', 'Answering a question about his thoughts on calls from some analysts expecting the market to hit new highs next year, Jackson said that the market could indeed hit new highs in 2024, especially if big names continue to gain value.', 'The questioner was asking Jackson specifically about Deutsche Bank’s analyst Binky Chadha, who is now one of Wall Street’s biggest bulls as he expects the S&P 500 to hit 5,100 points by the end of 2024.', 'Given this backdrop of optimism, it’s high time for investors to find stocks that are truly undervalued.

British American Tobacco Plc (NYSE:BTI) took a whopping $31.5 billion non-cash adjusting impairment charge to account for the new brand values.', 'After the latest sell-off, many analysts issued bullish commentary on the stock, calling the recent dip a buying opportunity.

This quarter, we exited the position completely, swapping our exposure for\xa0British American Tobacco p.l.c.\xa0(NYSE:BTI), as the valuation gap became too hard to ignore. Investors are rightly frustrated with the stock. In addition to the menthol ban, leadership change, and North Korea kerfuffle. BTI has mountains of debt piled on its balance sheet following the acquisition of Reynolds, which will limit options for capital allocation, namely more buybacks.

This stress test models a dramatic recession—one meaningfully worse than the great financial crisis of 2008-2009. It includes a 3.5% decline in gross domestic product, a 10% unemployment rate, a 37% decline in residential real estate, a 40% decline in commercial real estate and a 55% decline in the stock market. The resilience and strength required to weather such an economic storm combined with proven economies of scale in branding and technology should drive DNYVF market share gains and growth for years to come.

The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth.

However, as of April 2023, there was a significant decrease in the average benefit to $181.7 per person and $343 per household. This sharp decline from February's averages suggests the conclusion of additional benefits provided during the pandemic. The amount allocated to SNAP recipients by state can also vary, taking into account factors such as the recipient's income and expenses, as well as the other received benefits. In 2022, the United States witnessed an alarming one-year increase in its poverty rate, reaching 12.4%, up from 7.4% in 2021. As of 2022, around 37.9 million individuals found themselves living below the poverty line.

Nash says partnerships with Walmart (WMT), Doordash (DASH), and other retailers enable further reach. She notes Wing looks to grow in new metro areas with partners, building on success serving urban communities.', ""However, Nash highlights opportunity for more everyday household items and grocery deliveries.

What did you find?"", ""SHANNON NASH: You know, we found that 74% of the folks that we surveyed really saw a need for this instant fast-mile delivery. And we're talking about things like it's the holiday party, everything is ready, you're about to set the table, and somebody we won't name who forgot the dinner rolls. And it's going to take, you know, at least 30 minutes to an hour to make that happen."", ""We're seeing a lot of customers saying that for this fast-mile delivery, they're looking at things like groceries. In fact, 43% said that they would use this service for last-minute groceries, and then another 23% said they would use it for those gifts. You can't go to the party with an empty hand, so you know, gifts are also something very popular among customers."", 'DIANE KING HALL: Shannon, first I want to congratulate you. I saw the note today with the CFO of the Year by Datarails in the tech category. So congratulations are in order. Next, I want to ask you about the expansion strategy for Wing. Obviously, there is not-- there are not a lot of players in the drone delivery space. So what is your market expansion strategy, especially when you compete against the likes of an Amazon?', ""SHANNON NASH: Well, Diane, we've done over 350,000 deliveries. We've operated in three continents. In Australia, in Europe we were in Finland, and now we're in Ireland, and then in the United States, we started in Virginia, and now we are in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with Walmart.

I know there can be some challenges when you think about, say, urban or rural areas. How are you all surmounting those challenges, or addressing those challenges?', ""SHANNON NASH: Yeah. We started, as I mentioned, in an urban area in the United States in a place called Christiansburg, Virginia, which is very close to Virginia Tech. And I'm a UVA grad, so you know, we're rivals but I'm very happy that that's where we started our business. And what we found Diane is, you know, we have actually a couple that won the world record for the most drone deliveries in a rural area, if you will."", ""They've done over 1,000 deliveries. And the number one thing that they ordered, they'd ordered a lot of food. But the thing that surprised me the most is they ordered almost 100 boxes of Girl Scout cookies, so there's a lot of uses in the urban area. And then of course, as I mentioned before, we've expanded, particularly in Australia with DoorDash, and that's in more urban environments. And we are in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Frisco, Texas with Walmart in a more urban area, and we've been able to show that our drones are able to meet both environments.""]"

', ""Ray Dalio is a guru in the finance industry and one of the richest people in the world. His latest net worth is estimated to sit at $15.4 billion, which makes him one of the richest investment managers around. Additionally, Mr. Dalio's financial firm, Bridgewater Associates operates an investment portfolio that is worth billions of dollars. Insider Monkey's research, which looked at the total value of the fund's investment holdings filed with the SEC, discovered that Bridgewater's third quarter of 2023 investment portfolio was worth $16.5 billion - almost equal to the net worth of Mr. Dalio himself!"", ""The billionaire investor is also one of the oldest in the world - not because of his age but because of the time that has elapsed since he started to invest. Ray Dalio's first stock purchase came when he was just 12 years old. He started investing after working at a golf club where he regularly interacted with Wall Street Professionals. Dalio would continue to invest throughout his school days, after which he would first get a bachelor's degree in finance and then secure his MBA from the illustrious Harvard Business School."", ""His first professional stint in the finance industry would see Mr. Dalio turn his focus towards commodities instead of stocks and two years after graduating from Harvard, he set up Bridgewater Associates. Bridgewater is one of the biggest financial firms in the world, and its assets under management (AUM) stood at $126 billion as of June 202 end. When compared to other hedge funds that primarily employ strategies such as long/short, Bridgewater focuses on broader economic trends and their impacts on the stock market. In today's environment, which has seen interest rates sit at record high levels and markets suffer the consequences, this strategy is quite relevant."", ""Bridgewater's size and scale place it right at the top of the world's financial experts and the firm regularly shares its insights with outsiders through research newsletters. In 2023, the hottest technology was artificial intelligence which caught the public imagination and took analysts and investors by storm. A.I., simply put, is a collection of math formulas that sift through data to form conclusions. This makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications such as drug discovery, fraud detection, and supply chain management. The potential for A.I. to be ubiquitous is a major reason why A.I. related stocks have soared this year with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by 231% year to date."", 'Bridgewater\'s co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen shared the progress that his firm\'s Artificial Intelligence Associate (AIA) labs have made when it comes to analyzing A.I.\'s disruptive potential. His conclusions boil down to what several folks already understand about A.I. The research shows that A.I. has overcome the ability to perform on difficult aptitude tests such as the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). However, Bridgewater shares that while A.I. can perform well on the tests, it is still limited when it comes to making the decisions that the professionals working in the field would make. However, the financial firm is also bullish on A.I. as it notes that these limitations will be overcome over the next couple of years, and by then A.I. might very well perform better than humans can on several ""cognitive applications"".', 'The firm goes on to see what impact A.I. can have on white collar applications and it adds:', 'If AI can perform economically valuable cognitive tasks at very little marginal cost, it could similarly open up new horizons for spending and economic activity. The selling prices of many products will likely fall as AI brings their marginal costs down to zero, even where firms have strong pricing power (as these firms will often maximize profits by increasing sales volumes at lower prices).', 'In some cases, we will see a “Model T effect”: consumers buying a lot more when the price of a previously unaffordable item is slashed, causing entire new industries to spring up. Around the turn of the 20th century, the revolutionary assembly line process used to produce the Ford Model T lowered the cost of manufacturing a car so much (and so quickly) that a whole new market for mass-market cars came into being. AI could similarly make a host of previously high-cost items very cheap to provide, such as tailored legal advice, customized software builds, individualized financial planning, and one-on-one tutoring. Consumption of these kinds of cognitive services could balloon, though pricing power considerations will ultimately determine whether the gains end up primarily with providers as profits or consumers as surplus.', ""Switching gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen investors grow increasingly optimistic about the Fed finally reducing interest rates.

However, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales may have shifted the narrative. And it also appears to have caught the bears on the wrong side of the trade.', 'Notably, The Wall Street Journal reported that the day after Thanksgiving represented a bonanza for so-called holiday stocks. Yes, overall, Americans are hurting. However, the WSJ pointed out that shoppers are increasingly financing their purchases via buy now, pay later (BNPL) platforms. Now, that might be problematic down the line. However, for now, the message is that consumers will do what is necessary to keep retail therapy alive.', 'Moreover, Forbes reported that Cyber Monday sales also hit fresh records. Again, we’re seeing a familiar theme that households are doing whatever they can to participate in the festivities. It also demonstrates an uncompromising attitude that bolsters certain Black Friday stock winners.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'For a heads up, I’m basing a large portion of my argument on short-covering speculation. So, that’s a topic you may want to read up on to get the most out of these retail stocks.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational consumer electronics retailer, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) in the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic benefited from the retail revenge phenomenon. However, 2022 represented an entirely different story, with skyrocketing inflation taking the air out of demand for consumer discretionary items. After all, with consumers sating themselves in prior years, there wasn’t as much of a point to gorge last year.', 'However, after consumers adjusted to the new normal of monetary policy, BBY suddenly appears as one of the enticing retail stocks. To be sure, analysts don’t really like it, rating it a consensus hold with a $72.62 average price target. At time of writing, this view symbolizes about 1% downside risk. However, you’ve got to respect the recent performance. In the trailing month, BBY gained almost 11% of equity value.', 'Looking at Fintel’s options flow screener – which filters exclusively for big block transactions likely made by institutions – we see that major entities have sold calls. One option in particular, the Jan 19 ’24 75.00 Call, seems risky for the bulls because it’s about to get blown up.', 'With BBY priced at $73.42, it could be an early Christmas gift for the bulls.', 'Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the most popular big-box retailers, Target (NYSE:TGT) earlier this year appeared quite problematic. In fact, in May of this year, I warned investors away from TGT via my TipRanks article. I suggested that organized retail crime – which remains a problem for Target and its ilk – imposes a dark cloud over the business. Looking at the share price performance, I’m glad I made that call.', 'However, TGT may now be one of the retail stocks to buy. Sure, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $151.04 price target, implying 12% growth. Still, the overall assessment is quite split: 14 buys, 13 holds. That doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. And it’s fair to point out that TGT is still down 11% since the January opener. Nevertheless, you’ve got to respect the near-term performance.', 'In the trailing month, Target shares jumped more than 21%, sparked by a surprisingly robust third-quarter earnings report. Still, options flow data shows that some major parties are still bearish on TGT. Notably, I’m looking at the sold Dec 29 ’23 130.00 Call options. With TGT priced at nearly $135, the call writers (sellers) are getting blown up. Cynically, TGT represents one of the holiday stocks to consider.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Fundamentally, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) in my view makes an almost no-brainer case for retail stocks to buy. It’s a chain of specialty discount stores so that alone makes the company incredibly relevant. After all, we don’t know what might appear on the economic horizon. Even better, Five Below doesn’t sell the typical dollar-store junk. Rather, by extending the prices up to five bucks, consumers get more product diversity.', 'Also, Five Below sells a select range of products that price between $6 to $25. Therefore, the company stands to attract shoppers beyond those who must patronize discount chains out of necessity. Besides, everyone loves a good bargain, no matter where it’s from. So, it’s not a shocker to see FIVE carry a consensus strong buy rating. What might be off-putting, though, is the average price target of $216.92.', 'That only implies upside of less than 9%, which might be too low. While FIVE incurred much choppiness this year, it’s been on a strong run recently. In the trailing month, FIVE gained over 13% of market value. It has the makings of one of the Black Friday stock winners due to the relevance of the business.', 'Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the riskier ideas among retail stocks to speculate on, Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) under ordinary circumstances wouldn’t arouse much controversy. As a retailer that sells premium kitchenware and home furnishings, Williams-Sonoma benefits from a higher-income consumer base. So, in theory, WSM should be better insulated from economic headwinds.', 'To be sure, the controversy over WSM isn’t so much that “this time, it’s different.” No, if anything, this time, it’s the same. Since the start of the year, WSM skyrocketed nearly 72%. That’s so much better than other holiday stocks as you’ve no doubt witnessed. Therefore, Wall Street rates WSM a hold but with a $166.29 average price target. From the time of writing, that target implies a loss of 15%.', 'So, in perhaps any other circumstance, WSM should be an idea to be dumped. I mean, in the trailing month, it’s gone up over 28%. However, the bulls are determined to blow up bearish positions, particularly the Feb 16 ’24 185.00 Call. And there are other bearish bets that could also suffer a reckoning.', 'So, WSM just might be one of the sustained Black Friday stock winners.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'If you’re looking for retail stocks to bet on amid a possible shift in consumer spending behaviors, Kimco (NYSE:KIM) appears a wise idea. Structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Kimco specializes in grocery-anchored, open-air shopping centers. Naturally, this directive enjoys relevance because let’s face it – no matter how advanced we become as a society, we must have access to nutritional sustenance.', 'Even better, Kimco recognizes – amid all the uncertainty – the viability of this no-nonsense protocol. Earlier this year, the company boosted its grocery-anchored portfolio with a key acquisition. Now, it did suffer some negative rumblings, with shares still finding themselves below breakeven for the year. However, as I’ve stated earlier, you’ve got to respect the near-term performance.', 'In the trailing one-month period, KIM gained over 8% of equity value. Nevertheless, a major entity (or entities) sold 2,303 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 20.00 Call last Friday. That seems like an unadvisable wager. At the time of the transaction, KIM stock traded at $19.90. By the close, it was at $20.05 and really showing no signs of stopping.', 'It also pays a forward dividend yield of 4.79%. Therefore, it’s one of the holiday stocks to consider.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'If the year had ended on Nov. 13, department store giant Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) would look an ineffective investment. As mentioned earlier, consumers had suffered heavily from inflation and rising interest rates. With one of the easiest mitigation protocols centering on putting the scissors to discretionary purchases, Nordstrom seemed doomed. However, it redeemed itself beautifully.', 'For its Q3 earnings report, the company posted earnings per share of 25 cents, beating the consensus view of 12 cents. Revenue did miss but slightly, coming in at $3.32 billion against the expected $3.4 billion. Still, after some digestion, Wall Street appreciated the report, sending JWN higher. In the trailing one-month period, the security swung up over 11%, perhaps making it one of the Black Friday stock winners.', 'But can this momentum continue forward? Analysts don’t think so, rating JWN a hold with a $15.73 average price target, thus implying almost 3% downside risk. Under normal circumstances, JWN should arguably be a sell. However, the bulls are hungry.', 'Specifically, they may be looking to really blow up the sold Jan 19 ’24 15.00 Call. With JWN still running hot at over $16, this may be among the retail stocks to speculate on.', 'Source: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.com', 'Another iconic department store, Macy’s (NYSE:M) also represented one of the retail stocks that benefited from the retail revenge phenomenon. However, that momentum stopped in late 2021 as the realities of blisteringly hot inflation dominated the public discourse. Add the spiked interest rates and subsequent mass layoffs and consumers simply had little reason to spend unnecessarily.', 'Sure enough, M stock is still trying to recover what was lost. Since the beginning of the year, the company lost about 15% of equity value. However, this negative print ignores the fact that the recent performance has been phenomenal. In the trailing five sessions, it jumped over 15%. And in the past 30 days, M shares returned stakeholders almost 37%.', 'Undergirding sentiment was the company’s Q3 earnings report, which posted better-than-expected results. Additionally, management reaped the rewards associated with improved margins, cost cuts and reduced inventory. Subsequently, institutional investors began buying call options in large volumes, betting on a sustained rally.', 'However, bears have also sold calls, especially the Jun 21 ’24 13.00 Call. With shares priced at more than $17 and showing little sign of slowing, the bears may have bitten off more than they can chew.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Should You Buy?,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-nyse-crm-growth-234953030.html,1702338593,STORY,['CRM'],"['Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), the leading CRM solutions provider in the world, is proving to be a big winner in AI technology. The company’s growth is expected to accelerate, driven by the increased adoption of AI-enabled CRM solutions and revenue diversification efforts. Salesforce’s increasing focus on distributing excess cash to shareholders makes it even more attractive. However, Salesforce’s current valuation accounts for most of the expected growth. For this reason, I am neutral on Salesforce stock.', 'Salesforce has experienced a deceleration in growth since the second quarter of Fiscal 2022. From 21.77% in Q2 2022, the company’s revenue growth rate fell to 11.3% in Q3 2023, highlighting the impact of macroeconomic challenges the software industry is facing today. A deeper dive into the company’s recent performance, however, reveals several bright spots.', 'First, Salesforce’s focus on improving profitability is already yielding promising results. The company’s cost reduction strategy has played a key role since mid-2022 to improve the company’s profit margins. In the third quarter, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue declined by 600 basis points year-over-year, boosting CRM’s GAAP operating margin to 17.2%. For context, in Q3 2022, its operating margin was a meager 6%.', 'Due to macroeconomic challenges such as surging inflation, interest rate hikes, and lingering fears of a recession, many businesses have curtailed spending on IT projects. This is one of the main reasons behind the decelerating revenue growth rates seen by Salesforce in recent quarters. In the next phase of the business cycle – which may begin as soon as 2024 – revenue growth trends are likely to reverse. Salesforce, as a company with a better cost structure, will see a notable improvement in profitability once this happens.', 'Second, Salesforce is successfully diversifying its revenue base, which ensures the long-term sustainability of growth. The company, which was incorporated in 1999 with the sole objective of sales force automation, has added new products and services in the last couple of decades to cater to the diverse requirements of customers.', 'Today, the company offers six clouds: Sales Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Experience Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud, and Analytics Cloud. In addition to these, the company provides platform solutions while integrating its Tableau and Slack acquisitions.', 'The company is focused on offering packaged solutions involving a few of these clouds, which seems the right strategy to hook clients for the long term. In the third quarter, nine of the top 10 deals completed by the company included at least six clouds, which is a testament to the growing popularity of the additional services offered by Salesforce.', 'MuleSoft, which provides integration solutions for connecting applications, data, and devices, is proving to be a strong growth driver for the company. In Q3, MuleSoft was included in eight of the top 10 deals completed by Salesforce. By using MuleSoft, organizations can automate workflows, enhance efficiency, and improve the overall agility of their operations.', 'In an era where automation is taking center stage, MuleSoft will continue to be in high demand in the foreseeable future, further helping Salesforce’s revenue diversification efforts.', 'Third, Salesforce is integrating AI into many of its clouds, improving the user experience and the efficiency of its customers. AI investments are likely to pay off handsomely in the long run with the global business world embracing automated solutions.', 'Einstein Platform is the flagship AI product developed by Salesforce, which encompasses a suite of AI-powered features embedded across various Salesforce products. This platform provides unique solutions, such as AI-enabled business intelligence tools, AI-powered applications for image recognition and natural language processing, and AI-enabled marketing solutions, such as predictive lead scoring.', 'Salesforce enjoys first-mover advantages in many of these technologies, which paints a promising picture of what the future holds for the company. Technological superiority will help the company enjoy durable competitive advantages, which, in turn, will lead to economic profits.', 'Finally, Salesforce is beginning to reward shareholders through share buybacks as the company continues to generate free cash flows even while investing in AI aggressively. In the third quarter alone, the company repurchased $1.9 billion worth of shares, completing $10 billion worth of buybacks in the last five quarters. The company first started repurchasing shares in the third quarter of 2022.', 'During the third-quarter earnings call, Salesforce President and CFO Amy Weaver pledged that the company is planning to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation through share repurchases. She went on to project the outstanding share count of the company to decline for the first time in the upcoming fiscal year.', 'Overall, Salesforce looks well-positioned to grow, aided by its recent AI investments and revenue diversification efforts. At the same time, its profitability potential looks promising, thanks to the success of its restructuring efforts.', 'Salesforce stock is up by a staggering 85% this year. Even on the back of this stellar market performance, many analysts continue to view the company as attractively valued.', 'After digesting Q3 earnings, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Mark Murphy reiterated his Buy rating for the company and boosted the price target to $260 from $240, citing AI tailwinds. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts also boosted their price target for Salesforce from $280 to $300, noting the continued improvements in MuleSoft and Tableau offerings alongside core product sales growth.', 'Based on the ratings of 39 Wall Street analysts, the average Salesforce stock price target is $275, which implies upside of 10.5% from the current market price.', 'Still, a closer look at the company’s valuation suggests much of the expected growth is already priced in today. Salesforce is valued at a price-to-sales multiple of 7.2 compared to the five-year average of 8.34. At a time when growth is decelerating, it makes sense for the company to trade at a discount to its historical valuation levels.', 'Although AI investments will continue to drive growth in the coming years, it will take time for the company to reach historical levels of revenue growth because of lingering macroeconomic challenges.', 'Salesforce is executing its growth plans well, with the company expanding into new business verticals and markets while maintaining profitability. The company’s buyback program is also attractive. However, based on valuation concerns, investors may have to wait for a better opportunity to invest in the company.', 'Disclosure']"

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PG&E ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for PG&E is:', '7.5% = US$1.8b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see PG&E has a similar ROE to the average in the Electric Utilities industry classification (8.3%)."", ""That isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 2 risks we have identified for PG&E visit our risks dashboard for free."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', ""PG&E clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.24. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.', 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

It's crucial."", 'I know all investors are trying to make money. But there are several different paths to get there. Consider investing great Warren Buffett, for example. His path follows his No. 1 rule: ""Never lose money.""', 'This is actually a different approach than The Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner. He calls his approach ""losing to win."" He\'s looking for investment ideas with much higher upside. He accepts that many of these stocks will lose money. But he holds on to his winners for the long haul, allowing them to compound and more than make up for the losers.', ""Don't get me wrong, I believe Buffett has earned the title of greatest investor of all time. But Gardner has been quite successful as well. And yet they're playing slightly different games. Buffett takes a more concentrated-portfolio approach, centered around stocks with high probabilities of positive returns. Gardner takes a more diversified-portfolio approach, centered around businesses with a lot of promise but still a lot to prove."", 'When it comes to Millennial and Gen Z investors, I believe many would improve their results by taking an honest look at their game plans. And a 2022 research report illustrates why I feel this way.', 'According to a 2022 report from The Motley Fool, 40% of Millennial and Gen Z investors hold so-called meme stocks in their investment accounts.', ""There's no definitive definition of a meme stock. Think of it as investors using the power of the internet to rally other investors to a particular stock symbol. They hope their collective buying pressure will push the stock price up. It's worked at times. But normally the benefit is short-lived."", 'And that right there is the biggest problem with the meme-stock movement.', ""You see, Buffett and Gardner are playing different games but they're both winners because they still use the same strategy: They're both buy-and-hold long-term investors. This matters because compounding works its magic the longer the game is played."", 'In his bestselling book The Psychology of Money, author Morgan Housel expounded on this point when he wrote:', ""Good investing isn't necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can't be repeated. It's about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That's when compounding runs wild."", ""I'm not saying that investors can't make significant money in the short term with meme stocks. They can. But there's not a process they can consistently repeat to allow compound returns to work for them, the way that Buffett and Gardner do."", ""I suspect that investors are attracted to meme stocks because they're usually consumer-facing businesses (well known) and they're hoping for high upside. For this reason, I've compiled three potential alternatives here that are also well-known businesses. And they have strong long-term upside potential. However, they're also financially sound companies, unlike a lot of meme stocks, which mitigates some of the downside risk."", 'The first company is Align Technology (NASDAQ: ALGN), maker of the well-known Invisalign braces. The company also has 3D mouth-scanning devices used by doctors to develop treatment plans. Overall, Align has a portfolio of nearly 1,700 patents, which has doubled in the last five years, to protect itself from competition.', ""Net revenue in 2023 for Align Technology has been slow-growing -- through the first three quarters, net revenue is up less than 3% from the comparable period of 2022. But it's not like teeth-straightening treatments are becoming obsolete. To the contrary, there's always new cohorts of kids and teens needing orthodontic attention. The business is simply in a slow period."", ""Align Technology remains profitable and has a debt-free balance sheet, meaning it's financially strong. And the stock is cheap right now at about four times its trailing sales -- that's close to its lowest valuation this decade, as the chart below shows."", 'ALGN PS Ratio data by YCharts', ""The market has tossed out Align Technology stock because of its slow growth. But a strong network of 252,000 doctors and a portfolio of proprietary products make me believe Align stock has long-term upside, especially at today's price."", ""For investors who haven't yet seen beverages from Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH) at the store, just be patient because they could be in stock soon. The brand's popularity is soaring because consumers perceive these energy drinks to be better for you. And a distribution deal with PepsiCo in late 2022 sent its expansion into overdrive, which is why more investors could see these drinks on shelves in coming months."", ""Here's how much Pepsi's distribution has catalyzed Celsius' growth: This is the first full year of the partnership. And revenue for the first three quarters of 2023 is up 104% from the same period of 2022. To be clear, this isn't a high growth rate because the business is small. Year to date, the company has generated nearly $1 billion in revenue. Growth is just legitimately that good."", ""It could be tempting to think that Pepsi's distribution has already provided a boost to Celsius, with future benefits modest. However, it's possible that the company's growth is just getting started."", ""Consider that only 3.5% of Celsius' revenue in the third quarter of 2023 was derived from international markets -- Pepsi can help it grow overseas. Moreover, Pepsi is getting Celsius in the door at many restaurant chains, such as Jersey Mikes and Dunkin' Donuts. More restaurant chains could follow."", 'Celsius is firing on all cylinders and there are still plenty of untapped markets to give investors long-term upside.', ""Finally, with 482 million global monthly active users, image-browsing platform Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is another well-known business. And like these other two companies, it's also in great financial shape with a debt-free balance sheet and $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities."", ""Pinterest generates revenue by displaying ads, and a recent partnership with e-commerce giant Amazon could supercharge its growth and profits. The two companies are working together to display ads on Pinterest from Amazon's merchants. And the idea is that this can lead to better ad relevance and sales conversions."", ""The more effective Pinterest's ads are, the more demand there will likely be and rates can consequently increase as well. But the company's arrangement with Amazon is key for profits too. Rather than dedicate manpower toward hundreds of smaller merchants, Pinterest can deal directly with massive Amazon. This potentially lowers operating expenses while still providing that top-line boost."", ""I can't guarantee that these three stocks will go up. But Align, Celsius, and Pinterest all have similar attributes. They're well known, they're financially sound, and they still have growth opportunities. Using a framework like this, or something else, can lead to a repeatable process in finding investment ideas. And by sticking to a process for the long term, investors can let compounding work in their favor."", 'And compounding is what makes disparate investing game plans work.', 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'Where should you invest $1,000 right now?', ""John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, Cloud Services and License Support is now 74% of the revenue, and its recurring revenue and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen and it's happening. And as this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year. To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just 3 years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we kept talking about it, and we knew it was only a matter of time. And now more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services. Our financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads, given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle cloud infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things, creating the second-generation cloud enabled us to building much better, more scalable and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently. Second, we know what it takes to run an enterprise scale, performance and security better than, I'd say, anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission-critical systems. Third, we recognized that customers need deployment flexibility. Rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated Cloud at Customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds and Alloy, our partner cloud. And then finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry-changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out with total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and EPS at the high end of guidance. Now as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance 3 months ago. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50% and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud application, autonomous database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and were up 19%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which include License Support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 infrastructure Cloud Services revenue grew 55% with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40% and autonomous database up 26%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4%, including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner. Now shifting to margins. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 78%. This is because of the mix between Support and Cloud, in which Cloud is growing much faster than Support, Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. While we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To this point, the gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year. The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34 in USD, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89 in USD. At quarter end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last 4 quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%, and free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to see cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity. To that point, we now have 66 customer-facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world and another 6 being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure. We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, 9 national security regions and 2 EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we have 7 Alloy cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. And of course, we also have so many, many, many Cloud at Customer installations. The sizing and flexibility -- the sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantageous for us in the marketplace. And finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. And in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different. So because of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Total revenues, excluding Cerner, are expected to grow from 8% to 10%. Total cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 26% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Thank you, Safra. The demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and generative AI is consistently increasing quarter after quarter. Oracle's total remaining performance obligations, or RPO, has now reached $65 billion, slightly more than our annual revenue. In response to the sharply increasing demand, Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud data centers and building 100 new cloud data centers. We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply. Cloud infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate. In the next few weeks, we expect to sign a couple more billion-dollar cloud infrastructure contracts. Gartner recently named Oracle OCI as a leader in cloud platform and infrastructure services. The demand for cloud infrastructure services and new Oracle Cloud data centers is broad-based, driven not only by generative AI customers but also by nation states buying software and Oracle cloud data centers, plus large banks, telecommunications companies, and industrial companies buying dedicated cloud data centers, dedicated Oracle Cloud data centers. And perhaps most interestingly, demand from other hyperscalers and other cloud service providers co-locating and connecting their clouds with Oracle Cloud data centers. Customers don't want clouds to be walled gardens. In the next few months, we will turn on 20 new Oracle Cloud data centers co-located with and connected to Microsoft Azure as a part of our joint multi-cloud initiative. These 20 new multi-cloud data centers will house over 2,000 full racks of Exadata database machines designed to meet pent-up demand for the Oracle Cloud database. We are able to build new data centers rapidly and operate them inexpensively because all of our data centers are architecturally identical, highly automated with an identical high-performance RDMA network, autonomous services and applications. Oracle Cloud data centers vary only by scale. Again, several nation states have ordered multiple sovereign data centers to be built within their country so that they can move their government, health care and commercial workloads to the Oracle Cloud. These new countries include Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and others. Some of the world's largest banks, telecommunications and industrial companies have also contracted with us to build Oracle Cloud data centers dedicated entirely to them so that they can migrate their workloads to an Oracle Cloud data center. These companies include Nomura, Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile, Saudi Telecom, a huge Korean conglomerate and a huge U.S. defense contractor. These are but a few examples that demonstrate the diversity of the growing demand for Oracle's highly differentiated Gen2 cloud infrastructure and data center technology. Back to you, Ken."", 'Ken Bond', 'Thank you, Larry. Emma, if we could please poll the audience for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question today comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.', 'Benjamin Alexander Reitzes', ""It's great to be speaking with you this afternoon. Do you mind going through your thoughts on the OCI trajectory from here and how you feel backlog will play out into revenue? And perhaps you can comment also, is the acceleration potential that you guided for due to getting more GPUs and more AI backlog moving into revenue?"", 'Safra Ada Catz', 'Larry, you want me to take it or you?', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', 'No. Either one, Safra, you tell me.', 'Safra Ada Catz', ""How would I get started? So where do we expect OCI to go from here? Frankly, the only limiting factor is our ability to get the data centers, hand it over and filled up fast enough. This quarter alone, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that we would have been able to recognize if our capacity was available. So the reality is, as we roll out and we've got just so many moving parts, as you can hear from us, we have a lot of capacity coming online.And as you can see in my CapEx guidance, we expect OCI to just grow astronomically, frankly. It is the ideal infrastructure for so much use and, of course, also as more GPUs become available and we can put those in, we have just a really unlimited amount of demand. Larry, I don't know if you want to say anything else?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes. Well, again, in the next few weeks, I mentioned we're going to sign 2 additional contracts right around $1 billion each. I mean, the backlog is growing astronomically. I think it's the word Safra used and that's accurate. There's no reason why -- OCI grew 50% this quarter. I think OCI is going to get much bigger and actually, the growth rate will be above 50%, I believe, as these data centers come online.We think we can build a lot of these data centers very quickly. By the way, again, I emphasize it's not just gen AI demand. There's huge pent up data -- of Cloud database demand. There is huge demand overseas for sovereign clouds where people -- governments haven't been able to move their workloads and a lot of those are government Oracle workloads. They haven't been able to move their workloads to the cloud. I mean, there are literally, I don't know, 5, 6, 7 large companies in Japan that will be building at least 2 data centers, Oracle data centers each. So again, the demand is extraordinary. We can build the data centers relatively fast, and I expect the OCI growth rate to be over 50% for a few years."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes, we're not demand-limited in any way right now."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim.', 'John Stephen DiFucci', ""So since Ben asked about the growth, and maybe I'll take a step back on the other part of all this and that's the profit side, per Larry's comments, you're building out a lot of capacity and Safra's comments with the CapEx growth. But Clay has also spoken about the time it takes to build out hose AI super clusters, and I know that's not the only AI workloads you're doing, but that sounds like some pretty exciting stuff.And it takes time before you get revenue. I realize you're also seeing ramp-up of those, what I'll call, core OCI deals like Uber, and you actually get revenue from them over time. But how should we think about cloud gross margins over time in this context with both those things? A lot happening here."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes, and I'm really glad you asked. I'm really glad you asked because one of the lines that we show you, even though I'd give you more detail is, I show you a number that is a mix of Cloud and Support. And obviously, Support is extremely profitable because of the structure of the way it works and because we are at such a large scale.But the reality is that our cloud businesses are also very profitable. Our SaaS cloud business is very profitable. And our IaaS, our OCI business is improving profitability as it grows. And so the target gross margins for it are much higher than I think you expect because you're probably comparing it to some of the more pure-play cloud folks who somehow don't end up making as much money in all of this. As we grow, our gross margin percentage goes up.So yes, we make a lot of investments and we'll be making a lot of investments, but our profitability continues to go up because once the worst moment is at the moment where the data center is full of computers and you don't have any tenants that first day, but that's not actually how we work. Yes, we have the floor space but we grow in pieces, unlike some of the others that they have to do a full-out build out and put everything there before they have a penny of revenue. That's not how we work.And more and more of our -- so we start small and build up, and that allows us to match our spending with the revenues much better. And that's because we have that engineering deployment flexibility that the first-generation folks don't have. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes, I do. I think 1 thing is very important. We're much more highly automated than the older data centers. So to give you an idea, Oracle Cloud, to run Oracle Cloud, we have to keep track of all of our customers, how much they're using. We have to have a variety of databases and applications that run the cloud. Those databases are all the autonomous databases. We have no labor associated with those databases. It's all completely automated.Our installations, when we bring up a new cloud, you plug it in and the process of bringing it up is largely automated. There aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to bring it up, and there are -- certainly aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to run it every day. We focus on autonomous services. Our Linux, our operating system, is fully autonomous. There's no labor associated with running it. There's certainly labor associated with building the software but not running the software. It doesn't cost us more to run 100 data centers than it cost us to run 10 in terms of data -- DBAs or people running Oracle Autonomous Linux.So we have a very different model than our old data centers or our competitors' data centers. We can run these things. We can bring them up relatively quickly, and we can run them very inexpensively and efficiently. One last thing about being autonomous, the fact that it's automated, there are far fewer errors and there are far fewer security vulnerabilities because the system is completely self-driving."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', 'If I might, Safra, go back to something you said. Is it fair to assume that OCI gross margins have consistently grown over time quarter to quarter?', 'Safra Ada Catz', 'Yes.', 'John Stephen DiFucci', 'Okay, and then...', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""It's grown a lot."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', ""Grown a lot, okay. And then finally, the -- what Larry just said about the database, Safra, I've heard you say at times, we're at the beginning of the beginning of the transition of the database to cloud. So I know you have database in the cloud today but that migration of the on-prem, that's still to come pretty much?"", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes, it is really still to come. It is -- we're talking about tens of billions of dollars when it comes over. So we -- it's starting to come but we haven't been in the place to receive it all en masse. And customers have to get comfortable with it, and also multi-cloud has to really roll out and that's going to be another piece of it. So customers are going to have so many excellent choices. They can go in the public cloud, they can go in OCI. They can go in their cloud customer. They can go in OCI at Azure is 1 possibility.So there's just -- it is the absolute beginning because remember, the Oracle database is not a toy. It's a mission-critical system. If it just disappeared at companies, the whole planet would come to a standstill. And so this is coming and it's just the beginning. So you see what's going on with OCI. No one believed us this was possible. Now here we're at and then right behind it is going to come the database. And that's going to be something."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', ""And for Larry's comments, and I'll stop talking, but for Larry's comments, the database gross margins, given the autonomous nature of it, we should expect that to be different than the OCI core infrastructure-as-a-service gross margin?"", 'Safra Ada Catz', 'Yes, absolutely.', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes, the autonomous -- I don't want to go into detail, but the autonomous database is one, autonomous. There's no labor associated with it. But it's also the only database that's fully elastic. In other words, if you're not using it, no one's using it. I mean, there are no cores, there's no cores occupied. It goes back into the pool. So if you as a customer aren't doing something with the database, literally no cores are occupied. It's very different than an Amazon database where you allocate.I always need 64 cores or 64 processors to run my database, and that's 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. We only charge you for what you use when you're using it. We only consume and -- what you use when you're using it. Otherwise, it goes to other customers. It's totally different. That allows us to have dramatically higher gross margins."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', 'Sorry for the several-part question, but thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.', 'Mark L. Moerdler', ""I want to change gears a little bit and turn to Cerner, which people don't really focus on that much. Cerner license revenue has been down likely in preparation for customers shifting to SaaS. But Oracle doesn't yet have a full multitenant, scalable Cerner SaaS solution. So what I'd like to ask is a couple of parts. How should we think about the timing of, one, the availability of -- yes?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""That's not correct, so Cerner has several pieces. And I believe about half of the customers will be moved -- half of the Millennium customers. You can think of Cerner as just automating hospitals like Epic. And that's a product called Millennium, and about half of those customers will move to OCI by February. Half of all existing customers will be in Oracle OCI.But we've also developed something that began at Cerner and we have finished. Now we completely rewritten it -- well, we're in the process, we will finish next calendar year. But it is largely rewritten and available right now, something called our Health and Data Intelligence Platform. And it was known as Cerner as HealtheIntent and that's for public health. That's for population-scale, public health management. Again, if it's sold to U.S. states. It's sold to Australian states. It's sold to European countries. It's for managing population health.Remember during COVID, when we didn't know New York thought they were running out of hospital rooms but they really weren't but no one knew because no one kept track of our inventory of hospital rooms. There's no national view. No one knew how many people contracted COVID yesterday. We didn't have that national view. We have that national view. It is fully SaaS and it is available right now. So some of the pieces -- some of the Cerner pieces are coming online. Other Cerner pieces are moving more gradually, but they're all going into OCI, and they're all very quickly moving from a license basis to a subscription basis."", 'Mark L. Moerdler', ""So that's very helpful. So that starts to answer the question I was asking was how should we think about the timing of the transition? Millennium, you're saying, is going to be in OCI. Is that going to be a fully SaaS version? When will the rest of the solutions be fully SaaS? And how should we think about the revenue lift as the license and maintenance moves to the cloud -- to SaaS?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""So it will be fully in OCI and SaaS but it will not be the new -- we are rewriting -- we're replacing Millennium a piece at a time, not a big lift in shift, but we are upgrading and modernizing Millennium a piece at a time and different pieces will be available starting next year. And so Cerner customers will be getting new features and capabilities as a part of a Millennium -- as Millennium moves to OCI. And again, half the customers will be in OCI by February.So we're making a lot of progress. At the same time, we're adding a lot of new products to Millennium, like the public health products. But we're also adding much of new products for pharmaceutical companies. We're adding additional products for hospitals to keep track of their inventory, for hospitals to manage their workforce. Really, what we think of as our health division in Oracle has products for the entire health care ecosystems, payers, including governments, including insurance companies, providers, including ambulatory clinics and hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, research companies and public health departments, national governments and state governments.So we are -- we have products for the entire health care ecosystem which is a much larger footprint than Cerner ever had. So we are going after a much larger market than Cerner was. So we expect Cerner to be a growth story, I guess that's what I'm getting at."", 'Mark L. Moerdler', ""Great. That's where I'm going with the question."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes. So let me just tell you, I think for the year -- for the full fiscal year, Cerner will be sort of negative 1 to 2 points but that will be it. It will end this fiscal year. And from then on, it will be a growth story. So it will no longer be a drag on Oracle's growth, okay?"", 'Mark L. Moerdler', 'Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. That was very helpful.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.', 'Sitikantha Panigrahi', 'Larry and Safra, many mission-critical workloads still run an Oracle database and you have a sticky maintenance revenue stream. And we expect Oracle will start migrating those database workloads to OCI, which will bring 3x revenue uplift, which you call in the third leg of cloud growth. You also have now OCI inside Azure data center.So my question is, how does this being multi-cloud change your outlook for Oracle database? And what are you hearing from your database customer in terms of their comfort and preparedness to move their Oracle databases to the cloud, either OCI or Azure?', 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Larry, why don't you start with this? No, yes, I do. You go."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Okay. Our customers are very happy with the idea. Remember, Oracle started as one of the first databases that ran everywhere. We ran on IBM mainframes. We ran on personal computers. We ran on digital equipment, if you remember them, many computers. And HP mini computers. We ran on every operating system on every computer.Now in cloud, they're very happy to see that they can not only get the Oracle database at OCI, they can also get the identical capability from Microsoft. Microsoft, we are building data centers for Microsoft inside Azure. And Microsoft, it wasn't us that decided 2,000 was the right number of Exadata machines to install in those 20 data centers. That was Microsoft. The demand is enormous. They want the same -- plus our customers want the same flexibility they've always had with Oracle. They want to use Oracle, they want to transition. But if they're using the Microsoft cloud, they want to run the best and latest and greatest version of Oracle in the Microsoft Cloud.They want to do that in other clouds as well. Some of them is very important to have it. In Japan, for example, it's very important for some of that data remaining in Japan. One of the things the Oracle database does is it runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And it does that in a dedicated data center run by Nomura Research who supplies financial services and Oracle Cloud, Oracle Gen2 Cloud Services to the Japanese market. There are a number of other partners in Japan that are going in that same direction.So they used to -- in Japan, they used to buy the Oracle database from Nomura or they used to buy it from Fujitsu or they bought it from Hitachi or they bought it from NEC. They wanted that Oracle database. It is quite natural for all of those companies to build their own -- have their own dedicated regions of OCI and sell to their -- and support their customers out of those regions. That's the flexibility we allow that something that nobody else can do. We can build these regions for our partners. We can build these regions for sovereign states. We can build these regions for large companies that want to have -- that don't want their data commingled with anyone else's.They want a public cloud. They want a full OCI. They want every part of OCI, but they don't want anyone else in that -- in their region. They want it to be theirs and theirs alone. We can do that. Nobody else can."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line...', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Let me summarize. That means literally any way you want to get Oracle, any way you want to get Oracle, you will be able to get it. It will be a little bit back to the future. And we think the impact on demand -- on database demand, we're seeing it already. Let me close with 2,000 Exadata reps. That's a stunning number in terms of how many customers you could put on that. That's tens of thousands of customers you can put on that much hardware. And that's Microsoft alone, okay."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.', 'Aleksandr J. Zukin', ""I wanted to ask around some of the gen AI functionality inside of the applications portfolio, specifically Fusion and NetSuite. Any update or uptick that you're seeing or can share around some of your partnerships around Cohere? Maybe any early feedback from the field that informs incremental value capture, whether or not it's starting to resonate either in the form of increased migration activity, increased market share gains or increased monetization opportunities around the application portfolio."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes. Well, we're using it every place. Perhaps the most stunning is our new -- again, I mentioned at Cerner earlier that we're doing a lot of things that Cerner never did in what is now called Oracle Health. One of those things is our new telecommunications module summarizes a consultation between a doctor and a patient and writes the doctor's notes for the doctor automatically. In fact, for the first time, we've done it. We now have our large language model generating the summary without a scribe, but the doctor can edit in a couple of minutes. So it's actually succeeded in doing one of the very hardest tasks we assigned it.And of course, we're using it in everything from as simple as doing product descriptions or job descriptions, all of those, you've read about all of those. We've actually got those implemented, are delivering those to customers. But even in some of the most challenging areas, in drug design. We're having success with pharmaceutical companies. But with -- actually writing the doctor's notes without a scribe has shocked a great many people. And well, another area, in terms of diagnosing cancer from biopsy, just biopsy images, being able to do that very, very quickly where the patient knows weeks sooner than they would otherwise -- that they get the news weeks sooner from the -- just maybe AI processing the biopsy image, they find out weeks sooner or whether they have to go on chemotherapy or whether they're cancer-free.And we're doing that with an Israeli partner called Imagene. So no, we're seeing a huge uptake of this technology, everything from complex health care and health science to more mundane tasks that you find throughout an enterprise that's still very important in making your employees and your company more efficient and more competitive."", 'Aleksandr J. Zukin', 'Got it. And then from a monetization standpoint, do you -- is this monetizing in a Copilot way similar to Microsoft? Or how do you envision ultimately seeing some of the incremental value captured inside of the model?', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Well, we think inside of our -- we're -- remember, we're a little bit different than Microsoft. We have a lot more enterprise applications, for example, in health care in -- we run clinical trials. We run hospitals. We run the ambulatory clinics. We run -- we have diagnostic databases for image [costing] databases, conventional blood testing databases, all of those. So our monetization is really at the highest end of the value chain, which is we actually supply the application with our partner that does cancer diagnosis, that does the doctor's notes, that does the doctor's orders, that actually automatically generates the prescriptions, that reminds the patient to take the subscription so you get compliance.Right now without -- I don't want -- I can't spend too much on it. Right now, doctors don't know if patients have refilled their prescriptions. The doctors aren't notified and the patients aren't notified. Reminding them. We're doing all of that. We're doing a bunch of things with -- and that's the high value end of AI, when you're preventing someone from being rehospitalized, which has a huge cost in terms of human suffering and money."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Now we have multiple ways, by the way, to monetize it not only as part of our application but also as part of our infrastructure because one of the unique capabilities we allow is for customers, when they use our product, to basically use their private data in some of these models to -- for them to learn but then to ultimately keep control of their data. And this is applicable in many, many different types of applications and this is a service we provide in addition. So there's just a lot..."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Safra's making a very good point in that we have our own applications in health care, but we have partners and other companies that come to us to use our AI to enrich their applications. And we keep their data private and allow them to enrich their applications. That company I mentioned earlier, Imagene, that's not our application that does the cancer diagnosis. That's an Israeli company that's doing that, but they're using our AI to develop their health care application. So in the -- and their -- so we monetize through Imagene, enabling them to build their AI application, and we also build a lot of our own. So of course, Safra is right. It's a combination of the 2."", 'Operator', 'Your last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.', 'Brad Alan Zelnick', ""Larry, it's taken Oracle several years to reach 66 cloud data centers, and you're now talking about plans to build 100 new ones, which frankly seems very ambitious. What is it that you're seeing that maybe we don't see? And then related perhaps, Safra, if you can speak to the capital requirements and time frame for that, especially in light of CapEx this quarter that was a bit less than we had expected."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Well, okay. How about Microsoft puts an order for 20 -- in an order for 20 cloud data centers? That's what we're seeing. When 1 company -- as you say, we have 60. By the way, that's a little bit -- that's not quite right. I mean, we have 66 cloud regions and we sometimes use those synonymously. They're not always -- they don't -- a data center and region don't necessarily translate 1:1.But the -- yes, when someone comes along and orders 20, then that creates a lot of opportunity for us to build more data centers and get more OCI customers because we're building OCI data centers inside of Azure Cloud. So those are the things we're seeing. We're building our own public regions based on direct customer demand. And then we're building partner regions like the 20 data centers from Microsoft. The combination of the 2 adds up to 100."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes. And also, one of the things is in that number, it doesn't include the many, many Cloud at Customers which started small and now companies have decided they want their own region. So they had a Cloud at Customer, which is smaller and they decided, no, no, no. Now I want a dedicated region of my own. I get it. This is working. I've saved millions, tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions. Now I want my own.Also, really the -- it is absolutely true. We did not bring up as much capacity as we could have used this past quarter because we had to make some audible calls on the field to decide how to allocate whether to build something small, which was available, which I could have recognized revenue in right in the quarter, or instead to go much bigger and to wait until some larger capacity was going to be available to hand over to me.So as I think I've hinted and we're talking about demand, had we had capacity this quarter in the hundreds of millions of dollars more that was just sitting there waiting to take it, and we have made some deployment choices because we need more and we need it bigger. Instead of taking small pieces or smaller pieces, we decided to focus on the bigger parts and tried to also treat our customers fairly and work with them to meet their needs."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Let me give you 1 example of that, what Safra is describing is we got enough NVIDIA GPUs for Elon Musk's company, xAI, to bring up the first version, the first available version of their large language model called Grok. They got that up and running. But boy, did they want a lot more. Boy, did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them. We gave them quite a few but they wanted more, and we are in the process of getting them more.So the demand, we got that up pretty quickly. They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more as there's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model. And we are doing our best to keep -- give our customers what we can this quarter and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter."", 'Ken Bond', ""Okay.

We lowered our appraisal as our outlook for the company deteriorated, leading to a full exit in the quarter. Lumen represented a permanent capital loss for the Fund, a significant opportunity cost for the portfolio and a disappointing long-term mistake. Lumen has reinforced the importance of limiting overweight positions in the portfolio, being cautious of leverage and value declines, and fully re-underwriting a case – and being willing to move on – when the people and/or underlying facts change.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24', 'Online ads company Taboola.com Limited (NASDAQ:TBLA) shares have gained about 16% year to date through December 9.

Operating during heightened inflation adds another challenge to the sector. Retail Dive took a look at companies that have had a tumultuous or tenuous year, those that need a turnaround – or are in the midst of one – or retailers that have seen substantial C-suite turnover.', 'In some instances, companies experienced all of the above. And they could really use an end-of-year win. Here, in no particular order, is our qualitative roundup of five retailers that might be at risk next year if they don’t achieve a strong operational and financial finish this holiday season.', 'Throughout the year, Joann’s financial performance hasn’t been exceptionally strong.', 'In December last year, Joann recorded a loss and suspended its dividend payments to improve liquidity. At the same time, the retailer said it had crafted a $200 million cost reduction plan that it hopes to realize by 2025. About half of those savings are expected to come from lower supply chain costs. In March, the company said it borrowed the full $100 million\xa0available under a first-in, last-out facility. It used the FILO loan and cash on hand to repay some of its borrowings under an asset-based revolving loan.', 'Joann had about $1.1 billion in long-term debt\xa0at the end of Q3. The company faced a delisting notice\xa0from the Nasdaq as its stock was trading below $1 at the time this story was published.', 'In May, President and CEO Wade Miquelon retired. In September, the company restructured and laid off an undisclosed number of people. In its most recent earnings, Joann’s top-line sales gained post-Black Friday momentum. The company also raised its previously stated cost savings goal to $225 million.\xa0“But one seasonal push may not necessarily be enough to save the retailer that has been cash-strapped for some time and suffocating under the weight of its debt,” Creditsafe spokesperson Ragini Bhalla said.', 'In December, Joann reported net sales declined by 4.1% from last year to $539.8 million. Total comps sales fell 4.1%, while e-commerce sales rose at a rate of 11.5% compared to last year, accounting for 13.1% of total company net sales.', 'Express debuted 43 years ago in a different era of retail and apparel. But as the worst of the pandemic waned, so too did interest in the company’s main offering. Business casual was out and athleisure was in. Along the way, experts and analysts told Retail Dive earlier this year that Express lost brand awareness.', 'Last December, Express announced an intellectual property joint venture with brand management firm WHP Global. However, the company’s poor financial performance has persisted. In Q1, the company’s net sales fell 15% to $383 million from $451 million a year ago. Comp sales for the quarter also fell 14%, and the company posted a quarterly loss of $73.4 million, a sharp year-over-year rise. On the news that sales fell 6.4% in Q2 to $435.3 million, the retailer also announced cost-cutting and borrowing initiatives, which included slashing jobs. Third-quarter results were better, with net sales rising 5% to $454.1 million, up from $434.1 million a year ago, thanks to the acquisition of Bonobos from Walmart. E-commerce also rose 10%.', 'Express planned to cut 150 jobs during Q3. The move was part of plans to reduce annual expenses by $200 million by 2025. The retailer this year also saw noteworthy leadership turnover.', 'Chief Operating Officer Matthew Moellering retired in May and Chief Merchandising Officer Malissa Akay exited in July. In September, CEO Tim Baxter resigned; Stewart Glendinning replaced him. And the following month, CFO Jason Judd left.\xa0The retailer also completed a reverse stock split.', 'The company during the third quarter said it plans to pursue an international brand expansion. Recently appointed CEO Glendinning acknowledged during the Q3 earnings call that Express made some past merchandising missteps. They included a women’s offering that was out of balance across categories and price points. Looking forward, “each one of the parts of our business” will play a role in Express’ turnaround, Glendinning said during the call.', 'The parent company of QVC and HSN began the year by laying off 400 people. The move generated $60 million in savings. In Q2, Qurate Retail Group sold its Zulily e-commerce unit to an investment firm. Under that deal, Qurate repaid Zulily’s $80 million in outstanding debt. That move was meant to optimize the company’s brand portfolio.', 'During Q3, Qurate’s retail revenue fell 3% to $2.5 billion (excluding Zulily). On the upside, the company did lower its line of credit debt balance by $435 million using operating cash flow and insurance proceeds paid following a deadly fire at a now-closed distribution center in North Carolina.', 'CEO David Rawlinson said during the company’s most recent earnings call that Qurate is focused on managing inventory and lowering supply chain and operating costs as part of efforts to improve performance. “Going into Q4, we are cognizant of the challenges from inflation, interest rates and geopolitical events,” Rawlinson said, according to a call transcript. “We remain steadfast in our transformation.”', 'Walgreens experienced a roller coaster year when it came to finances and operations.', 'The company’s growing U.S. healthcare segment boosted financial performance, driving the business to $34.9 billion in Q2 sales. But the company missed analysts’ earnings expectations for Q3, achieving $35.4 billion in sales.\xa0In May, the company said it planned to lay off 500 workers in a bid to focus less on retail and more on its healthcare operations.', 'Walgreens lowered its full-year outlook in June. That same month, the company said it planned to close 150 U.S. stores and 300 locations in the U.K. The closures were part of a cost-cutting effort that has repeatedly seen its target number increase. With that round of closures, the company projected $800 million in savings in 2024, for an accumulation of $4.1 billion. Then again in November, Walgreens confirmed it planned to lay off 5% of its corporate workforce.', 'The retail pharmacy company also saw noteworthy turnover in its C-suite this year. Former CFO James Kehoe resigned in July; Manmohan Mahajan was named interim CFO. CEO Rosalind Brewer left in September. The company named Tim Wentworth to replace Brewer. Chief Information Officer Hsiao Wang left in October after a year at Walgreens. Then in November, Chief Medical Officer Kevin Ban stepped down, effective immediately. It remains unclear how the new leaders may move to reshape Walgreens as it continues to navigate various challenges.', 'Kohl’s began the year with the layoff of about 60 at its corporate headquarters. The move followed a sales slowdown at the end of last year where revenue fell 7% to $4.3 billion. In Q1,\xa0net sales fell, and as the company moved into Q2, profits plunged\xa0and its performance slid again in Q3, with net sales falling 5.2% and comp sales falling 5.5% year over year.', ""A year ago, Kohl’s moved to add Sephora store-in-stores to all locations. Kohl’s thinks the move can add $2 billion in sales by 2025. “We continue to be extremely happy with our partnership with Sephora and with the results that we are achieving. Based on our success, we have increased confidence that Sephora at Kohl's will be a $2 billion business by 2025,” CEO Tom Kingsbury said during the latest earnings call, according to a transcript."", 'Also during the call in November, Kingsbury acknowledged weakness in the retailer’s e-commerce segment. Kingsbury said Kohl’s “digital business is really what’s bringing us down.” The retailer’s digital sales declined 16.5% in the third quarter. In response, Kingsbury said the company moved to establish its stores as a key brand focal point this year. That comes as President and COO Dave Alves left the company in November after less than a year in the role.', ""The retailer is also heavily apparel-focused. Going forward, Kingsbury said Kohl’s is looking to “de-weather” its business to grow sales in less weather-sensitive categories like beauty and home. “We're obviously repositioning the company, and we're building in all these initiatives that are really just getting started,” CFO Jill Timm said during the last earnings call in response to an analyst’s question on how the company expects a range of new initiatives to perform."", 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

We review activity of the previous day's grants, then connect with the grant review committee to make sure they're able to make decisions on new grants or applications that came in the day before.

Sometimes it's not everybody every day, but it is everybody every week."", 'Creative expression', ""Coming out of the pandemic, it felt like we were all wearing a lot of stress. Finding something that's a release, that brings me joy and makes me feel truly like myself has been important. For me, that expression comes through music.

She was a wildly talented pianist who made music a very important part of my life."", 'After moving to Washington, I aggravated an old sports injury and ended up needing spinal surgery.

Nonetheless, some investors are quite optimistic about prospects for this chain of drive-thru coffee shops. In fact, its latest financial results beat Wall Street estimates, breathing some life into the struggling shares that are currently down 64% from their peak.', ""Better days could be ahead. Can this coffee stock -- currently priced at about $27 a share -- hit $50 by the end of 2024? Here's what investors need to know when thinking about what would equate to an 80% gain from today's price."", ""The reason this business is on the radar is due to its rapid store expansion. A year ago, there were 641 locations in the U.S., a figure that has jumped to 794 now. The leadership team is optimistic that one day, there will be 4,000 open. This is a truly lofty target. And investors are hoping that executives don't let up on the gas pedal. "", 'While more locations helped overall company revenue soar 33% in the latest quarter, one area that really needs to show signs of improvement, in my opinion, is same-store sales (or comps).', ""On a systemwide basis, comps were up by 4% in the third quarter. To be fair, this is a huge improvement from negative growth in the first quarter. But it's nothing to write home about yet. If we look at only company-owned stores, the picture is even worse as comps for these locations increased by just 2.8% in the third quarter."", ""I'm sure that shareholders and the management team believe that when the economic backdrop improves, and inflation continues easing, these metrics will accelerate their gains."", 'There are reasons to temper expectations, though. The restaurant industry, and the market for coffee houses in particular, is probably one of the most competitive there is. There are almost zero barriers to entry for new rivals looking to establish a presence.', ""And in Dutch Bros' case, as it continues expanding, it will inevitably compete more directly with the likes of Starbucks, the undisputed leader in the industry with 16,300 stores scattered across the U.S. Starbucks has a proven business model, better profitability, scale advantages, and a powerful brand. Its dominance will only make things more difficult for Dutch Bros."", ""Consensus analyst estimates call for Dutch Bros to post 26% revenue growth and a 51% increase in earnings per share in 2024 compared to 2023. Even if these projections come to fruition, I don't think they are enough to propel the stock 80% higher to $50 per share."", 'Dutch Bros will certainly need its valuation multiple to expand considerably. As of this writing, the stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.7. Historically, shares have averaged a P/S multiple of 3.1, so things have definitely been under pressure lately as investors seem to have lost their enthusiasm.', ""For comparison's sake, Starbucks trades at a P/S ratio of 3.1 right now. On the one hand, you can argue that because of its long track record of financial success and strong brand recognition, this valuation is warranted."", ""However, this might be a signal that Dutch Bros' shares are indeed undervalued. While that could be an accurate assumption, betting on a stock's multiple to rise significantly in the next 12 months is not a prudent way to invest. This is totally unpredictable, and it's fully based on investor sentiment."", ""I think it's safe to assume that Dutch Bros shares will not reach $50 in 2024.

If you can step into a compelling stock prospect at a lower price, though, why wouldn't you?"", ""With that as the backdrop, risk-tolerant investors looking for a bargain-priced growth name may want to scoop up some shares of coffee outfit Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) while they're still down 66% from their late-2021 peak. Its expansion plans are percolating, which could make its stock piping hot in the coming year."", ""It's not exactly a household name ... at least not yet. The company operates only around 800 drive-thru coffee stands, mostly along the West Coast and in the Southwestern United States. For perspective, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) boasts more than 36,000 stores worldwide, with more than 16,000 located in the United States alone. If Dutch Bros is going to make a dent in a market dominated by Starbucks, it will need to do and be something distinctly different."", ""The thing is, Dutch Bros is distinctly different. In addition to operating strictly as a drive-thru service (rather than managing sit-down destinations like Starbucks), Dutch Bros' casual, less-polished, more neighborhoody atmosphere has its clear charm. It's neither unusual for a local stand to participate in a neighborhood fundraiser, for instance, nor for Dutch Bros employees to help raise money for fellow workers in need."", 'Its menu is different, too. Although it still serves the requisite coffee in all its key forms, smoothies, energy drinks, iced beverages, and shakes are additional options for in-car customers often in a hurry to get somewhere else. Dutch Bros even offers kid-friendly options.', ""Together, it all looks more like what consumers increasingly want -- affordable, healthy, flavorful treats served up in a jiffy. Its customers also appreciate how civic-minded the company's culture is."", ""And the numbers say as much. Last quarter's same-store sales growth of 4% may be merely so-so. Just bear in mind that it's still comparing its results to sales that soared during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. There's still enough business to be won to report companywide revenue growth of 33% (year over year) last quarter, thanks to the addition of 39 new stores. That brings the count to 794 stores, en route to a goal of 1,000 locales by early 2025."", ""However, the company's longer-term goal should truly excite interested investors. Dutch Bros is laying the groundwork for what will eventually be a chain of 4,000 locations. Given that it's found a winning formula for gaining and retaining customers, it's difficult to doubt the coffee company will get there soon enough."", 'The kicker: Incoming CEO Christine Barone is a former Starbucks executive. She obviously knows a thing or two about the business.', 'Investors keeping tabs on Dutch Bros likely already know fast food giant McDonald\'s (NYSE: MCD) just unveiled a new restaurant brand that could prove problematic for Dutch Bros\' plans. Specifically, McDonald\'s is testing the waters of a ""beverage-led concept"" called CosMc\'s that\'s ""rooted in beverage exploration, with bold and unexpected flavor combinations, vibrant colors and functional boosts.""', ""It's a bit of a stretch to say McDonald's completely ripped off Dutch Bros' menu full of chilled and frozen drinks or coffee-based treats. Dutch Bros didn't exactly invent the goods it sells either. It's also a stretch to suggest CosMc's will truly be a threat to Dutch Bros anytime soon, if ever. After all, only one such store is up and running right now, with only about 10 more to be established by the end of 2024."", 'It would be short-sighted, however, to not also point out the stark parallels between the two brands. In addition to the menu itself, ""CosMc\'s blazes its own path with a uniquely seamless digital and drive-thru experience"" so customers can ""breeze through the ordering and payment process."" It seems eerily familiar.', ""Still, it's not a problem simply because McDonald's Corp. will likely struggle to replicate the human touch that Dutch Bros' drive-thru stands are known for."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""See, McDonald's deliberately designs stores and establishes training standards so consumers' dining experiences at any of its restaurants are more or less the same; it probably intends to do the same with CosMc's. That's not necessarily what consumers want, though. Again, its customers like that Dutch Bros' stores each seem to have their own personality."", ""Moreover, the fact that McDonald's is entering this new territory may actually be a bullish sign for Dutch Bros. Think about it."", ""McDonald's has mastered the art and science of selling fast food. Even if CosMc's is more of an experiment than a growth initiative at this point, that it's spending time and money to conduct an experiment in the customized and premium beverage space speaks volumes about the market opportunity it sees on this front."", 'And it\'s not the only name making such a move on this quickly developing sliver of the drive-thru market. Smaller outfits, like Scooter\'s, Jamba, Swig, Ellianos, and 7 Brew, are just some of the other players looking to capitalize on the fast-growing demand for quality beverages sold via drive-thrus. Even Starbucks is responding after three-fourths of its third-quarter sales came from its cold-drink category, prompting the rollout of cold foam blenders, ""one of the fastest rollouts [of new equipment] in our history.""', ""Dutch Bros, however, is arguably the only such player with the size, strength, skill, and culture to fully capitalize on this category's growth."", ""While its backstory and potential upside are tasty, Dutch Bros still isn't the right pick for everyone's portfolio. Though profitable, it's a young company and is shelling out quite a bit of cash on its expansion efforts. The stock's also relatively young, only issued via the company's public offering in September 2021. Shares may still be shrugging off the usual post-IPO (initial public offering) impact."", ""If you can deal with the likely volatility and keep your eyes on the longer-term prize, however, it wouldn't be crazy to take a shot on Dutch Bros while the stock's still down."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', 'The $16,728 Social Security Bonus You Cannot Afford to Miss', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'James Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.', 'Pricing Power: Players in the tobacco industry have been leveraging the strong pricing influence of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and soft cigarette sales volumes. Since smokers tend to be less responsive to price hikes due to their addiction, this approach is anticipated to continue benefiting companies within the tobacco sector. Prudent pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues of players in the tobacco industry in the face of declining volumes.', 'Smoke-Free Products Gain Prominence: Rising health consciousness and stringent government regulations aimed at reducing cigarette smoking have driven many consumers toward reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives.

Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. As cigarette sales constitute a significant portion of revenue for tobacco industry companies, the decrease in sales volumes within this category raises concerns.', 'Inflationary Cost Pressures: The performance of numerous industry participants has been adversely affected by cost inflation.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Packaging Corporation of America's shares before the 15th of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of January."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Packaging Corporation of America has a trailing yield of 3.0% on the current stock price of $165.2. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Packaging Corporation of America has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Packaging Corporation of America paid out 57% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (55%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.', ""It's positive to see that Packaging Corporation of America's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Packaging Corporation of America earnings per share are up 4.4% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Packaging Corporation of America has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is Packaging Corporation of America an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive.

I mean, some of the longer-standing deal, deals that people talked about with Viacom and the Paramount Global haven't happened. And then people have been really taken aback by certain surprises."", ""So I think there is an imperative to get more consolidation. I think there's probably some residual antitrust concern, even though it may not be rational for certain businesses. I mean, you may recall that theater deals were very difficult for a number of years because of a Supreme Court ruling going back to 1954. And I think you could probably have a little bit of resistance in Washington to combining broadcast networks and particularly if you combine news operation. You can see what's happening in the UK right now with The Telegraph and Jeff Zucker and potentially Abu Dhabi being supposedly a passive potential investor in concert with Zucker. So I think people are talking certainly. But talking is very-- it's very difficult to satisfy all parties when you look at the valuations right now in traditional media.""]"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:', 'CRISPR Therapeutics just made history on Friday with the first FDA-approved gene-editing medicine based on the Nobel Prize-winning discovery that targets disease with the billion-year old defense mechanism bacteria use to battle viruses.', 'CRISPR -- which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -- was discovered and described as a potential gene modifying treatment in a paper published in 2012 by biochemist Jennifer Doudna and microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier.', 'Their research collaboration, which began in 2011 when the two scientists met at a conference, set them on the trail of an ancient mystery they were both deeply interested in: how did some bacteria defeat invading viruses with such precision and consistency?', 'It turns out that bacteria could learn to ""edit"" the DNA of viruses with a built-in ""molecular scalpel"" and permanently disable their ability to replicate within the host. Doudna and Charpentier found that bacteria were leaving detailed clues about this warfare technology through clustered and repeated sequences of genetic code.', 'In 2020, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of the CRISPR/Cas9 ""genetic scissors."" Cas is short for ""CRISPR-associated"" and used to designate the different enzymes involved with a particular gene.', ""In a special edition of Zacks Confidential tonight I'll be doing a deeper dive on the dynamic duo of CRISPR. And I'll also be discussing at least four other stocks that are the best ways to play the CRISPR revolution. Right now, let's look at the news and the numbers that sparked an 80%+ rally in CRSP shares in November."", ""I have been an investor in CRISPR stocks since 2017 when I launched my Healthcare Innovators portfolio service. And to say it's been a bumpy road -- for both the R&D and the stocks -- would be putting it lightly. (That's to say nothing of the legal and patent battles over the science which are sure to come back around.)"", ""Gene editing is scary to many people, and word of rogue experiments in China didn't help its public reputation for the approval of clinical trials. I recall holding shares of Editas Medicine for round-trips between $20 and $90 -- twice!"", 'I tried to hang on through the ups and the downs, believing the bigger medical breakthroughs and inevitable stock breakout would come (with fingers crossed). Alas, as investors we instead entered a long ""CRISPR winter.""', 'The great news is that the dedicated R&D work of scientists and medical professionals stayed warm and fruitful during these years. And thankfully I was buying both EDIT and CRSP near their lows in 2023.', 'CRSP is currently a Zacks #2 Rank Buy as EPS estimates have climbed over 30% in the past two months because over a dozen covering analysts raised the consensus loss for this year from -$4.83 to -$3.27.', 'I now expect estimates for next year to also rise significantly after this historic approval, and push the stock into the upper deck of the Zacks Rank.', 'So what made the FDA launch this landmark leap for gene-editing and bring such a controversial science to the medical marketplace?', 'First, on October 31, an FDA Advisory Committee panel met to discuss the risks and benefits of the investigational treatment ""exa-cel"" (exagamglogene autotemcel) from CRISPR and its ""big brother"" partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals.', 'Exa-cel was designed and tested in clinical trials to treat two debilitating blood disorders, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.', 'The FDA challenge: One of the unique hurdles for CRISPR technologies is the potential for ""off-target"" edits of other genes that could be turned off, replaced, altered or eliminated. And this was one of the primary themes of the meeting of the Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies AdCom.', 'The FDA opportunity: An FDA green light would make exa-cel the first approved drug using CRISPR and could offer a permanent solution for patients with severe SCD, a genetic disorder where red blood cells morph into a collapsed ""sickle"" shape that makes it difficult for them to travel in the bloodstream.', 'From the NIH website on Sickle Cell Disease...', 'SCD is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders that affect hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the body. Normally, red blood cells are disc-shaped and flexible enough to move easily through the blood vessels. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells become crescent- or ""sickle""-shaped due to a genetic mutation. These sickled red blood cells do not bend or move easily and can block blood flow to the rest of the body.', 'Bottom line on FDA AdCom: The panel agreed that there were theoretical off-target edit risks for exa-cel, but overall it was unanimous that its efficacy benefit outweighs that risk. While this was not a formal FDA approval (just an Advisory Committee) the news was very encouraging and gave several Wall Street analysts, many of whom are either MDs or PhDs in the life sciences, greater confidence in an eventual FDA approval.', 'Following the Oct 31 AdCom, Truist analysts led by Dr. Joon Lee reiterated their $220 price target on CRSP shares as they envision strong physician support and sales for Casgevy (the commercial name for exa-cel) once it hits the market.', ""Then, on November 16 after a 2-week 50% rally in CRSP shares, the UK became the first national health regulator to approve Casgevy. Here's what I told investors in my Healthcare Innovators portfolio where we bought CRSP again in the $40s..."", 'CRISPR Goes Boom!', 'Healthcare Investor', 'Big News: The first CRISPR treatment has been approved!', ""We've been waiting a long time for this and the setbacks have been numerous. But this marks the early innings of what could become a very profitable field to invest in."", ""Vertex and CRISPR won UK conditional marketing authorization for their Casgevy gene therapy, marking the world's first approval of a drug using the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR."", 'The companies announced on Thursday that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (""MHRA"") of the United Kingdom has granted conditional marketing authorization to their CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy, Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel, or ""exa-cel"") for treating two debilitating blood disorders, sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT).', 'While the FDA had already set a decision date of December 8 for Casgevy in SCD, the Nov 16 approval from the UK put some added pressure on US regulators.', 'Then there is the pricing issue as these new gene therapies are expensive and require intense rounds of treatment. In Europe, insurance companies have resisted the need to pay for therapies costing over $1 million per patient.', ""And this proposed treatment is particularly complex as it involves extracting blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow, editing those cells in the lab ex vivo (outside the body), and then infusing them back into the patient's body. This ex vivo approach is considered less risky because it can avoid off-target edits to other genes. But this complex treatment regime also includes chemotherapy and patients must be hospitalized for a month or possibly longer."", 'On Friday after the FDA announcement, Vertex and CRISPR revealed the price tag for the Casgevy treatment in SCD: $2.2 million. The market reaction by CRSP investors, after a pre-FDA spike on Friday above $75 to 16-month highs, was a classic ""sell the news"" back down to the mid-$60s. But volume was enormous at 17 million shares and that told me buyers were coming in off the lows near $62.', ""More important than investor reaction right now, for me anyway, was the response of one Nobel laureate with a huge stake in the development of CRISPR science into actual medicines. In her 2017 book, A Crack In Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, she took a strong ethical stand on the power of technologies such as CRISPR to be misused. Here's what she had to say upon the FDA approval of Casgevy..."", '""Going from the lab to an approved CRISPR therapy in just 11 years is a truly remarkable achievement,"" Doudna said, adding she was especially pleased that the approval helps patients with ""a disease that has long been neglected by the medical establishment.""', 'Writing for Genetic Engineering & Technology News, Kevin Davies, PhD. shared this perspective...', 'It is ironic that the first approved CRISPR therapy -- a technology barely ten years old -- should be for the genetic disorder that Linus Pauling famously dubbed ""the first molecular disease"" almost 75 years ago.', ""Davies, author of the 2020 book Editing Humanity: The CRISPR Revolution and the New Era of Genome Editing, also highlighted other voices who've been pointing out the neglect for SCD patients..."", 'But despite these scientific milestones, the experience of SCD patients has not advanced to the same degree. As the late science journalist Sharon Begley put it plainly: ""The U.S. healthcare system is killing adults with sickle cell disease."" And while FDA approval of Casgevy is a moment for celebration, this approach won\'t help the vast majority of patients worldwide. As Dhruv Khullar wrote in the New Yorker: ""If we truly want to cure sickle-cell disease, editing genomes will only get us so far. We\'ll need to rewrite our medical system, too.""', 'Approximately 100,000 people in the US have sickle cell disease (SCD), of mostly African-American descent, and more than 20 million people globally are afflicted.', 'Vertex and CRISPR say they hope to help the 20,000 Americans with the most severe cases of SCD who are willing to take the long road of complex treatment and cost hurdles to potentially transform their lives.', 'As always with debilitating disease and potential cures that offer both promise and risk, it helps to look at the individual stories of patients and their families that transform all the hard numbers into real faces.', 'I\'ve heard at least three of these heart-wrenching stories in the past few months. In a Friday piece for the Wall Street Journal by Joseph Walker, FDA Approves World\'s First Crispr Gene-Editing Drug for Sickle-Cell Disease, he highlighted the story of a woman named Marie Tornyenu who had to be hospitalized sometimes and got monthly transfusions of healthy blood from a donor. Walker described how Tornyenu lived in fear of the bouts of extreme pain in her hips and legs that felt like a ""dull ache that just burns and gets exponentially worse.""', 'Knowing some of the forthcoming risks of the necessary chemotherapy, she began receiving Casgevy treatments in a clinical trial in 2021 after undergoing fertility treatment to preserve her eggs in case she wanted to have children in the future. After a few months, she was in a resurggence where not only the pain was gone but also the effecs of chemo.', 'Walker writes...', 'For the first time, she could take a walk around her neighborhood without getting fatigued. ""I still thought about, \'What if I have pain?\'"" said Tornyenu, 22 years old, of Bethlehem, Pa. ""But the pain never came.""', 'Bottom line on CRSP: The breakthrough medical miracles should continue and open up all kinds of paths for CRISPR technology to make life better for millions of people with other ""incurable"" genetic diseases.', ""Dollar General delivered a mixed Q3 earnings report last Thursday and I wanted to provide an update after my colleague Derek Lewis reported on the company's downward earnings trend last month."", 'In mid-November, Derek wrote ""Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company\'s earnings outlook, with expectations decreasing across all timeframes over the last several months. Negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and crunched profitability paint a challenging picture for the company\'s shares in the near term.""', 'Q3 earnings came in at $1.26 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share but decreased 45.9% from the prior-year period.', 'Net sales of $9,694.1 million rose 2.4% from the prior-year period on sales contributions from new stores, partly offset by a fall in same-store sales and the impact of store closures. The top line came in $48 million, or half a percent, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,646 million.', ""Dollar General's same-store sales fell 1.3% year over year, owing to a lower average transaction amount, partly offset by an increase in customer traffic. Same-store sales reflected declines in the home, seasonal, consumable and apparel categories."", 'Sales increased 3.6% year over year to $ 7,940.5 million for Consumables. However, sales declined 0.2% to $940.6 million for Seasonal, 7% to $534.5 million for Home Products and 1.5% to $278.5 million for the Apparel category.', 'Gross profit dipped 2.5% to $2,812.5 million in the reported quarter and the gross margin decreased 147 basis points to 29%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to lower inventory markups, increased shrink and higher markdowns, partly offset by a lower LIFO provision and decreased transportation costs.', 'The company has been taking actions to accelerate the pace of inventory-reduction efforts and additional investments in planned areas like retail labor to elevate the in-store experience.', 'For fiscal 2023 (ends January), management now projects net sales growth to be in the band of 1.5-2.5% versus the previous expectation of 1.3-3.3%. This includes a negative impact of about two percentage points owing to the lapping fiscal 2022 53rd week. Same-store sales growth is likely to come in the range of a decline of about 1% to flat against the previous guidance range of a 1% decline to 1% growth.', 'For fiscal 2023, the company now expects earnings per share to be $7.10-$7.60 or a decrease of 29-34% versus the prior expectation of about a 22-34% decline. This view includes the adverse impact of nearly four percentage points owing to higher interest expense.', 'After the report, analysts have taken down sales and profit estimates further, likely keeping DG in the doghouse of the Zacks Rank. Current FY23 consensus is now $7.42, representing a 30.5% annual decline and next year looks to only grow 2% from there.', 'In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Dollar General opened 263 stores, remodeled 545 stores and relocated 44 stores. In fiscal 2024 (begins in February), the company anticipates carrying out 2,385 real estate projects, including 800 store openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 store relocations.', 'The company still sees an opportunity to open about 12,000 more stores in the US over the next several years. But given increased capital and construction costs, the pace is slowing versus the 990 store openings in 2023.', 'After reaching for 3-month highs near $140, DG shares were rejected post-earnings. That will likely prove resistance until next quarter since it was also the site of the last earnings gap down in late August.', ""DG may prove to be a value stock again at some point -- it currently trades at an attractive price/sales ratio of 0.7 on about $40 billion in revenues. But we'll need to see a turnaround in the next quarter or two. The Zacks Rank will let you know."", 'Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the market has witnessed wild swings in oil prices. This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby poising Marathon Petroleum Corp., EOG Resources, Inc. and Phillips 66 for growth.', ""We should not forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity's price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020."", 'However, with the rapid development of vaccines by scientists, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at slightly higher than $70 per barrel and has been volatile on weak China demand concerns amid global supply surplus.', 'Overall, the oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.', 'We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks.

The first six months of 2024 would be crucial as this time period will decide whether or not the Fed’s long battle against inflation was successful. After all, Powell does not want to repeat the central bank’s mistake of 1967, where it was too quick to cut rates, only to see the inflation monster come back. But keep the interest rates high for too long and you exacerbate the risks of tipping the economy into recession.

Another 22% planned to do so in the next two years, although historically only a fraction of the companies that planned to implement one have done so.', 'The analysis from CDP, not previously published, reveals both that companies have embraced the new planning tool but also that much debate remains about what prices will spur significant action by companies to cut emissions.', ""Shown the trends, several analysts told Reuters the emerging picture is one of executives getting ready for some type of new emissions regulation even if they lack a clear sense of what's ahead."", 'Companies are ""getting ready for the reality that it’s going to be required"" said Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz.

When carmaker Volvo embraced internal carbon pricing, it could not find a good model to follow because ""very, very few companies"" used such prices throughout their business, Jonas Otterheim, Volvo\'s head of climate action, said in an interview.', 'Volvo has incorporated a ""shadow price"" of 1,000 krona per metric ton, about $92, in decisions ranging from which model vehicles to produce to what materials to use in factories. Adding the cost of carbon pollution to aluminum, for instance, made using aluminum created with renewable energy a ""super high priority"" because it has less than a quarter of the carbon emissions of typically made material, he said.', 'Similarly, Volvo reconsidered the real cost of its bigger cars as stricter EU rules come into effect.', 'The discussion ""actually made us change the whole volume planning of the company to say that we should not prioritize some cars versus other even though they look more profitable, because they will actually sort of give us a penalty that other cars won\'t,"" Otterheim said.', 'Drugmaker Amgen assesses an ""internal fee"" of $1,000 per metric ton on higher-emitting projects.

But the current variation in prices is a problem, especially with some prices below $5 per metric ton.', '""I fear this is going in the direction of greenwashing,"" he said.', 'However, Anita McBain, head of EMEA ESG Research for Citi, said practical uses matter more than high prices.', '“We\'d rather see a carbon price with teeth than one without.

Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', ""Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Public Service Enterprise Group has grown EPS by 14% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Public Service Enterprise Group shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 19% to 33% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$39m. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.1% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture."", ""It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed.

That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies.

Industrial stocks, typically known for their stability and resilience, often outperform the broader market during periods of economic expansion and recovery.

Now, the government plans to put hundreds of billions of dollars into building roads and bridges, bringing back jobs to the US, dealing with climate change, and using more electricity. Legislation like the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are expected to channel hundreds of billions of dollars into these areas. This big investment could help the industrial sector grow a lot in the long run. The report further mentioned that there have been some sectors showing promise for investment opportunities.

In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date?

According to Economic Outlook:\xa0Balancing\xa0Prices & Priorities, while there is no one-size-fits-all story for the Asia Pacific region, the macro picture is expected to be one of modest growth, largely on par with 2023 levels, as economies continue to stabilize and key drivers of growth, like exports and tourism, edge closer to pre-pandemic norms.', 'Drilling down into individual economies, growth expectations are mixed across the region. On one end of the spectrum, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, and South Korea should see upticks while slowdowns are anticipated in Australia, the Chinese Mainland, Japan and New Zealand. India and Indonesia are expected to hold largely steady at 2023 levels.', ""Anticipated Spend ShiftsAs the economic ripple effects of the pandemic subside in 2024, Asia Pacific consumers should be able to allocate a larger share of their wallets to discretionary spend such as travel and entertainment. This is in comparison to 2022-2023, years marked by high inflation, that caused essentials (or 'needs') like groceries and fuel to take up a larger percentage of household budgets, leaving less money left over for 'wants' or extras."", '""2024 is set to be a year of recalibration as consumers rebalance their wallets.

This shift will drive a convergence in performance between the manufacturing and services sectors in the region which trended in opposite directions as manufacturing lagged and services boomed in 2023.', ""The China StoryThe headline for 2024 will be a further recovery of Chinese outbound travel. The addition of more countries to China's approved list for group travel, which typically have less stringent visa restrictions compared to individual travel, will continue to support overseas tourism spending."", ""The recovery of specific corridors will hinge on the authorities' prioritization of flight capacity allocation. While Southeast Asia destinations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand were early outperformers in 2023, it is expected that destinations in Northeast Asia, North America and Europe should catch up in 2024."", '""The recovery in China\'s outbound spending will continue to be closely watched,"" adds Mann. ""Pre-pandemic, tourists from the Chinese Mainland focused heavily on shopping, particularly for luxury goods, when traveling internationally.

There are a few reasons why Hayes likes the stock including that it has aggressively sold off, the ""valuation is tremendous,"" and that it has potential catalysts for the stock to recover some of its losses.', 'The stock Hayes is not buying right now is Eli Lilly (LLY). Hayes argues that the stock has already priced in a lot of good news, there will be increased competition, and that there are still questions about what insurance companies will cover when it comes to obesity drugs.', 'Click here to watch more ""Good Buy or Goodbye"" or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', '[MUSIC PLAYING]', 'JULIE HYMAN: It\'s a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to ""Good Buy or Goodbye,"" brought to you by E-Trade from Morgan Stanley, our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. Today we\'re examining an investment topic that has gained traction in the back half of the year. It\'s weight loss drugs. It\'s hard to avoid the term ""Ozempic,"" especially after a number of celebrities admitted to using the drug.', ""As quickly as the buzz came, the narrative also has turned to overhype. So how should you play it? I'm here with Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital chairman and managing member. And so let's get to your buy stock within this theme. That is Baxter international, which is more on the device side of the equation. Of course, companies like this, and you can see it on the stock chart, have been hit really hard by this weight loss drug craze. And as you point out, that's one of the reasons to like it maybe."", ""THOMAS HAYES: Absolutely. This stock is down 65% since its 2021 high. It's down because of the Hillrom acquisition. They used a lot of debt on that. It's underperformed expectations. But we're starting to see that turnaround. Margins are improving sequentially. So that's very good."", ""Then they had the supply chain issues from COVID. Like all these companies, they built up their inventory tremendously at high cost. They've been working through that inventory for the last two quarters. So we're starting to see the margin expansion . There and then, of course, the GLP-1 fears. That was the final nail in the coffin. You saw it on the lower right side of that chart."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. We can take it back for a real quick.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, look at this. Right here.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, most definitely.', ""THOMAS HAYES: That was when everyone was saying, everyone's going to lose weight. No one is ever going to get a medical procedure again, because we're going to be healthy. But the problem is even if they're correct and we lose all that weight, we all go out and play pickleball. And we have knee problems. We have shoulder problems. We have hip problems. We play golf. We get more active."", ""So those are the three reasons that it's down. We think the valuation is tremendous here, which goes to our next point."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. So let's talk about the valuation a little bit, valuation and performance, as you point out. And you're looking specifically at the price to sales ratio as a measure of valuation. Obviously, you've seen that come down also."", ""THOMAS HAYES: Yeah. It's trading at 1.2 times sales. This is very, very low historically and just absolutely. It's also trading its historic PE multiple, Price-to-Earnings multiple. Historically, it's been about 19 times, because this has been a grower. This business is compounded capital return on invested capital of double digits for decades now. So this is a proven business."", ""But the PE multiple is trading down to 12 times next year's earnings, in opposition to its average multiple of 19 times. And that's largely due to the kidney business. The renal care business is the slowest growth division. And they're going to spin that out to shareholders. So--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: So you think that should unlock some value. And just to point out to our viewers, this is about, I think, a 10-year chart here or nearly so. So it shows you definitely over the long term just how low that price-to-sales ratio is on a comparative basis. And so you mentioned one potential catalyst for recovery. That is the spin-off of that renal business. What are some of the other potentials?', ""THOMAS HAYES: Well, a couple of things. First off, they sold off the biopharma business. They got $4 billion of that. So that's going to help them deleverage. That's been a weight the interest expense. That's going to take about $180 million a year of interest expense out of the business."", ""The key thing about that renal care spin is that once you take the slowest growth division out of the equation and that spun to shareholders, what's remaining Baxter Co-- remainco, that's going to start to trade rerate at a higher multiple, because it has a higher growth rate. Management is expecting prospectively that it's going to grow revenues at 4% to 5%. The margins are improving sequentially as we work through the supply chain issues. So we really like the story."", ""We think Baxter can work its way back to $60 over the next 12 to 24 months. So it's a longer-term play. There'll be some bumps in the road along the way. But we do think the GLP hype is a little overblown here."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So we like to ask people what the biggest risk then is for that bullish case here. And you're saying maybe it has to do with pricing power."", ""THOMAS HAYES: Yeah. I think management has in their assumption of the long-term topline growth rate of 4% to 5%, that they're going to have some pricing power. And the risk to that is they have competition that have similar products out there, and they don't innovate quickly enough. But they've shown a track record of innovation, even on the pharma side with their launches, their injection business, et cetera. So we're pretty confident that this is not going to come to bear, but it's something to keep in mind as a risk."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So that's your good buy looking at this whole weight loss universe. Let's talk about the stock you're saying adios to in this scenario. And that is Eli Lilly, which is your goodbye in this scenario. So let's walk through the thesis on this one. You say it's already priced for perfection. So maybe not a lot of room for error."", ""THOMAS HAYES: That's correct. So it's priced in a lot of really, really good news. It's historically traded at about 27 times earnings. It's trading at 48 times next year's earnings as opposed to Baxter, which is trading at 1.2 times sales. This is trading at 15 times sales. This is unprecedented. You're paying for-- not 15 years of profits, you're paying for 15 years basically of revenue."", 'And we understand the growth. We understand the valuation. But this is really just gotten too ahead of itself, even if you believe all the good things are going to happen.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Right. And we should just mention there, actually happened to have been some news today on Eli Lilly. Zepbound, which is their specific weight loss drug that is basically counterpart to Mounjaro, the diabetes drug. There was a new study that came out and said people who were on it, once they were off it for a year, they gained back half of their weight. Now there's still a lot lighter than they used to be. But nonetheless, that was hitting the stock a little bit in today's session. So just something to think about as well for folks."", ""So competition with lower prices is one of the other things that you're looking at."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Expectations or these type of drugs, the GLP-1s, number one, you've got to pay the $1,000 or $1,400 a month, or it starts to come back, both on this one. And it's expected on the other ones. But it's expected that the price of these drugs is going to erode from $14,000 a year down to $3,000 a year over the next decade. And it's going to become a MeToo product. There are already multiple companies that make similar drugs. So there's going to be more and more enter the fray."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, and then there's the question of, OK, and who exactly is going to pay for it when you're looking at this thing? Let's go here. So in other words, is insurance going to cover it?"", ""THOMAS HAYES: Yeah. And so far, the jury is still out, because, if you look at the excess cost of a diabetic is about $9,000 a year for the insurance companies. Right now some of these top tier drugs are $14,000 to $18,000 a year. So the math equation doesn't work just yet. That might get better."", ""But best case scenario, they're expecting the analysts, and you heard before, about 15% of the morbidly obese people will be on it within 10 years. So that's kind of a relatively small portion of the population. If you think about the top 10% of households, 190,000 of income, if they're self-payers, $14,000 a year is a lot of money. And what about the other 90% of the population that may need it?"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. OK. So what could go right for Eli Lilly and therefore wrong for your thesis here? If we can get that to come up, I think we're a little-- oh, there we go. Insurance coverage begins to accelerate."", ""THOMAS HAYES: Yeah. I think as the costs come down, the equation may improve for insurance companies to start to cover it. They may say if we put them on this at $5,000 a year or $7,000 a year, we're going to have to pay for a lot less procedures down the road as their health gets better."", ""The other thing is they have an Alzheimer's drug that's expected to be approved. Maybe the results will be better than expected. That could be a complete game changer."", ""So there are some positive catalysts here certainly that could change this thesis. And we do think it's going to continue to put out great products. It's just we're not willing to pay this current price."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And just quickly, do you have positions in either Baxter or Lilly?', 'THOMAS HAYES: We own Baxter. We have no position in Lilly.', ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. Thanks a lot, Tom. So let's sum up what you have told us here today. You're telling investors buy Baxter International based on the stock recently selling off. It's becoming cheaper on a valuation basis. And there are some catalysts for recovery. On the other side, you're saying avoid Eli Lilly. It's already priced for perfection. The stock could face competition from those with lower prices. And there are some problematic assumptions regarding pricing and how much insurance is going to cover."", 'Tom Hayes, thanks so much for coming in. Appreciate it.', 'THOMAS HAYES: Thanks so much, Julie.', 'JULIE HYMAN: And thank you so much for watching. ""Good Buy or Goodbye."" We\'re going to be bringing you new episodes three times a week at 3:30 PM Eastern.']"

The company is set to gain from the acquisition of Cooper Tire, the Goodyear Forward plan and strategic restructuring in the EMEA segment. \xa0The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Goodyear’s 2023 revenues and earnings per share is pegged at $20.3 billion and 5 cents, respectively.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why Goodyear is an attractive pick.', ""Cooper Tire Buyout Serves as a Key Catalyst: The acquisition of Cooper Tire, which closed in June 2021, has strengthened Goodyear's leadership position in the U.S. tire industry and expanded its foothold in other North American markets. The complementary product offerings, scale expansion and value addition from both production and distribution standpoints are boosting the firm’s top line.Goodyear Forward Transformation Plan: Goodyear's transformative initiative, dubbed Goodyear Forward, bodes well. The plan, designed to optimize the company's portfolio, enhance margins and reduce leverage, aims to unlock significant value for shareholders. With a goal to raise more than $2 billion from portfolio optimization, Goodyear is actively exploring strategic alternatives for its chemical, Dunlop and Off-the-Road equipment tire businesses. The tire manufacturer anticipates a run-rate benefit of $1.3 billion by 2025, driven by $1 billion in cost cuts and an additional $300 million from top-line actions. Positioned for substantial growth, Goodyear targets a doubled operating margin, moving from nearly 5% in 2023 to 10% by the end of 2025, aligning with debt reduction goals and a stronger financial profile.Strategic EMEA Restructuring: Goodyear's strategic restructuring in the EMEA segment is likely to reap benefits. The company's focus on operational efficiency through streamlining product business units, centralizing functions and optimizing shared services is poised to enhance competitiveness and foster growth. The streamlining actions are expected to result in savings of $30-$35 million in 2024 and $100 million by 2025 from the 2022 baseline.Praiseworthy Electrification Strides: Encouragingly, Goodyear has secured a leadership position in electric mobility by developing tires that will help transform its portfolios to include more energy-efficient and eco-friendly vehicles.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the industrial sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The industrial sector in the US is a cornerstone of the economy, encompassing manufacturing, construction, mining, and utilities. The industry has undergone significant transformations, adapting to globalization, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer demands. Automation and digitalization have revolutionized production methods, improving efficiency but also altering the employment landscape. Industrial stocks, typically known for their stability and resilience, often outperform the broader market during periods of economic expansion and recovery. However, despite their historical strength, this year has seen a deviation from the norm. The S&P 500 Industrial Index, which tracks the performance of companies like General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), has gained 10.53% in 2023 so far, compared with a 20.7% gain of the S&P 500.', ""Despite the industrial sector's underperformance this year, analysts see this as an opportunity for potential investment. Fidelity Investments mentioned in a report that the US hasn't invested enough in industries for many years. Problems with supply chains during the pandemic and global tensions made it clear that the US should be more self-reliant in industry stuff. Now, the government plans to put hundreds of billions of dollars into building roads and bridges, bringing back jobs to the US, dealing with climate change, and using more electricity. Legislation like the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are expected to channel hundreds of billions of dollars into these areas. This big investment could help the industrial sector grow a lot in the long run. The report further mentioned that there have been some sectors showing promise for investment opportunities. These include commercial aerospace, utility infrastructure, residential construction, and shipping companies."", ""Another report from Morningstar also backed up this perspective. According to their findings, construction firms have been leading the way in stock performance this year. However, companies more focused on commercial construction have fallen behind, mainly because of worries surrounding the commercial real estate market. The report also highlighted the firm's positive view of the construction industry in the long term. They believe that despite certain short-term setbacks, there's a favorable outlook. They pointed out that the IRA is likely to keep supporting the industry, especially by encouraging eco-friendly building methods and materials."", 'Although many investors view AI as primarily related to technology, Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities, suggests that the potential advantages of industrials might be an overlooked storyline that deserves a closer look. Sohn mentioned in his interview that the industrial sector had shown strong performance over the past few months. He suggested that the effects of this trend were becoming evident in various securities. According to FactSet data, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) has surged by nearly 11% this year, accompanied by inflows surpassing $903 million as of August 2023. He added that for investors seeking a broader investment scope beyond the technology surge, industrials stand positioned to gain advantages from the surge in AI-driven efficiency and productivity, particularly within robotics and automation companies.', 'Many industrial companies, especially those with established positions and stable cash flows, tend to pay out dividends regularly.

If you want to skip out on finding out who the mysterious investor is and want to skip to the top five stocks, then take a look at Top 5 Stocks of Eisler Capital. "", ""Is playing with stocks akin to playing with fire? Well, the answer depends on who you ask, but one thing that's for sure is that the stock market is one of the most readily available mediums through which one can become a billionaire. Getting to the top of the global wealth food chain isn't easy. Most people become billionaires by taking huge personal and financial risks. For instance, the richest person in the world right now is Elon Musk known primarily for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX). However, Mr. Musk wasn't the world's richest person in 2008 - which was one of the worst years of his life. Back then, Musk was sleeping on couches after he'd sold everything he had and plowed the money into the two companies. He would often wake up screaming at night due to the stress, showing the tremendous work that's needed if you want to live the rest of your life without worrying about money."", ""However, while Mr. Musk is arguably the best known billionaire in the modern world (he has a whopping 165 million Twitter/X followers after all) others manage more money than most dream of. One such money manager is Edward Eisler of Eisler Capital. Eisler Capital is a British investment management company headquartered in London, the United Kingdom. According to Insider Monkey's research, as of the end of the third quarter of this year, the firm's investment portfolio was worth $15.8 billion. This value reflects all the money (borrowed and owned) that the fund has piled into stock investments, and the fund's actual total assets under management (AUM) sit at $3.7 billion according to data from Reuters."", ""When compared to some other funds that focus on specific market segments such as small cap stocks or distressed debt, Eisler Capital's investments are more diversified. The fund primarily invests in six key areas which are namely equities, assets influenced by macroeconomic indicators, bonds, credit securities, commodities, and emerging markets. As you're likely to have understood, this provides Eisler Capital with a broad buffer against a downturn in one sector. For instance, in 2022, when the stock market was crashing, the commodities sector was roaring, to provide Eisler a nice way to buffer against any downturns."", ""Eisler Capital is a relatively young hedge fund since it was set up in 2012. However, like other hedge fund founders, Mr. Eisler was also a seasoned finance professional before he set up his hedge fund. He worked at the investment bank Goldman Sachs for two decades before deciding to venture into financial entrepreneurship. Setting up Eisler wasn't initially planned to be the end of this journey as Mr. Eisler had also planned to set up another firm that would have invested in emerging markets. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine which saw it annex Crimea in 2014 stopped these plans."", 'Since then, Eisler Capital has come a long way and won several laurels as well as attracted criticism. While you might not become a billionaire as an Eisler employee, you sure can become the next best thing i.e. a multimillionaire. The fact that Eisler is a British company means that it can file its financials with the Companies House, and this data shows that in 2022, an average Eisler employee made a cool $1.2 million. Even better off was the most highly paid director, whose remuneration stood at an even cooler $4.2 million. However, these figures are far higher than the historic averages at the firm, and they come after it spent a busy 2021 expanding its employee headcount and growing its global presence.', ""There's no such thing as a free lunch though, and while employees at Eisler are paid millions of dollars each year, during the six months that ended in September, 12 employees left the firm. The hedge fund had 153 employees per month on average in 2022, so if the number of departures is higher then it could easily have lost ten percent of its workforce."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at Eisler Capital's latest stock picks. Some notable names are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)."", 'An Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of the little known billion dollar fund Eisler Capital's top stock picks, we used its Q3 2023 SEC filings and picked out the top stocks."", ""Eisler Capital's Q3 2023 Investment: $38.7 million"", ""The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the biggest industrial companies in the world.

Further, the company is developing sample-to-answer solutions to catalyze adoption in the clinical setting, including in reproductive and genetic health and oncology.In reproductive health, the company primarily focuses on driving noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) adoption globally through technology, which identifies fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cell-free DNA in maternal blood. The market adoption of the NGS technology is also accelerating the research for rare and undiagnosed diseases to discover the genetic causes of inherited disorders by assessing many genes simultaneously.In the United States, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Tennessee updated their state Medicaid coverage for NIPT in all pregnancies. Across Europe, NIPT is currently available for all pregnancies in the Netherlands and has been approved for broader coverage in Italy. This year, the company also announced a partnership with Henry Ford Health, to assess the impact of comprehensive genomic testing in cardiovascular disease, particularly in diverse and underserved populations.', 'Illumina, Inc. price | Illumina, Inc.

Illumina opened a new office and state-of-the-art Solutions Center in Bengaluru, India, to grow the genomics market in the most populous country in the world, unlocking opportunities for advancing health care and combating the effects of climate change in South Asia.', ""The NovaSeq X launch has further strengthened Illumina's competitive position in high-throughput sequencing. The sophisticated platform includes the most comprehensive end-to-end software the company has released to date. The strong global interest in the NovaSeq X series has led to its rollout occurring at a strong magnitude and pace.During the third quarter, Illumina saw encouraging trends across both its research and clinical high-throughput customers who have a NovaSeq X installed. On both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, these customers have shown higher overall growth in sequencing output than high-throughput customers who are yet to adopt NovaSeq X. The company exited the quarter with more than 310 orders since launch, with the total installed base being 273 instruments."", 'On the flip side, Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL remains subject to ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings in the United States and the European Union.', 'As of Oct 1, 2023, Illumina’s accrued liabilities included $458 million and also comprised related foreign currency gains. In addition, the company also remains at risk of further fines, penalties, remedies or restrictions from the European Commission, the FTC and/or other governmental or regulatory authorities.Currently, GRAIL is held and operated separately and independently from Illumina pursuant to the transitional measures ordered by the European Commission in the EC Divestment Decision, which prohibited the company’s acquisition of GRAIL under the EU Merger Regulation. Other than the uncertainty surrounding GRAIL integration, these regulatory complications are raising the legal expenses for Illumina, thereby building pressure on the bottom line.', ""Further, the current macroeconomic scenario, including the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which began in 2022, and the sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries have impacted the company’s ability to ship products to affected regions and customers. Furthermore, the slowdown of COVID-19 surveillance and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, exchange rates and competitive challenges in China, have impacted both Illumina’s business performance and customers’ behavior. In the near term, management does not expect these headwinds to lessen.In the third quarter, total sequencing consumable revenues were also impacted by COVID-19, Russia and China factors, as well as macroeconomic conditions on customers' purchasing power and project planning.

Let's take a look at some trending tickers here as well. I'm going to start with Nike shares, running into the green after-- there you go-- after Citi upgraded the stock from neutral to buy, raises target ahead of the company's quarterly results. So go to buy. Target goes to 135. And basically telling clients this note, Julie, listen, topline challenges remain. But what they do like they see gross margin recovery starting in Q2 2024, new innovation coming, they say, next year ahead of the Olympics and what they describe as a solid position in China. Bottom line, they note one of a kind brand with visible margin recovery creates, in their opinion, favorable risk reward."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And you know, it's interesting, too, because Nike has sort of lost a little bit of its mojo. It was such a solid performer for so long. This has not been a great year for Nike. And the way that I took this note from Citi and Paul Lejuez over there is that what we have seen Nike doing is basically pricing its shoes to sell and sacrificing gross margin as a result."", ""And what he says is now we're going to see that switch. And that even if they see sales a little weaker, and he does say that they are going to see sales a little weaker, that that gross margin is more than going to make up for it. So kind of a flip in the Nike strategy here that they're no longer going to be sacrificing sales-- that they are going to be sacrificing sales but making up for it with the gross margin. So we'll see if that actually comes to fruition."", ""At the same time, we also have a call out from Citi on Broadcom with a buy rating. Shares of the chip maker are rising in today's trading session as a result of that. And interesting here, we heard from Broadcom last week with its earnings. But the analyst over at Citi says that there's strength in the company's core business. They like the VMware acquisition as well, which recently closed."", ""And what's interesting on a broader level, too, is that Broadcom has been on a tear recently."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Huge.', 'JULIE HYMAN: You know, so that--', 'JOSH LIPTON: Huge at this move, yeah.', ""JULIE HYMAN: So that's been kind of the theme that you and I have been watching."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I mean, if you've been in Broadcom this year, you're sitting pretty. I mean, the stock just hit a record high. It's up now more than 80% in 2023. And most analysts are fans of this stock. I mean, they-- listen, they like the C-suite. They like Hock Tan, the CEO. They like this management team."", ""You'll see as you go through the notes, they really like the strategy under Hock Tan, the business model. Remember, they've been pivoting to higher margin software. And they see this company benefiting from exposure to AI within its networking business. So that is another tailwind that has certainly been working for the bulls this year."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And just want to point out, I've called up the semiconductors real quick on the YFi interactive, because what's been interesting as of late, and this is a trend that the Wall Street Journal pointed out today, one of these things is not like the other. And it's the thing that was doing amazingly well. I'm talking about Nvidia, of course. The stock is down 1.9% today, but that's been happening more recently that we have seen some of the other chip makers start to catch up with that Nvidia monster move this year."", ""Just today, not only do you have Broadcom, which still confusingly its ticker is AVGO because of Avago, but ASML, AMD is higher. Intel up 4% on the day. If you look at that versus the year-to-date performance, it is quite a different picture. Nvidia, the clear leader, although everything else is up as well. It's just Nvidia has been up more thus far this year."", ""JOSH LIPTON: It has been-- and part of that story has been the AI play. And it continues-- it continues to work for them. Finally, let's end on RingCentral, because there are some big changes their. CEO Tarek Robbiati is resigning from the company effective December 8. This coming just a few short months after taking the helm. RingCentral's founder Vlad Shmunis to return to his full-time role as chief executive officer."", ""You know, Julie, investors don't like surprises. And this was one, right? This was a big one. When your CEO abruptly exits, that caught them off guard. And as we know, his appointment has only been in effect since late August actually. So now we have Vlad founder and executive chairman returning as CEO. A company, we should note, did reiterate Q4 and annual guidance. But this took some folks by surprise."", ""JULIE HYMAN: yeah, Most definitely. And also Tarek Robbiati was CFO at HPE. So then he came and joined RingCentral from another large company and now exiting here, not seeing a lot of explanations what's happening here. But definitely, analysts seeing this as abrupt and as a surprise to your point here. Piper Sandler saying that-- pointing out that recently the CFO canceled a conference last week because of illness. And so really, investors are trying to understand what's going on here, that they're looking for some kind of strategic change for the company."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, I think a lot more questions here for sure.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, most definitely.']"

During the quarter, Lululemon signed\xa0a deal with\xa0its former foe\xa0Peloton\xa0Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON). As part of the five-year partnership with Peloton, Lululemon got to ditch its Mirror home workout device as well as end producing its Fitness classes as Peloton streaming classes will be available in its studio.

But Lululemon did build a strong brand, but only time will tell if its brand value is sustainable. As for its union for Peloton, although a good idea for the two companies to focus on their core competencies, the deal has yet to yield results.\xa0Although Lululemon’s financials took a short-term hit due its shutdown of\xa0its Mirror business,\xa0Lululemon is pushing ahead as it posted revenue growth and topped earnings estimates.', 'DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Pfizer has prepared for this moment by developing new products to generate future revenue growth. The company is executing its biggest streak of product launches ever right now -- with the goal of releasing 19 new products or indications in 18 months. So far, it's completed 13 of those launches."", 'Pfizer also is gaining new potential revenue streams through acquisitions.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for its anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (anti-TFPI) candidate marstacimab for individuals living with hemophilia A or hemophilia B without inhibitors to Factor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX). The European marketing authorization application (MAA) for marstacimab also passed validation and is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).', 'The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a decision from the European Commission is anticipated by the first quarter of 2025. If approved in the U.S. and EU, marstacimab is expected to become the first once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for people living with hemophilia B and the first treatment administered as a flat dose for people living with hemophilia A or B.', '""Marstacimab has demonstrated that it may be an efficacious treatment option with once-weekly, subcutaneous flat-dose administration via an auto-injector pen, for appropriate patients, if approved. This is critical as intravenous infusions are typically required for people living with these diseases today,"" said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Research and Development, Pfizer. ""We look forward to progressing the review of this novel therapy with the FDA, EMA, and global regulatory authorities to bring this important medicine to patients globally.""', 'For more than five decades, the most common treatment approach for hemophilia A and B has been factor replacement therapy, which replaces missing clotting factors to facilitate proper blood coagulation.i Marstacimab is a novel, investigational treatment for hemophilia that is designed to restore hemostasis by inhibiting TFPI. For appropriate patients living with hemophilia A and B, the goal of this treatment is to prevent potentially life-threatening bleeds with a once-weekly, subcutaneous flat-dose administration.', 'The submissions for marstacimab are based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 BASIS trial (NCT03938792). Key findings were recently presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on December 9, 2023. The inhibitor cohort of the BASIS trial has completed enrollment and is expected to read out as early as late 2024.', 'About Marstacimab', 'Marstacimab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G isotype, subclass 1 (IgG1) that targets the Kunitz 2 domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a natural anticoagulation protein that functions to prevent the formation of blood clots. Marstacimab is in development as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia A or hemophilia B with or without inhibitors.', 'In September 2019, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track designation to marstacimab for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A with inhibitors or hemophilia B with inhibitors.', 'Pfizer has three Phase 3 programs investigating treatments for people living with hemophilia: marstacimab, fidanacogene elaparvovec (hemophilia B), and giroctocogene fitelparvovec (hemophilia A).', 'About the BASIS study', 'BASIS is a global Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study evaluating annual bleed rate (ABR) through 12 months of treatment with marstacimab, an investigational, novel subcutaneous therapy option, in approximately 145 adolescent and adult participants ages 12 to <75 years with severe hemophilia A (defined as FVIII <1%) or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B (defined as FIX activity ≤2%) with or without inhibitors. Approximately 15% of participants are adolescents (ages 12 to <18 years old). This study is comparing treatment with a run-in period for patients prescribed factor replacement therapy or bypass therapy during a six-month Observational Phase with a 12-month Active Treatment Phase, during which participants receive prophylaxis (a 300 mg subcutaneous loading dose of marstacimab, followed by 150 mg subcutaneously once weekly) with potential for dose escalation to 300 mg once weekly.', 'Pfizer is also conducting BASIS KIDS, an open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of marstacimab in children ages 1 to <18 years with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B with or without inhibitors. The study will compare 12 months of historical standard treatment to marstacimab prophylaxis.', 'About Hemophilia', 'Hemophilia is a family of rare genetic blood diseases caused by a clotting factor deficiency (FVIII in hemophilia A, FIX in hemophilia B), which prevents normal blood clotting. Hemophilia is diagnosed in early childhood and impacts more than 400,000 people worldwide.ii The inability of the blood to clot properly can increase the risk of painful bleeding inside the joints, which can cause joint scarring and damage. People living with hemophilia can suffer permanent joint damage following repeated bleeding episodes.i,ii', 'For decades, the most common treatment approach for hemophilia A and B has been factor replacement therapy, which replaces the missing clotting factors. Factor replacement therapies increase the amount of clotting factor in the body to levels that improve clotting, resulting in less bleeding.iii,iv Approximately 25-30% of people with hemophilia A and 3-5% of people with hemophilia B are unable to continue taking factor replacement therapies because they develop inhibitors to FVIII and FIX.v,vi', 'In a survey of people in the U.S. receiving prophylaxis for hemophilia A or B, nearly one-third of those that receive treatment and have high compliance – defined as taking 75% or more of their prescribed infusions – stated that the time-consuming nature of prophylaxis was the most significant challenge of the regimen.vii,viii Nearly 60% of those that took the less than the prescribed number of infusions reported that the time commitment was the primary reason for missing infusions.', 'About Pfizer: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ Lives', ""At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

At the current price, PayPal stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 11. But before you decide if that's a bargain, there are three things you need to know about this company and its stock."", ""PayPal's revenue growth decelerated over the past two years or so. There are several reasons for this. One is simply the massive growth it enjoyed early in the pandemic, which was challenging to build on. Add to that a slowdown in e-commerce as people returned to physical store shopping, and an abundance of new fintech companies cropping up as digital shopping has become mainstream."", ""But even at these rates, PayPal is growing, and it's investing in its platform to remain relevant and generate engagement and sales. PayPal stock is down, but PayPal as a business has plenty of growth drivers (I'll get to that in a second) and is focusing on profitability. That could lead to a higher stock price."", ""Let's try a little exercise to see how this could work. PayPal stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18. For the price to double at the same ratio, earnings per share (EPS) would need to double as well. It's almost doubled over the past five years, and it's reasonable to envision it doing that again. But will the valuation stay the same? Its three-year price-to-earnings average is 52, but it's unlikely to go back there anytime soon."", 'We can try 25 as a reasonable valuation when the situation improves. At that valuation, for the stock to double from where it is today, trailing 12-month EPS would need to be $4.80. Management is guiding for 2023 EPS of $3.75, so that would be a 28% increase. You can see how PayPal stock can jump very quickly depending on its financial performance.', ""To further this argument, take a look at this chart. It demonstrates that until recently, PayPal's stock price moved in tandem with its EPS. They diverged only this year, as EPS has increased, but PayPal's stock hasn't. This is what you'd call an undervalued stock, where you would expect the stock price to rise to meet the real value."", 'PYPL data by YCharts', ""One of PayPal's growth drivers is the reacceleration of e-commerce.

Quantum computing is an entirely new way for computers to operate."", ""These machines use atomic particles, such as electrons and ions, to execute calculations instead of the binary system of zeroes and ones employed by today's computers. This approach allows quantum computers to process mountains of complex data at a scale impossible for any conventional computer. Quantum computers are so powerful they can make obsolete many of the cybersecurity measures currently available. This is why organizations worldwide are working to implement quantum computing."", ""Two companies developing this tech are veteran IBM (NYSE: IBM) and newcomer IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). Owning either stock gives you exposure to the exciting technology of quantum computing, but since the field is still nascent, is one of these a better choice over the long haul as quantum computing ramps up? Let's look at each company to see whether there's a clear choice."", 'In 2021, IonQ became the first publicly traded business solely focused on quantum computing. In its brief history as a public company, IonQ has experienced rapidly rising revenue.

Also, IonQ possesses a strong balance sheet, with total assets of $565 million, with $384 million of that in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Total liabilities were $67 million."", ""Although IBM's business is focused on cloud computing and AI solutions, it's seen as one of the leaders in the quantum computing field.

Various sectors experienced contrasting outcomes, influenced by ongoing political and economic factors. The energy sector in the US maintained stability throughout 2022, largely attributed to elevated prices and limited supplies. Closing the year with remarkable growth, it surged by 58% by December 30, a stark contrast to the S&P 500's approximately 20% decline. Notably, according to Dow Jones Market Data, this marked the first instance of the energy sector standing out as the sole victor in the S&P 500 annual performance, and it was the only sector that didn't witness a decline throughout the year. This year, the situation has reversed, as energy stocks are now trailing behind the overall market performance. The S&P 500 Energy is down by 7.31% in 2023 so far, compared with a 20.40% gain of the S&P 500."", 'In addition to this, the largest American exchange-traded fund (ETF) that follows clean energy stocks was set to mark its highest yearly outflows ever due to several factors. Rapidly increasing interest rates, rising prices of raw materials, and disruptions in the supply chain have diminished the appeal of this fund for investors. As per Lipper data, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF has recorded more than $1 billion in net outflows as of November 2023. This ETF, which was once favored during the pandemic, had experienced substantial net inflows of over $2 billion annually in both 2020 and 2021. However, investors have been pulling out of this ETF amid the escalation of interest rates. Moreover, more investors are heavily invested in technology stocks compared to energy stocks than they have been since September 2021, according to a Bank of America survey. The report mentioned that the managers have allocated the least amount of money to energy shares since December 2020.', ""Despite a recent slowdown, energy stocks have proven advantageous for investors over the past three years, soaring by more than 200%. This growth aligned with the rise in oil prices from their low points over multiple years. These years serve as a valuable lesson for investors, illustrating the correlation between energy stock performance and substantial fluctuations in oil prices. Moreover, the energy sector has changed notably, with many companies allocating more funds to dividends for investors while cutting back on new drilling. This shift has reshaped how energy investments work, underscoring these companies' evolving strategies focused on boosting returns for shareholders."", ""Analysts are also positive about the sector’s outlook. Todd\xa0 Sohn, a managing director in ETF and technical strategy, mentioned in an interview that there's a slight improvement in energy's performance despite the outflows. This doesn't stand as a clear signal on its own, but it hints at a positive change in sentiment. He suggests that this situation could now be seen as an opportunity for a contrarian move.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:', 'CRISPR Therapeutics just made history on Friday with the first FDA-approved gene-editing medicine based on the Nobel Prize-winning discovery that targets disease with the billion-year old defense mechanism bacteria use to battle viruses.', 'CRISPR -- which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -- was discovered and described as a potential gene modifying treatment in a paper published in 2012 by biochemist Jennifer Doudna and microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier.', 'Their research collaboration, which began in 2011 when the two scientists met at a conference, set them on the trail of an ancient mystery they were both deeply interested in: how did some bacteria defeat invading viruses with such precision and consistency?', 'It turns out that bacteria could learn to ""edit"" the DNA of viruses with a built-in ""molecular scalpel"" and permanently disable their ability to replicate within the host. Doudna and Charpentier found that bacteria were leaving detailed clues about this warfare technology through clustered and repeated sequences of genetic code.', 'In 2020, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of the CRISPR/Cas9 ""genetic scissors."" Cas is short for ""CRISPR-associated"" and used to designate the different enzymes involved with a particular gene.', ""In a special edition of Zacks Confidential tonight I'll be doing a deeper dive on the dynamic duo of CRISPR. And I'll also be discussing at least four other stocks that are the best ways to play the CRISPR revolution. Right now, let's look at the news and the numbers that sparked an 80%+ rally in CRSP shares in November."", ""I have been an investor in CRISPR stocks since 2017 when I launched my Healthcare Innovators portfolio service. And to say it's been a bumpy road -- for both the R&D and the stocks -- would be putting it lightly. (That's to say nothing of the legal and patent battles over the science which are sure to come back around.)"", ""Gene editing is scary to many people, and word of rogue experiments in China didn't help its public reputation for the approval of clinical trials. I recall holding shares of Editas Medicine for round-trips between $20 and $90 -- twice!"", 'I tried to hang on through the ups and the downs, believing the bigger medical breakthroughs and inevitable stock breakout would come (with fingers crossed). Alas, as investors we instead entered a long ""CRISPR winter.""', 'The great news is that the dedicated R&D work of scientists and medical professionals stayed warm and fruitful during these years. And thankfully I was buying both EDIT and CRSP near their lows in 2023.', 'CRSP is currently a Zacks #2 Rank Buy as EPS estimates have climbed over 30% in the past two months because over a dozen covering analysts raised the consensus loss for this year from -$4.83 to -$3.27.', 'I now expect estimates for next year to also rise significantly after this historic approval, and push the stock into the upper deck of the Zacks Rank.', 'So what made the FDA launch this landmark leap for gene-editing and bring such a controversial science to the medical marketplace?', 'First, on October 31, an FDA Advisory Committee panel met to discuss the risks and benefits of the investigational treatment ""exa-cel"" (exagamglogene autotemcel) from CRISPR and its ""big brother"" partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals.', 'Exa-cel was designed and tested in clinical trials to treat two debilitating blood disorders, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.', 'The FDA challenge: One of the unique hurdles for CRISPR technologies is the potential for ""off-target"" edits of other genes that could be turned off, replaced, altered or eliminated. And this was one of the primary themes of the meeting of the Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies AdCom.', 'The FDA opportunity: An FDA green light would make exa-cel the first approved drug using CRISPR and could offer a permanent solution for patients with severe SCD, a genetic disorder where red blood cells morph into a collapsed ""sickle"" shape that makes it difficult for them to travel in the bloodstream.', 'From the NIH website on Sickle Cell Disease...', 'SCD is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders that affect hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the body. Normally, red blood cells are disc-shaped and flexible enough to move easily through the blood vessels. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells become crescent- or ""sickle""-shaped due to a genetic mutation. These sickled red blood cells do not bend or move easily and can block blood flow to the rest of the body.', 'Bottom line on FDA AdCom: The panel agreed that there were theoretical off-target edit risks for exa-cel, but overall it was unanimous that its efficacy benefit outweighs that risk. While this was not a formal FDA approval (just an Advisory Committee) the news was very encouraging and gave several Wall Street analysts, many of whom are either MDs or PhDs in the life sciences, greater confidence in an eventual FDA approval.', 'Following the Oct 31 AdCom, Truist analysts led by Dr. Joon Lee reiterated their $220 price target on CRSP shares as they envision strong physician support and sales for Casgevy (the commercial name for exa-cel) once it hits the market.', ""Then, on November 16 after a 2-week 50% rally in CRSP shares, the UK became the first national health regulator to approve Casgevy.

In Europe, insurance companies have resisted the need to pay for therapies costing over $1 million per patient.', ""And this proposed treatment is particularly complex as it involves extracting blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow, editing those cells in the lab ex vivo (outside the body), and then infusing them back into the patient's body. This ex vivo approach is considered less risky because it can avoid off-target edits to other genes. But this complex treatment regime also includes chemotherapy and patients must be hospitalized for a month or possibly longer."", 'On Friday after the FDA announcement, Vertex and CRISPR revealed the price tag for the Casgevy treatment in SCD: $2.2 million. The market reaction by CRSP investors, after a pre-FDA spike on Friday above $75 to 16-month highs, was a classic ""sell the news"" back down to the mid-$60s. But volume was enormous at 17 million shares and that told me buyers were coming in off the lows near $62.', ""More important than investor reaction right now, for me anyway, was the response of one Nobel laureate with a huge stake in the development of CRISPR science into actual medicines. In her 2017 book, A Crack In Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, she took a strong ethical stand on the power of technologies such as CRISPR to be misused. Here's what she had to say upon the FDA approval of Casgevy..."", '""Going from the lab to an approved CRISPR therapy in just 11 years is a truly remarkable achievement,"" Doudna said, adding she was especially pleased that the approval helps patients with ""a disease that has long been neglected by the medical establishment.""', 'Writing for Genetic Engineering & Technology News, Kevin Davies, PhD. shared this perspective...', 'It is ironic that the first approved CRISPR therapy -- a technology barely ten years old -- should be for the genetic disorder that Linus Pauling famously dubbed ""the first molecular disease"" almost 75 years ago.', ""Davies, author of the 2020 book Editing Humanity: The CRISPR Revolution and the New Era of Genome Editing, also highlighted other voices who've been pointing out the neglect for SCD patients..."", 'But despite these scientific milestones, the experience of SCD patients has not advanced to the same degree. As the late science journalist Sharon Begley put it plainly: ""The U.S. healthcare system is killing adults with sickle cell disease."" And while FDA approval of Casgevy is a moment for celebration, this approach won\'t help the vast majority of patients worldwide. As Dhruv Khullar wrote in the New Yorker: ""If we truly want to cure sickle-cell disease, editing genomes will only get us so far. We\'ll need to rewrite our medical system, too.""', 'Approximately 100,000 people in the US have sickle cell disease (SCD), of mostly African-American descent, and more than 20 million people globally are afflicted.', 'Vertex and CRISPR say they hope to help the 20,000 Americans with the most severe cases of SCD who are willing to take the long road of complex treatment and cost hurdles to potentially transform their lives.', 'As always with debilitating disease and potential cures that offer both promise and risk, it helps to look at the individual stories of patients and their families that transform all the hard numbers into real faces.', 'I\'ve heard at least three of these heart-wrenching stories in the past few months. In a Friday piece for the Wall Street Journal by Joseph Walker, FDA Approves World\'s First Crispr Gene-Editing Drug for Sickle-Cell Disease, he highlighted the story of a woman named Marie Tornyenu who had to be hospitalized sometimes and got monthly transfusions of healthy blood from a donor. Walker described how Tornyenu lived in fear of the bouts of extreme pain in her hips and legs that felt like a ""dull ache that just burns and gets exponentially worse.""', 'Knowing some of the forthcoming risks of the necessary chemotherapy, she began receiving Casgevy treatments in a clinical trial in 2021 after undergoing fertility treatment to preserve her eggs in case she wanted to have children in the future. After a few months, she was in a resurggence where not only the pain was gone but also the effecs of chemo.', 'Walker writes...', 'For the first time, she could take a walk around her neighborhood without getting fatigued. ""I still thought about, \'What if I have pain?\'"" said Tornyenu, 22 years old, of Bethlehem, Pa.

The top line came in $48 million, or half a percent, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,646 million.', ""Dollar General's same-store sales fell 1.3% year over year, owing to a lower average transaction amount, partly offset by an increase in customer traffic.

However, sales declined 0.2% to $940.6 million for Seasonal, 7% to $534.5 million for Home Products and 1.5% to $278.5 million for the Apparel category.', 'Gross profit dipped 2.5% to $2,812.5 million in the reported quarter and the gross margin decreased 147 basis points to 29%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to lower inventory markups, increased shrink and higher markdowns, partly offset by a lower LIFO provision and decreased transportation costs.', 'The company has been taking actions to accelerate the pace of inventory-reduction efforts and additional investments in planned areas like retail labor to elevate the in-store experience.', 'For fiscal 2023 (ends January), management now projects net sales growth to be in the band of 1.5-2.5% versus the previous expectation of 1.3-3.3%. This includes a negative impact of about two percentage points owing to the lapping fiscal 2022 53rd week. Same-store sales growth is likely to come in the range of a decline of about 1% to flat against the previous guidance range of a 1% decline to 1% growth.', 'For fiscal 2023, the company now expects earnings per share to be $7.10-$7.60 or a decrease of 29-34% versus the prior expectation of about a 22-34% decline. This view includes the adverse impact of nearly four percentage points owing to higher interest expense.', 'After the report, analysts have taken down sales and profit estimates further, likely keeping DG in the doghouse of the Zacks Rank. Current FY23 consensus is now $7.42, representing a 30.5% annual decline and next year looks to only grow 2% from there.', 'In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Dollar General opened 263 stores, remodeled 545 stores and relocated 44 stores. In fiscal 2024 (begins in February), the company anticipates carrying out 2,385 real estate projects, including 800 store openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 store relocations.', 'The company still sees an opportunity to open about 12,000 more stores in the US over the next several years. But given increased capital and construction costs, the pace is slowing versus the 990 store openings in 2023.', 'After reaching for 3-month highs near $140, DG shares were rejected post-earnings. That will likely prove resistance until next quarter since it was also the site of the last earnings gap down in late August.', ""DG may prove to be a value stock again at some point -- it currently trades at an attractive price/sales ratio of 0.7 on about $40 billion in revenues. But we'll need to see a turnaround in the next quarter or two. The Zacks Rank will let you know."", 'Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the market has witnessed wild swings in oil prices. This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby poising Marathon Petroleum Corp., EOG Resources, Inc. and Phillips 66 for growth.', ""We should not forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak.

The commodity's price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020."", 'However, with the rapid development of vaccines by scientists, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at slightly higher than $70 per barrel and has been volatile on weak China demand concerns amid global supply surplus.', 'Overall, the oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.', 'We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks.

The benchmark has registered the longest streak of weekly gains since November 2019, closing at the highest level since March 2022. The solid trend is likely to continue in 2024, with many analysts turning bullish on the benchmark.The S&P 500 has gained more than 20% so far this year but is shy of 4% from its record high in late 2021. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen about 21% this year. Though most of the stocks in the ETF have returned handsomely, many are undervalued, as reflected in their lower P/E ratio than industry peers. The fund has good potential for the next year. The constituent stocks have a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B or better, suggesting their outperformance in the months to come.These include Everest Group Ltd. EG, Comcast Corporation CMCSA, 3M Company MMM, Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP and DaVita Inc. DVA.According to Bloomberg’s latest Markets Live Pulse survey, a median of 518 respondents expects the S&P 500 to climb to 4,808 points next year, outpacing its previous closing peak of 4,797 hit in January 2022.Fundstrat Tom Lee, who has been one of the most persistently bullish forecasters on Wall Street this year, expects that stocks will surge to a new all-time high in 2024 as the Fed shifts to a less restrictive monetary policy. He anticipates that the S&P 500 could soar to 5,200 by the end of 2024, marking a 13% increase from its current level. This optimism is partly based on the expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year as inflation eases. Rates, which have risen to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, could potentially drop to 3.2%-3.5% (read: What Lies Ahead of S&P 500 ETFs in 2024?).Tom Lee said that narrowing credit spreads and a rally in high-yield bond prices suggest an ongoing liquidity rally. Despite significant withdrawals from stocks this year, cyclical stocks, bank stocks and small-cap stocks have shown an upward trend, indicating that the market is in a state of expansion, supporting the uptrend in equities.Other Wall Street forecasters are also optimistic, with the U.S. avoiding a recession and inflation cooling. Major financial institutions like Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale predict that the S&P 500 could hit new highs in 2024.After the astounding surge of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, the rally has been broadening out in recent weeks. As more underperforming members of the S&P 500 catch up, the index should continue to climb, even if the rise in the Magnificent Seven stalls out. Per a strategist at Bank of America, only about 24% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading within 10% of their all-time highs. This is notably lower than the historical average of 28%.

The proposal, submitted on December 1, 2023, values Macy's at $21 per share, representing a 20% premium from the company's closing price of over $17/share on Friday, December 8, 2023. The offer, if accepted, would involve acquiring the Macy's stock that the investor group does not already own.

These beats were driven by better-than-expected same-store sales performance (analysts forecasted a 7% decline, and Gap posted a 2% decline)."", ""Moreover, the stock's attractiveness is bolstered by a compelling valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of less than 10x and an appealing dividend yield of nearly 5%.

Yet, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore believes that as the inventory correction runs its course over the coming months, the fundamentals for devices are “turning more positive.”', 'However, there’s a catch here. “In a perfect world,” notes the 5-star analyst, “that fundamental bottoming would be aligned with trough valuations.” But that is not the case, says Moore, given semis have bettered the overall market’s performance.', 'So, it’s time to be picky, and here, Moore recommends a “move to an overweight position in devices.” “While we still argue for being selective, the combination of recovering fundamentals and the importance of semiconductors in early stage AI argues for a higher than market weight exposure,” Moore explained. “Generally speaking, barring macro dislocation, we are past the bottom in some areas, and for most others, the bottom is in sight. Barring economic dislocation, things should improve over the course of 2024.”', 'So, with that in mind let’s now take a look at 3 semiconductor stocks Moore considers hot buys right now. We ran the trio through the\xa0TipRanks\xa0database\xa0to see what other\xa0experts make of these choices.', '‘Time to Upgrade,’ Says J.P. Morgan About These 2 Energy Stocks', 'TipRanks’ ‘Perfect 10’ Picks: 2 Top-Scoring Stocks for 2024', 'BMO Optimistic About Fintech Stocks in 2024; Here Are 3 Top Picks to Keep an Eye On', 'Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)', 'First on our list is Qorvo, the North Carolina-based large-cap chip designer and manufacturer that has its hands in all of the leading-edge high-tech markets. Qorvo’s core business, the products that make up the bulk of its output, are top-end radio frequency (RF) and power chipsets that provide solutions in a range of applications, from aerospace/defense to IoT to mobile networking to infrastructure and power management. These are expanding niches, that combine high demand with exacting specifications, requiring quality in execution.', 'Qorvo has been delivering that for the better part of three decades, and in recent years has been moving into 5G technology as well. The company’s 5G-enabled chips can be found in both the new wireless infrastructure and in the newer handsets and devices, where strong execution is required to ensure that the new systems are viable.', 'This company has a world-wide footprint, which exposes it to multiple headwinds – but also provides plenty of strength to offset them. Case in point, Qorvo is facing some pressure in the Chinese markets, where that country’s post-COVID recovery has grown somewhat muted recently. On the positive side, however, Qorvo finds meaningful support from its stable business with the defense industry, and its overall high-quality content story.', 'Looking at Qorvo’s recent financial performance, we find that the last reported quarter, fiscal 2Q24 (September quarter), showed a marked turnaround from the previous three quarters. The nine months ending with June 30 of this year saw a marked reduction in the company’s revenues and earnings, but the quarter ending on September 30 showed a return to higher levels at both the top and bottom lines.', 'In the report for 2Q of fiscal year 2024, Qorvo showed a top line of $1.1 billion, a total that was down 5.2% year-over-year but up 70% from Q1 – and beat the forecast by approximately $100 million. The company had a non-GAAP operating income of $279 million, or $2.39 per share; that EPS figure was 62 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company’s forward guidance for the quarterly ending this month, fiscal 3Q24, is upbeat, predicting revenue of $1 billion (compared to a consensus estimate of $991.8 million) and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.65 at the midpoint (compared to a $1.62 consensus).', 'This forms the background for Moore’s comments on Qorvo. He notes the potential for long-term earnings growth here, writing, “With the momentum from increased Apple share and snapback in China Android, Qorvo has enough GM expansion to get to $10+ EPS by CY2025. The stock currently trades at 10x CY25 EPS, which is on the lower end of their historical range and looks inexpensive given expectations of strong earnings growth. Valuation is going to remain at the lower end of US semis, given long term share pressure from China, high customer concentration, and modest smartphone growth, but from this level there is still material upside…”', 'Bottom-line, Moore bumps the stock’s rating from Equal-weight to Overweight (Buy). His price target, now set at $134 (up from $120), implies an upside of 29% for the year ahead. (To watch Moore’s track record, click here.)', 'Where Moore and Morgan Stanley are bullish, the Street generally is more cautious; the shares have a Hold consensus rating based on 17 recent analyst reviews with a breakdown of 11 Holds, and 3 Buys and Sells, each. The average price target is $102.62, suggesting the shares will stay rangebound for the time being. (See Qorvo’s stock forecast.)', 'Ambarella (AMBA)', 'Next up is Ambarella, a $2.3 billion fabless chip company that lies squarely in the small- to mid-cap category. Ambarella specializes in designing, testing, marketing, and selling its chipsets, producing prototypes and contracting the regular production line runs to dedicated chip foundries. It’s a division-of-labor model that has worked well in the semiconductor industry.', 'On its own end, Ambarella works in the video application niche, creating chipsets that that are optimized for image processing and high-resolution video compression. The company’s products are found in a wide range of digital imaging technologies and systems, from wearable cameras to vehicle dash-cams, to pocket sized digital stills and video cameras to driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicle ‘eyes.’ The common factor among these applications is a need for high definition video at low power – a specialty niche that Ambarella has filled well.', 'This has resulted in a line of chips designed specifically for battery-powered devices, where power consumption is a primary concern. Ambarella’s products are known for outperforming in power efficiency, sometimes by a factor of 5 or more, while continuing to provide superior results in picture clarity and file compression. It all comes down to the proven quality of Ambarella’s low-power systems-on-chip high-quality video and image resolution.', 'Despite the company’s leading role in a growing niche, AMBA shares have lost heavily in the past year. The stock is down approximately 27% in the last 12 months, and earnings have been running negative for several quarters. The decline came as customer firms were working to clear out old inventory, resulting in lower demand for new products. At the end of November, however, Ambarella’s fiscal 3Q24 results (October quarter), while down y/y, beat the forecast at the top and bottom lines.', 'The company’s revenue total was $50.6 million for fiscal Q3, down 39% from the previous year’s quarter but sliding in some $590,000 above expectations. The bottom-line earnings figure came to a loss of 28 cents per share by non-GAAP measures; this was 11 cents per share narrower than had been anticipated.', 'Turning to Moore’s view, we find the analyst setting this stock up as one of his favorite SMID chip firms. Moore is bullish on the risk-reward and the long-term potential to beat the headwinds, saying of the company, “For investors looking for SMID exposure, we continue to prefer AMBA on their long-term risk reward. We see high strategic value in AMBA’s technology over the long term, which we believe will support meaningful upside in the future. However, we do remain cautious near term as they are currently in the middle of a severe inventory correction and are seeing market share pressure in their legacy video. We expect headwinds in their legacy surveillance business to ease next year, and remain positive on the importance of the technology solutions the company provides long term.”', 'Moore rates these shares as Overweight (a Buy), with a $67 price target to point toward a 16% one-year upside potential.', 'This stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 11 recent reviews that include 7 Buys to 3 Holds to 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $57.82 and the average target price of $72.78 implies a gain of 26% on the one-year horizon. (See Ambarella’s stock forecast.)', 'Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI)', 'Last on our list today is Analog Devices, a chip company that holds a solid position in the signal processing and data conversion segment. Analog’s product portfolio includes a wide range of chipsets, used in applications as varied as motor and motion control, power monitoring, clocks and timing devices, amplifiers, switches and multiplexes, and industrial ethernet solutions – and that is only a partial list.', 'Analog’s strategy, avoiding specialization but opting to fill a wide range of applications for its products, has paid off. The company boasts the largest market cap on this list of Morgan Stanley picks – in excess of $91 billion – and realized some $12 billion in sales last year. From an investor perspective, this is a lucrative stock, that has returned $19 billion to shareholders over the past decade.', 'A significant portion of that shareholder return comes from the company’s dividend payment, which was last declared for a December 14 payment. That payment is scheduled at 86 cents per share, or $3.44 annualized. While this gives a forward yield of just 1.86%, it’s important to note that the company has a history of consistent dividend payments and boasts of 19 straight years of dividend growth.', 'In its last quarterly report, covering fiscal Q423 (October quarter), Analog reported a top line revenue total of $2.7 billion; this represented a 16.3% y/y drop but was in-line with analyst expectations. The bottom line, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of $2.01 per share, was a penny below the forecast. The company had an operating cash flow of $4.8 billion, a free cash flow of $3.6 billion, and returned $4.6 billion to shareholders during the fiscal fourth quarter.', 'In his coverage for MS, top analyst Moore points out that ADI shares are a sound choice for investors looking to pick up a resilient stock with a history of outperforming downcycles. He writes, “ADI has outperformed peers in the past 3 downcycles, as gross margin has stayed resilient through cycle, and we expect the company to exhibit gross margin resilience through this current downcycle. The company has relatively higher ASP products which should limit direct competition with emerging Chinese capacity. Their latest earnings gave us further confidence that this current downturn should bottom in Q2 2024: the company has seen sequential improvement in bookings and pointed towards stabilization, cancellations are down meaningfully for the first time in close to a year, and inventory digestion accelerated at their largest customer.”’', 'Moore goes on to put an Overweight (Buy) rating here, along with a $219 price target to imply an 18% gain in the next 12 months.', 'Zooming out a bit, we find that ADI gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Street’s consensus, a view based on 18 calls – 13 to Buy and 5 to Hold. ADI shares are priced at $184.88 and their $200.88 average target price indicates room for a 8.5% one-year upside potential.

If you want to skip all the updates about Bill Gates and want to skip to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Bill Gates Stocks Other Billionaires Are Also Piling Into. ', ""Bill Gates is one of the richest people in the world. His current net worth sits at a whopping $110 billion according to Forbes Magazine, ensuring that Mr. Gates might not run out of money for the rest of his life. The secret to his wealth is identifying the disruptive potential of a graphical user interface (GUI) used to control a computer. Mr. Gates and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s co founder Steve Jobs witnessed GUI in real time, and the rest is history that has seen a mouse or a track pad under everyone's hands."", 'These days, Bill Gates is busy with another revolutionary technology. If, after looking at the stock market in 2022 you decided to relocate under a rock, 2023 has been defined by artificial intelligence. Often thought to be under the domain of science fiction, A.I. systems are now making their way to consumers and companies and have injected stocks of companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with steroids.', ""At the heart of the current A.I. revolution is OpenAI. The San Francisco, California based firm's ChatGPT caught the public imagination after its release, and OpenAI's GPT-4 A.I. model is believed to be one of the most advanced models of its kind in the world. However, before OpenAI became a household name, it was eagerly developing its software and consulting with Mr. Gates. While you might believe A.I. is all hype and no substance, Mr. Gates begs to differ. His first foray with GUIs in 1980 had stunned him into action, and according to him, A.I. is the second time in his life that he has come across such a technology."", ""Don't believe us? Well, take a look at what Mr. Gates wrote in March 2023:"", 'The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface—the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows. I sat with the person who had shown me the demo, a brilliant programmer named Charles Simonyi, and we immediately started brainstorming about all the things we could do with such a user-friendly approach to computing. Charles eventually joined Microsoft, Windows became the backbone of Microsoft, and the thinking we did after that demo helped set the company’s agenda for the next 15 years.', 'The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team from OpenAI since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.', ""Safe to say, if Bill Gates thinks that A.I. in 2023 is the biggest disruptor in the technology industry since the point and click principle of today's operating systems, then there might be more to the technology than A.I.'s biggest detractors believe. However, another individual that has played a key role in today's A.I. wave is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Mr. Musk is one of OpenA's original followers, and after Gates shared in March that A.I. was the second biggest surprise of his career, Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his opinion that Gates' understanding of A.I. was limited back when OpenAI's earliest meetings took place in 2016 and that his knowledge is still limited."", ""Yet, since his retirement from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Gates has been dabbling in a lot more industries apart from A.I. His foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invests in publicly traded companies and awards grants to others that have the potential of solving the world's greatest problems such as hunger, renewable energy, and disease. One such firm that Mr. Gates himself founded is TerraPower. He set up the company in 2008 and still continues to serve as its chairman. TerraPower is a nuclear power company that is developing next generation nuclear reactors that are called traveling wave reactors (TRWs). Conventional nuclear reactors cannot just use uranium that's been mined from the ground. Instead, uranium is enriched first, which creates an entirely new supply chain. TRWs plan to use un-enriched uranium, and TerraPower scored a win at the COP28 conference held in the U.A.E. as the U.A.E.'s state owned nuclear firm ENEC shared that it has signed an MOU with TerraPower to invest the deployment of advanced reactors in the U.A.E. and globally."", ""So, as 2024 comes to a close, seems like Bill Gates can't do anything wrong. Therefore, we thought to take a look at which of his other stock picks are also popular among billionaire investors. Some notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

Since this decade began, the stock market's three major indexes have vacillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions."", ""Despite this volatility, the outlook for the semiconductor industry remains as bright as ever. Although forecasts vary wildly, depending on the source, one relative constant is the expectation that global semiconductor revenue will top $1 trillion, annually, by the turn of the decade. That's a lot of money to be divvied up among dozens of established and promising businesses."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', 'While some semiconductor stocks stand out as phenomenal values given their future growth prospects and competitive advantages, others appear priced for perfection in an imperfect and ever-evolving industry.', 'What follows are two semiconductor stocks that are surefire buys for the new year, as well as one high-flying chip stock investors may want to steer clear of.', ""Shares of central processing unit (CPU) juggernaut Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are higher by nearly 62% on a year-to-date basis through Dec. 8. While it's not the jaw-dropping value it was a year ago, there's plenty of reason for patient investors to be excited about its steady transition to a more diversified and higher-growth operating model."", 'It\'s no secret to anyone who owns shares of Intel or tracks it on their watchlist that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has been ""chipping"" away at its CPU lead. AMD has been successfully siphoning away share in personal computers (PCs) and data centers, which clearly has Wall Street concerned.', ""There also looks to be some skepticism on Wall Street regarding Intel's late entry into the artificial intelligence (AI) arena. Intel laid out plans to debut its Falcon Shores graphics processing unit (GPU) for AI-accelerated data centers in 2025. In the meantime, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPUs have run away with well over 80% of high-compute, data-center market share -- for the time being."", ""Despite skepticism surrounding Intel's near-term outlook, the company's stock looks like a bargain given the growth opportunities that lie ahead."", ""For example, the company's introduction of Falcon Shores by mid-decade should allow Intel to gobble up meaningful share in AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia's growth has predominantly come on the heels of pricing power and GPU scarcity. Even with increased production in the upcoming year, there will be plenty of market share in play for 2025 and beyond. If Falcon Shores can be competitive with AMD's MI300X AI-GPU and Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs, there's no reason it can't snag meaningful share."", ""Additionally, Intel is diversifying its revenue channels by building out its foundry segment. It's spending approximately $20 billion to open two chip-fabrication facilities in Ohio next year, with a third plant set to open in Germany later this decade. By 2030, Intel could grow into the world's No. 2 chip foundry, which would almost certainly lift the company's operating margin."", ""Don't overlook Intel's still-dominant legacy segments, either. While PCs aren't the growth driver they once were, Intel is still the undisputed kingpin in CPUs for PCs and traditional data centers. These segments will remain cash cows for Intel, providing the company with ample cash to grow its foundry segment and invest in high-growth initiatives."", 'The second semiconductor stock that can confidently be bought hand over fist by investors in the new year is Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO).', 'Arguably the biggest knock against Qorvo is the expectation that global-smartphone sales will decline for a third consecutive year to approximately 1.34 billion units, which is a level not seen since 2014. Qorvo, which makes an assortment of wireless solutions, generated around three-quarters of its sales from smartphones/cellular products during its September-ended quarter.', ""Although tepid smartphone demand in 2023 is a tangible concern, there are a handful of reasons to be excited about the company's future."", 'To begin with, I believe the decline in smartphone sales will abate in the coming quarters. The expansion of 5G wireless networks worldwide should lead to a sustained smartphone upgrade cycle. Qorvo is responsible for some of the wireless solutions that make next-generation smartphones tick.', ""To add to the above, Qorvo has a very close working relationship with Apple, the largest smartphone company by market share in the United States. Apple's innovation has endeared generations of consumers to its products. As long as Qorvo components remain a staple in the iPhone, there's no reason to believe the company's bottom line won't grow over time."", ""But the juiciest growth opportunity for Qorvo is liable to come from its ancillary operations. In particular, Qorvo's wireless connectivity and power-management solutions could become staples in next-generation vehicles, including electric vehicles. As developed countries aim to minimize their carbon footprints, this shift to technology-enhanced, cleaner vehicles will be a tailwind for the company."", 'Lastly, Qorvo stock is cheap. Shares are currently trading for less than 14 times forward-year earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) expected to nearly double over the next four years.', 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""However, not all semiconductor stocks are necessarily going to be winners in the new year. The one I'd strongly suggest avoiding like the plague in 2024 is none other than the hottest megacap company on the planet, Nvidia."", ""As noted, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs account for the lion's share of AI-focused GPUs being utilized in high-compute data centers. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia is positioned to command more than 90% of the AI-GPU market in 2024. With Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing increasing its chip on wafer on substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have trouble meeting the needs of more of its enterprise customers moving forward."", ""But it's important to recognize that a lot of Nvidia's AI data-center gains this year were a function of A100 and H100 GPU scarcity and pricing power. Through the midpoint of Nvidia's fiscal year, which began on Jan. 30, 2023, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined as its sales soared. This is a clear indication that scarcity for its in-demand GPUs drove its growth."", ""Normally, strong pricing power is a welcome sight for a business and its investors. But this isn't going to be the case for Nvidia. With its own production ramping up, coupled with the arrival of AMD's MI300X GPU, it'll be considerably easier for businesses to get their hands on AI-accelerated GPUs in 2024 (and beyond). Nvidia will, undoubtedly, move more units, but its gross margin is going to suffer as its pricing power fades."", ""To add, Nvidia is facing regulatory pressure at home. U.S. regulators recently clamped down on AI chip exports to China, which is responsible for around 20% to 25% of the company's annual sales. Though Nvidia did develop less powerful versions of its leading A100 and H100 GPUs for export to the world's No. 2 economy, these restrictions could put a ceiling on Nvidia's near-term growth prospects."", ""History isn't on Nvidia's side, either. Every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has worked its way through an initial bubble phase, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to the rule. By the time Intel enters the arena with Falcon Shores in 2025, the industry will have somewhat matured. However, 2024 could be a difficult year for AI stocks if enterprise GPU demand fails to live up to investors' lofty expectations."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'Where should you invest $1,000 right now?', 'Citigroup is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

The big reason is that the global chip industry is actually going through a cyclical downturn. Despite surging AI demand, demand for chips to power mobile hardware, automobiles, and other key product categories has actually been relatively soft."", ""But it's important to keep the cyclical nature of the chip in mind.

Both potential deals raise questions around the state of streaming services and potential M&A activity heading into 2024. Matthew Harrigan, Benchmark Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to give insights into why he feels both headlines are ""a bit of a surprise,"" though he also notes that it media conglomerates are looking to get ""more scale"" relative to competition from the likes of Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Amazon (AMZN) and others.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Deal activity driving a lot of action in the media space. Some of the big movers in today's session, Paramount Global and Altice. Paramount pulling back from gains last week that Shari Redstone is considering selling a controlling stake in National Amusements, that's the parent of the entertainment giant. Altice under pressure on a CNBC report it may sell cheddar news to a private equity firm."", ""Joining us now is Matthew Harrigan, analyst at Benchmark. So Matthew, thank you so much for joining us. I want to start actually, Matthew, with Paramount, because that's been making a lot of headlines, these reports that the parent company may be sold. Matthew, I know you don't directly cover that name, but just interested to get your general take on those headlines as an analyst who covers the space."", ""MATTHEW HARRIGAN: Sure. I think it's a bit of a surprise. I mean, my colleague, Dan Kurnos, our broadcast analyst, actually follows the name. And I think that they really started or really started to improve operations in a number of regards. I mean, you're above 60 million subscribers now on Paramount Plus to take one instance."", ""And I think it's a little surprising that after everything they've gone through that they'd be willing to sell at what would be probably a heavily discounted price to the sum of the parts valuation. I don't think that's any news. I mean, most of these media conglomerates have traded at very significant discounts, I mean, maybe for 15 or 20 years apart from momentary bubbles."", 'But I think my colleague would be inclined to downplay it somewhat. But I think there is a real imperative to get more scale when you look at the competition relative to not just even Netflix and Disney, but also Amazon and others.', 'JULIE HYMAN: And, Matthew, just more broadly here, when you look at this landscape, it feels like that there is a lot in play in terms of deals and deal activity potentially happening in 2024. Is that what you see? Do you expect an uptick?', ""MATTHEW HARRIGAN: Well, I think the media group is really in kind of perma play. I mean, every year at the [INAUDIBLE] company conference, I think people are always talking. And action can be another matter. I mean, some of the longer-standing deal, deals that people talked about with Viacom and the Paramount Global haven't happened. And then people have been really taken aback by certain surprises."", ""So I think there is an imperative to get more consolidation. I think there's probably some residual antitrust concern, even though it may not be rational for certain businesses. I mean, you may recall that theater deals were very difficult for a number of years because of a Supreme Court ruling going back to 1954. And I think you could probably have a little bit of resistance in Washington to combining broadcast networks and particularly if you combine news operation. You can see what's happening in the UK right now with The Telegraph and Jeff Zucker and potentially Abu Dhabi being supposedly a passive potential investor in concert with Zucker. So I think people are talking certainly. But talking is very-- it's very difficult to satisfy all parties when you look at the valuations right now in traditional media.""]"

Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., last month urged FERC to “to strengthen and swiftly finalize” its proposed rule.', 'On the issue of cost allocation, Whitehoue said a “foundational list of benefits” and a requirement they are used by transmission planners will lead to more efficient transmission planning for regional projects and, ultimately, interregional projects.', '“Absent this, beneficial projects will not be developed, and consumers will suffer,” he said. “FERC must also be prepared to act if states cannot reach agreement on how to best distribute costs.”', 'FERC this summer approved new interconnection rules and acting Chairman Willie Phillips said last month he aims to advance a final transmission planning rule as soon as possible.', 'Potentially helping that effort,\xa0given FERC Commissioner James Danly’s non-participation in recent agency decisions, it appears he will leave the agency when this Congressional session ends in January.\xa0Danly voted against the proposed planning and cost allocation rule.

The benchmark has registered the longest streak of weekly gains since November 2019, closing at the highest level since March 2022. The solid trend is likely to continue in 2024, with many analysts turning bullish on the benchmark.The S&P 500 has gained more than 20% so far this year but is shy of 4% from its record high in late 2021. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen about 21% this year. Though most of the stocks in the ETF have returned handsomely, many are undervalued, as reflected in their lower P/E ratio than industry peers. The fund has good potential for the next year. The constituent stocks have a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B or better, suggesting their outperformance in the months to come.These include Everest Group Ltd. EG, Comcast Corporation CMCSA, 3M Company MMM, Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP and DaVita Inc. DVA.According to Bloomberg’s latest Markets Live Pulse survey, a median of 518 respondents expects the S&P 500 to climb to 4,808 points next year, outpacing its previous closing peak of 4,797 hit in January 2022.Fundstrat Tom Lee, who has been one of the most persistently bullish forecasters on Wall Street this year, expects that stocks will surge to a new all-time high in 2024 as the Fed shifts to a less restrictive monetary policy. He anticipates that the S&P 500 could soar to 5,200 by the end of 2024, marking a 13% increase from its current level. This optimism is partly based on the expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year as inflation eases. Rates, which have risen to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, could potentially drop to 3.2%-3.5% (read: What Lies Ahead of S&P 500 ETFs in 2024?).Tom Lee said that narrowing credit spreads and a rally in high-yield bond prices suggest an ongoing liquidity rally. Despite significant withdrawals from stocks this year, cyclical stocks, bank stocks and small-cap stocks have shown an upward trend, indicating that the market is in a state of expansion, supporting the uptrend in equities.Other Wall Street forecasters are also optimistic, with the U.S. avoiding a recession and inflation cooling. Major financial institutions like Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale predict that the S&P 500 could hit new highs in 2024.After the astounding surge of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, the rally has been broadening out in recent weeks. As more underperforming members of the S&P 500 catch up, the index should continue to climb, even if the rise in the Magnificent Seven stalls out. Per a strategist at Bank of America, only about 24% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading within 10% of their all-time highs. This is notably lower than the historical average of 28%. This suggests that many stocks in the index may be undervalued and have the potential to rise toward their peak values.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.', 'SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.3% of the assets.

Various sectors experienced contrasting outcomes, influenced by ongoing political and economic factors. The energy sector in the US maintained stability throughout 2022, largely attributed to elevated prices and limited supplies. Closing the year with remarkable growth, it surged by 58% by December 30, a stark contrast to the S&P 500's approximately 20% decline. Notably, according to Dow Jones Market Data, this marked the first instance of the energy sector standing out as the sole victor in the S&P 500 annual performance, and it was the only sector that didn't witness a decline throughout the year. This year, the situation has reversed, as energy stocks are now trailing behind the overall market performance. The S&P 500 Energy is down by 7.31% in 2023 so far, compared with a 20.40% gain of the S&P 500."", 'In addition to this, the largest American exchange-traded fund (ETF) that follows clean energy stocks was set to mark its highest yearly outflows ever due to several factors. Rapidly increasing interest rates, rising prices of raw materials, and disruptions in the supply chain have diminished the appeal of this fund for investors. As per Lipper data, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF has recorded more than $1 billion in net outflows as of November 2023. This ETF, which was once favored during the pandemic, had experienced substantial net inflows of over $2 billion annually in both 2020 and 2021. However, investors have been pulling out of this ETF amid the escalation of interest rates. Moreover, more investors are heavily invested in technology stocks compared to energy stocks than they have been since September 2021, according to a Bank of America survey. The report mentioned that the managers have allocated the least amount of money to energy shares since December 2020.', ""Despite a recent slowdown, energy stocks have proven advantageous for investors over the past three years, soaring by more than 200%. This growth aligned with the rise in oil prices from their low points over multiple years. These years serve as a valuable lesson for investors, illustrating the correlation between energy stock performance and substantial fluctuations in oil prices. Moreover, the energy sector has changed notably, with many companies allocating more funds to dividends for investors while cutting back on new drilling. This shift has reshaped how energy investments work, underscoring these companies' evolving strategies focused on boosting returns for shareholders."", ""Analysts are also positive about the sector’s outlook. Todd\xa0 Sohn, a managing director in ETF and technical strategy, mentioned in an interview that there's a slight improvement in energy's performance despite the outflows. This doesn't stand as a clear signal on its own, but it hints at a positive change in sentiment. He suggests that this situation could now be seen as an opportunity for a contrarian move. Investors are attracted to energy companies because their stock prices are relatively low compared to some of the major technology stocks that drove the market's growth this year. They're seeking to expand their investments beyond the dominant tech stocks and see potential in the energy sector."", 'Another reason for investors’ inclination toward energy stocks is their commitment to shareholder return. Over the years, energy companies have maintained a practice of sharing profits with shareholders in the form of dividends, making their stocks attractive for income-focused investors. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best dividend stocks from the energy sector.

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, Cloud Services and License Support is now 74% of the revenue, and its recurring revenue and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen and it's happening. And as this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year. To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just 3 years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we kept talking about it, and we knew it was only a matter of time. And now more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services. Our financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads, given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle cloud infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things, creating the second-generation cloud enabled us to building much better, more scalable and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently. Second, we know what it takes to run an enterprise scale, performance and security better than, I'd say, anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission-critical systems. Third, we recognized that customers need deployment flexibility. Rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated Cloud at Customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds and Alloy, our partner cloud. And then finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry-changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out with total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and EPS at the high end of guidance. Now as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance 3 months ago. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50% and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud application, autonomous database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and were up 19%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which include License Support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 infrastructure Cloud Services revenue grew 55% with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40% and autonomous database up 26%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4%, including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner. Now shifting to margins. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 78%. This is because of the mix between Support and Cloud, in which Cloud is growing much faster than Support, Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. While we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To this point, the gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year. The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34 in USD, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89 in USD. At quarter end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last 4 quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%, and free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to see cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity. To that point, we now have 66 customer-facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world and another 6 being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure. We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, 9 national security regions and 2 EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we have 7 Alloy cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. And of course, we also have so many, many, many Cloud at Customer installations. The sizing and flexibility -- the sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantageous for us in the marketplace. And finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. And in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different. So because of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Total revenues, excluding Cerner, are expected to grow from 8% to 10%. Total cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 26% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Thank you, Safra. The demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and generative AI is consistently increasing quarter after quarter. Oracle's total remaining performance obligations, or RPO, has now reached $65 billion, slightly more than our annual revenue. In response to the sharply increasing demand, Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud data centers and building 100 new cloud data centers. We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply. Cloud infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate. In the next few weeks, we expect to sign a couple more billion-dollar cloud infrastructure contracts. Gartner recently named Oracle OCI as a leader in cloud platform and infrastructure services. The demand for cloud infrastructure services and new Oracle Cloud data centers is broad-based, driven not only by generative AI customers but also by nation states buying software and Oracle cloud data centers, plus large banks, telecommunications companies, and industrial companies buying dedicated cloud data centers, dedicated Oracle Cloud data centers. And perhaps most interestingly, demand from other hyperscalers and other cloud service providers co-locating and connecting their clouds with Oracle Cloud data centers. Customers don't want clouds to be walled gardens. In the next few months, we will turn on 20 new Oracle Cloud data centers co-located with and connected to Microsoft Azure as a part of our joint multi-cloud initiative. These 20 new multi-cloud data centers will house over 2,000 full racks of Exadata database machines designed to meet pent-up demand for the Oracle Cloud database. We are able to build new data centers rapidly and operate them inexpensively because all of our data centers are architecturally identical, highly automated with an identical high-performance RDMA network, autonomous services and applications. Oracle Cloud data centers vary only by scale. Again, several nation states have ordered multiple sovereign data centers to be built within their country so that they can move their government, health care and commercial workloads to the Oracle Cloud. These new countries include Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and others. Some of the world's largest banks, telecommunications and industrial companies have also contracted with us to build Oracle Cloud data centers dedicated entirely to them so that they can migrate their workloads to an Oracle Cloud data center. These companies include Nomura, Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile, Saudi Telecom, a huge Korean conglomerate and a huge U.S. defense contractor. These are but a few examples that demonstrate the diversity of the growing demand for Oracle's highly differentiated Gen2 cloud infrastructure and data center technology.

Frankly, the only limiting factor is our ability to get the data centers, hand it over and filled up fast enough. This quarter alone, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that we would have been able to recognize if our capacity was available. So the reality is, as we roll out and we've got just so many moving parts, as you can hear from us, we have a lot of capacity coming online.And as you can see in my CapEx guidance, we expect OCI to just grow astronomically, frankly. It is the ideal infrastructure for so much use and, of course, also as more GPUs become available and we can put those in, we have just a really unlimited amount of demand. Larry, I don't know if you want to say anything else?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes. Well, again, in the next few weeks, I mentioned we're going to sign 2 additional contracts right around $1 billion each. I mean, the backlog is growing astronomically. I think it's the word Safra used and that's accurate. There's no reason why -- OCI grew 50% this quarter. I think OCI is going to get much bigger and actually, the growth rate will be above 50%, I believe, as these data centers come online.We think we can build a lot of these data centers very quickly. By the way, again, I emphasize it's not just gen AI demand. There's huge pent up data -- of Cloud database demand. There is huge demand overseas for sovereign clouds where people -- governments haven't been able to move their workloads and a lot of those are government Oracle workloads. They haven't been able to move their workloads to the cloud. I mean, there are literally, I don't know, 5, 6, 7 large companies in Japan that will be building at least 2 data centers, Oracle data centers each. So again, the demand is extraordinary. We can build the data centers relatively fast, and I expect the OCI growth rate to be over 50% for a few years."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes, we're not demand-limited in any way right now."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim.', 'John Stephen DiFucci', ""So since Ben asked about the growth, and maybe I'll take a step back on the other part of all this and that's the profit side, per Larry's comments, you're building out a lot of capacity and Safra's comments with the CapEx growth. But Clay has also spoken about the time it takes to build out hose AI super clusters, and I know that's not the only AI workloads you're doing, but that sounds like some pretty exciting stuff.And it takes time before you get revenue. I realize you're also seeing ramp-up of those, what I'll call, core OCI deals like Uber, and you actually get revenue from them over time. But how should we think about cloud gross margins over time in this context with both those things? A lot happening here."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes, and I'm really glad you asked. I'm really glad you asked because one of the lines that we show you, even though I'd give you more detail is, I show you a number that is a mix of Cloud and Support. And obviously, Support is extremely profitable because of the structure of the way it works and because we are at such a large scale.But the reality is that our cloud businesses are also very profitable. Our SaaS cloud business is very profitable. And our IaaS, our OCI business is improving profitability as it grows. And so the target gross margins for it are much higher than I think you expect because you're probably comparing it to some of the more pure-play cloud folks who somehow don't end up making as much money in all of this. As we grow, our gross margin percentage goes up.So yes, we make a lot of investments and we'll be making a lot of investments, but our profitability continues to go up because once the worst moment is at the moment where the data center is full of computers and you don't have any tenants that first day, but that's not actually how we work. Yes, we have the floor space but we grow in pieces, unlike some of the others that they have to do a full-out build out and put everything there before they have a penny of revenue. That's not how we work.And more and more of our -- so we start small and build up, and that allows us to match our spending with the revenues much better. And that's because we have that engineering deployment flexibility that the first-generation folks don't have. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes, I do. I think 1 thing is very important. We're much more highly automated than the older data centers. So to give you an idea, Oracle Cloud, to run Oracle Cloud, we have to keep track of all of our customers, how much they're using. We have to have a variety of databases and applications that run the cloud. Those databases are all the autonomous databases. We have no labor associated with those databases. It's all completely automated.Our installations, when we bring up a new cloud, you plug it in and the process of bringing it up is largely automated. There aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to bring it up, and there are -- certainly aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to run it every day. We focus on autonomous services. Our Linux, our operating system, is fully autonomous. There's no labor associated with running it. There's certainly labor associated with building the software but not running the software. It doesn't cost us more to run 100 data centers than it cost us to run 10 in terms of data -- DBAs or people running Oracle Autonomous Linux.So we have a very different model than our old data centers or our competitors' data centers. We can run these things. We can bring them up relatively quickly, and we can run them very inexpensively and efficiently. One last thing about being autonomous, the fact that it's automated, there are far fewer errors and there are far fewer security vulnerabilities because the system is completely self-driving."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', 'If I might, Safra, go back to something you said. Is it fair to assume that OCI gross margins have consistently grown over time quarter to quarter?', 'Safra Ada Catz', 'Yes.', 'John Stephen DiFucci', 'Okay, and then...', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""It's grown a lot."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', ""Grown a lot, okay. And then finally, the -- what Larry just said about the database, Safra, I've heard you say at times, we're at the beginning of the beginning of the transition of the database to cloud. So I know you have database in the cloud today but that migration of the on-prem, that's still to come pretty much?"", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes, it is really still to come. It is -- we're talking about tens of billions of dollars when it comes over. So we -- it's starting to come but we haven't been in the place to receive it all en masse. And customers have to get comfortable with it, and also multi-cloud has to really roll out and that's going to be another piece of it. So customers are going to have so many excellent choices. They can go in the public cloud, they can go in OCI. They can go in their cloud customer. They can go in OCI at Azure is 1 possibility.So there's just -- it is the absolute beginning because remember, the Oracle database is not a toy. It's a mission-critical system. If it just disappeared at companies, the whole planet would come to a standstill. And so this is coming and it's just the beginning. So you see what's going on with OCI. No one believed us this was possible. Now here we're at and then right behind it is going to come the database. And that's going to be something."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', ""And for Larry's comments, and I'll stop talking, but for Larry's comments, the database gross margins, given the autonomous nature of it, we should expect that to be different than the OCI core infrastructure-as-a-service gross margin?"", 'Safra Ada Catz', 'Yes, absolutely.', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes, the autonomous -- I don't want to go into detail, but the autonomous database is one, autonomous. There's no labor associated with it. But it's also the only database that's fully elastic. In other words, if you're not using it, no one's using it. I mean, there are no cores, there's no cores occupied. It goes back into the pool. So if you as a customer aren't doing something with the database, literally no cores are occupied. It's very different than an Amazon database where you allocate.I always need 64 cores or 64 processors to run my database, and that's 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. We only charge you for what you use when you're using it. We only consume and -- what you use when you're using it. Otherwise, it goes to other customers. It's totally different. That allows us to have dramatically higher gross margins."", 'John Stephen DiFucci', 'Sorry for the several-part question, but thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.', 'Mark L. Moerdler', ""I want to change gears a little bit and turn to Cerner, which people don't really focus on that much. Cerner license revenue has been down likely in preparation for customers shifting to SaaS. But Oracle doesn't yet have a full multitenant, scalable Cerner SaaS solution. So what I'd like to ask is a couple of parts. How should we think about the timing of, one, the availability of -- yes?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""That's not correct, so Cerner has several pieces. And I believe about half of the customers will be moved -- half of the Millennium customers. You can think of Cerner as just automating hospitals like Epic. And that's a product called Millennium, and about half of those customers will move to OCI by February. Half of all existing customers will be in Oracle OCI.But we've also developed something that began at Cerner and we have finished. Now we completely rewritten it -- well, we're in the process, we will finish next calendar year. But it is largely rewritten and available right now, something called our Health and Data Intelligence Platform. And it was known as Cerner as HealtheIntent and that's for public health. That's for population-scale, public health management. Again, if it's sold to U.S. states. It's sold to Australian states. It's sold to European countries. It's for managing population health.Remember during COVID, when we didn't know New York thought they were running out of hospital rooms but they really weren't but no one knew because no one kept track of our inventory of hospital rooms. There's no national view. No one knew how many people contracted COVID yesterday. We didn't have that national view. We have that national view. It is fully SaaS and it is available right now. So some of the pieces -- some of the Cerner pieces are coming online. Other Cerner pieces are moving more gradually, but they're all going into OCI, and they're all very quickly moving from a license basis to a subscription basis."", 'Mark L. Moerdler', ""So that's very helpful. So that starts to answer the question I was asking was how should we think about the timing of the transition? Millennium, you're saying, is going to be in OCI. Is that going to be a fully SaaS version? When will the rest of the solutions be fully SaaS? And how should we think about the revenue lift as the license and maintenance moves to the cloud -- to SaaS?"", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""So it will be fully in OCI and SaaS but it will not be the new -- we are rewriting -- we're replacing Millennium a piece at a time, not a big lift in shift, but we are upgrading and modernizing Millennium a piece at a time and different pieces will be available starting next year. And so Cerner customers will be getting new features and capabilities as a part of a Millennium -- as Millennium moves to OCI. And again, half the customers will be in OCI by February.So we're making a lot of progress. At the same time, we're adding a lot of new products to Millennium, like the public health products. But we're also adding much of new products for pharmaceutical companies. We're adding additional products for hospitals to keep track of their inventory, for hospitals to manage their workforce. Really, what we think of as our health division in Oracle has products for the entire health care ecosystems, payers, including governments, including insurance companies, providers, including ambulatory clinics and hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, research companies and public health departments, national governments and state governments.So we are -- we have products for the entire health care ecosystem which is a much larger footprint than Cerner ever had. So we are going after a much larger market than Cerner was. So we expect Cerner to be a growth story, I guess that's what I'm getting at."", 'Mark L. Moerdler', ""Great. That's where I'm going with the question."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes. So let me just tell you, I think for the year -- for the full fiscal year, Cerner will be sort of negative 1 to 2 points but that will be it. It will end this fiscal year. And from then on, it will be a growth story. So it will no longer be a drag on Oracle's growth, okay?"", 'Mark L. Moerdler', 'Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. That was very helpful.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.', 'Sitikantha Panigrahi', 'Larry and Safra, many mission-critical workloads still run an Oracle database and you have a sticky maintenance revenue stream. And we expect Oracle will start migrating those database workloads to OCI, which will bring 3x revenue uplift, which you call in the third leg of cloud growth. You also have now OCI inside Azure data center.So my question is, how does this being multi-cloud change your outlook for Oracle database? And what are you hearing from your database customer in terms of their comfort and preparedness to move their Oracle databases to the cloud, either OCI or Azure?', 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Larry, why don't you start with this? No, yes, I do. You go."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Okay. Our customers are very happy with the idea. Remember, Oracle started as one of the first databases that ran everywhere. We ran on IBM mainframes. We ran on personal computers. We ran on digital equipment, if you remember them, many computers. And HP mini computers. We ran on every operating system on every computer.Now in cloud, they're very happy to see that they can not only get the Oracle database at OCI, they can also get the identical capability from Microsoft. Microsoft, we are building data centers for Microsoft inside Azure. And Microsoft, it wasn't us that decided 2,000 was the right number of Exadata machines to install in those 20 data centers. That was Microsoft. The demand is enormous. They want the same -- plus our customers want the same flexibility they've always had with Oracle. They want to use Oracle, they want to transition. But if they're using the Microsoft cloud, they want to run the best and latest and greatest version of Oracle in the Microsoft Cloud.They want to do that in other clouds as well. Some of them is very important to have it. In Japan, for example, it's very important for some of that data remaining in Japan. One of the things the Oracle database does is it runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And it does that in a dedicated data center run by Nomura Research who supplies financial services and Oracle Cloud, Oracle Gen2 Cloud Services to the Japanese market. There are a number of other partners in Japan that are going in that same direction.So they used to -- in Japan, they used to buy the Oracle database from Nomura or they used to buy it from Fujitsu or they bought it from Hitachi or they bought it from NEC. They wanted that Oracle database. It is quite natural for all of those companies to build their own -- have their own dedicated regions of OCI and sell to their -- and support their customers out of those regions. That's the flexibility we allow that something that nobody else can do. We can build these regions for our partners. We can build these regions for sovereign states. We can build these regions for large companies that want to have -- that don't want their data commingled with anyone else's.They want a public cloud. They want a full OCI. They want every part of OCI, but they don't want anyone else in that -- in their region. They want it to be theirs and theirs alone. We can do that. Nobody else can."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line...', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Let me summarize. That means literally any way you want to get Oracle, any way you want to get Oracle, you will be able to get it. It will be a little bit back to the future. And we think the impact on demand -- on database demand, we're seeing it already. Let me close with 2,000 Exadata reps. That's a stunning number in terms of how many customers you could put on that. That's tens of thousands of customers you can put on that much hardware. And that's Microsoft alone, okay."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.', 'Aleksandr J. Zukin', ""I wanted to ask around some of the gen AI functionality inside of the applications portfolio, specifically Fusion and NetSuite. Any update or uptick that you're seeing or can share around some of your partnerships around Cohere? Maybe any early feedback from the field that informs incremental value capture, whether or not it's starting to resonate either in the form of increased migration activity, increased market share gains or increased monetization opportunities around the application portfolio."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Yes. Well, we're using it every place. Perhaps the most stunning is our new -- again, I mentioned at Cerner earlier that we're doing a lot of things that Cerner never did in what is now called Oracle Health. One of those things is our new telecommunications module summarizes a consultation between a doctor and a patient and writes the doctor's notes for the doctor automatically. In fact, for the first time, we've done it. We now have our large language model generating the summary without a scribe, but the doctor can edit in a couple of minutes. So it's actually succeeded in doing one of the very hardest tasks we assigned it.And of course, we're using it in everything from as simple as doing product descriptions or job descriptions, all of those, you've read about all of those. We've actually got those implemented, are delivering those to customers. But even in some of the most challenging areas, in drug design. We're having success with pharmaceutical companies. But with -- actually writing the doctor's notes without a scribe has shocked a great many people. And well, another area, in terms of diagnosing cancer from biopsy, just biopsy images, being able to do that very, very quickly where the patient knows weeks sooner than they would otherwise -- that they get the news weeks sooner from the -- just maybe AI processing the biopsy image, they find out weeks sooner or whether they have to go on chemotherapy or whether they're cancer-free.And we're doing that with an Israeli partner called Imagene. So no, we're seeing a huge uptake of this technology, everything from complex health care and health science to more mundane tasks that you find throughout an enterprise that's still very important in making your employees and your company more efficient and more competitive."", 'Aleksandr J. Zukin', 'Got it. And then from a monetization standpoint, do you -- is this monetizing in a Copilot way similar to Microsoft? Or how do you envision ultimately seeing some of the incremental value captured inside of the model?', 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Well, we think inside of our -- we're -- remember, we're a little bit different than Microsoft. We have a lot more enterprise applications, for example, in health care in -- we run clinical trials. We run hospitals. We run the ambulatory clinics. We run -- we have diagnostic databases for image [costing] databases, conventional blood testing databases, all of those. So our monetization is really at the highest end of the value chain, which is we actually supply the application with our partner that does cancer diagnosis, that does the doctor's notes, that does the doctor's orders, that actually automatically generates the prescriptions, that reminds the patient to take the subscription so you get compliance.Right now without -- I don't want -- I can't spend too much on it. Right now, doctors don't know if patients have refilled their prescriptions. The doctors aren't notified and the patients aren't notified. Reminding them. We're doing all of that. We're doing a bunch of things with -- and that's the high value end of AI, when you're preventing someone from being rehospitalized, which has a huge cost in terms of human suffering and money."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Now we have multiple ways, by the way, to monetize it not only as part of our application but also as part of our infrastructure because one of the unique capabilities we allow is for customers, when they use our product, to basically use their private data in some of these models to -- for them to learn but then to ultimately keep control of their data. And this is applicable in many, many different types of applications and this is a service we provide in addition. So there's just a lot..."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Safra's making a very good point in that we have our own applications in health care, but we have partners and other companies that come to us to use our AI to enrich their applications. And we keep their data private and allow them to enrich their applications. That company I mentioned earlier, Imagene, that's not our application that does the cancer diagnosis. That's an Israeli company that's doing that, but they're using our AI to develop their health care application. So in the -- and their -- so we monetize through Imagene, enabling them to build their AI application, and we also build a lot of our own. So of course, Safra is right. It's a combination of the 2."", 'Operator', 'Your last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.', 'Brad Alan Zelnick', ""Larry, it's taken Oracle several years to reach 66 cloud data centers, and you're now talking about plans to build 100 new ones, which frankly seems very ambitious. What is it that you're seeing that maybe we don't see? And then related perhaps, Safra, if you can speak to the capital requirements and time frame for that, especially in light of CapEx this quarter that was a bit less than we had expected."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Well, okay. How about Microsoft puts an order for 20 -- in an order for 20 cloud data centers? That's what we're seeing. When 1 company -- as you say, we have 60. By the way, that's a little bit -- that's not quite right. I mean, we have 66 cloud regions and we sometimes use those synonymously. They're not always -- they don't -- a data center and region don't necessarily translate 1:1.But the -- yes, when someone comes along and orders 20, then that creates a lot of opportunity for us to build more data centers and get more OCI customers because we're building OCI data centers inside of Azure Cloud. So those are the things we're seeing. We're building our own public regions based on direct customer demand. And then we're building partner regions like the 20 data centers from Microsoft. The combination of the 2 adds up to 100."", 'Safra Ada Catz', ""Yes. And also, one of the things is in that number, it doesn't include the many, many Cloud at Customers which started small and now companies have decided they want their own region. So they had a Cloud at Customer, which is smaller and they decided, no, no, no. Now I want a dedicated region of my own. I get it. This is working. I've saved millions, tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions. Now I want my own.Also, really the -- it is absolutely true. We did not bring up as much capacity as we could have used this past quarter because we had to make some audible calls on the field to decide how to allocate whether to build something small, which was available, which I could have recognized revenue in right in the quarter, or instead to go much bigger and to wait until some larger capacity was going to be available to hand over to me.So as I think I've hinted and we're talking about demand, had we had capacity this quarter in the hundreds of millions of dollars more that was just sitting there waiting to take it, and we have made some deployment choices because we need more and we need it bigger. Instead of taking small pieces or smaller pieces, we decided to focus on the bigger parts and tried to also treat our customers fairly and work with them to meet their needs."", 'Lawrence J. Ellison', ""Let me give you 1 example of that, what Safra is describing is we got enough NVIDIA GPUs for Elon Musk's company, xAI, to bring up the first version, the first available version of their large language model called Grok. They got that up and running. But boy, did they want a lot more. Boy, did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them. We gave them quite a few but they wanted more, and we are in the process of getting them more.So the demand, we got that up pretty quickly. They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more as there's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model. And we are doing our best to keep -- give our customers what we can this quarter and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter."", 'Ken Bond', ""Okay. Thank you, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today.

The survey, which explored consumers’ trust and understanding of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and how it is used by financial services providers, revealed that despite the growing number of use cases from leading technology companies, over 71% of American respondents agree that GenAI makes them nervous.', 'GenAI is a form of artificial intelligence designed to create new content—such as text, images and code—based on provided input or prompts. It has captured the world’s attention over the past 18 months with widely perceived potential to transform how we live and work.

Moreover, 86% of consumers mentioned the need for transparency about how GenAI has access to and uses their private data to trust its use. Other factors that will increase trust in the use of GenAI were having a human overseeing the technology (85%) and the reputation of the brand offering the technology (79%)."", 'Issues of bias are another factor for financial services providers to overcome. Among U.S. consumers, nearly half of respondents are concerned about the accuracy and fairness of these systems due to the potential for gender (48%) and racial biases (49%).

Notably, 70% of Millennials are comfortable with GenAI selecting a credit card for them, compared to only 47% of Boomers.', '""It’s no surprise that GenAI has captured the imagination of Americans—and the world—with its ability to produce near human-like texts as well as surprising and often funny images.

""Transparency, human oversight, and regulation are going to be critical to bridging the GenAI trust gap, which is necessary for any significant adoption of these technologies by financial services providers. Some of this comes to the new-ness of GenAI, but the organizations interested in deploying AI-power services and solutions will need to be proactive communicators to ensure their consumers of its security and benefits.

A minimum of 4,000 offers are available, per the release, with a limit of one offer per person.', 'The doormat concept could help Pizza Hut strengthen relationships with existing customers and drive repeat business.

For instance, the brand tested “Underground Deliveries” in New York City earlier this year as part of a campaign around the release of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.” For the effort, select consumers who texted a turtle emoji to a hotline were able to order pizza delivery to a Pizza Drop Zone within a subway station. Prior, the brand has experimented with the metaverse and set off on an experiential bus tour across multiple states.', 'The chain’s parent company Yum Brands at the start of November filed its Q3 earnings, reporting revenue that fell short of analysts expectations due partially to weak same-store sales growth at Pizza Hut.

Given that it's found a winning formula for gaining and retaining customers, it's difficult to doubt the coffee company will get there soon enough."", 'The kicker: Incoming CEO Christine Barone is a former Starbucks executive. She obviously knows a thing or two about the business.', 'Investors keeping tabs on Dutch Bros likely already know fast food giant McDonald\'s (NYSE: MCD) just unveiled a new restaurant brand that could prove problematic for Dutch Bros\' plans. Specifically, McDonald\'s is testing the waters of a ""beverage-led concept"" called CosMc\'s that\'s ""rooted in beverage exploration, with bold and unexpected flavor combinations, vibrant colors and functional boosts.""', ""It's a bit of a stretch to say McDonald's completely ripped off Dutch Bros' menu full of chilled and frozen drinks or coffee-based treats. Dutch Bros didn't exactly invent the goods it sells either. It's also a stretch to suggest CosMc's will truly be a threat to Dutch Bros anytime soon, if ever. After all, only one such store is up and running right now, with only about 10 more to be established by the end of 2024."", 'It would be short-sighted, however, to not also point out the stark parallels between the two brands. In addition to the menu itself, ""CosMc\'s blazes its own path with a uniquely seamless digital and drive-thru experience"" so customers can ""breeze through the ordering and payment process."" It seems eerily familiar.', ""Still, it's not a problem simply because McDonald's Corp. will likely struggle to replicate the human touch that Dutch Bros' drive-thru stands are known for."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""See, McDonald's deliberately designs stores and establishes training standards so consumers' dining experiences at any of its restaurants are more or less the same; it probably intends to do the same with CosMc's. That's not necessarily what consumers want, though. Again, its customers like that Dutch Bros' stores each seem to have their own personality."", ""Moreover, the fact that McDonald's is entering this new territory may actually be a bullish sign for Dutch Bros. Think about it."", ""McDonald's has mastered the art and science of selling fast food. Even if CosMc's is more of an experiment than a growth initiative at this point, that it's spending time and money to conduct an experiment in the customized and premium beverage space speaks volumes about the market opportunity it sees on this front."", 'And it\'s not the only name making such a move on this quickly developing sliver of the drive-thru market. Smaller outfits, like Scooter\'s, Jamba, Swig, Ellianos, and 7 Brew, are just some of the other players looking to capitalize on the fast-growing demand for quality beverages sold via drive-thrus. Even Starbucks is responding after three-fourths of its third-quarter sales came from its cold-drink category, prompting the rollout of cold foam blenders, ""one of the fastest rollouts [of new equipment] in our history.""', ""Dutch Bros, however, is arguably the only such player with the size, strength, skill, and culture to fully capitalize on this category's growth."", ""While its backstory and potential upside are tasty, Dutch Bros still isn't the right pick for everyone's portfolio. Though profitable, it's a young company and is shelling out quite a bit of cash on its expansion efforts. The stock's also relatively young, only issued via the company's public offering in September 2021. Shares may still be shrugging off the usual post-IPO (initial public offering) impact."", ""If you can deal with the likely volatility and keep your eyes on the longer-term prize, however, it wouldn't be crazy to take a shot on Dutch Bros while the stock's still down."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', 'The $16,728 Social Security Bonus You Cannot Afford to Miss', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'James Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index is down 5% year to date, compared to the broader index’s 20% gain.', ""On the other hand, the game-changing drugs, also known as GLP-1s, have propelled Novo Nordisk to become one of Europe’s most valuable companies. On Monday, the drugmaker was named Yahoo Finance's 2023 Company of the Year,\xa0after its stock clocked a 41% gain on the year."", 'But the initial panic surrounding food stocks is likely unwarranted, according to several sources Yahoo Finance talked to, including Novo Nordisk’s CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen.', '""It\'s really fascinating for us to reflect on how big an impact we might have,"" Jørgensen told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview.', '""There\'s no doubt that with the intervention we see now with the GLP-1 medicines, you see [there\'s a] significant shift in consumer behavior ... some of these categories will be impacted,"" Jorgensen added.', 'Categories he mentioned include medical technology companies and drink and snack businesses, among others, all of which are estimated to see slower revenue growth due to rising GLP-1 use.', 'However, the impact will happen ""over many years,"" as the drug becomes more widely available, per Jørgensen. Currently, a lack of insurance coverage and a supply shortage have limited the adoption of Ozempic and Wegovy.', 'Noise surrounding obesity drugs ramped up over the summer and reached a fever pitch in the fall, as Wall Street salivated at the prospect of a new $100 billion market.', 'Yet as investors take some time to reflect, many are realizing the initial fears of the drugs’ disruption of business are ""overblown,"" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone.', '""The market is starting to realize ... this is not having a material impact on food consumption today,"" Sundaram said. ""This is going to be a long-term trend ... [It\'s] not just going to be a 2023-2024 phenomenon, this is probably going to go on for the next decade. There\'s a lot of time for companies to react and adapt to changing spending environments.”', 'Food companies have weathered numerous dieting trends — think Atkins, Keto, Paleo, Whole30, and South Beach — and many have moved towards offering healthier and more diverse options in recent years.', 'To underscore the point, sales of dry goods are up 7.6% in the past 12 months, while frozen prepared foods are up 5.8%, according to data from NielsenIQ. McDonald’s, long synonymous with greasy burgers, clocked an 8.1% gain for same-store sales in its Q3 results and is planning a record restaurant expansion despite weight-loss drug proliferation.', 'However, decreased appetite and cravings could change people’s snacking habits and create an impact on fast food.', 'Brands that generate substantial sales from snackers or aren’t associated with mealtime — such as Jack in the Box (JACK), Yum! Brands-owned Taco Bell (YUM), Dutch Bros (BROS), and Starbucks (SBUX) — could one day feel the hit.', '""If you\'re on one of these drugs, it\'s much easier to make a decision not to pick up your dollar soda and fries at two in the afternoon or not to eat some of these more fried foods at lunch,"" said Stifel analyst Chris O\'Cull.', ""Restaurant chains like Olive Garden (DRI), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), or Chili’s (EAT) are less exposed, as people taking the drugs are still likely to go out with their friends, said O'Cull."", 'Meanwhile, Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop believes ""the impact is going to be financially immaterial"" on fast food companies, as they have bigger fish to fry in 2024, including a pullback in consumer spending and declining foot traffic.', 'Morningstar estimates that by 2030, 3.5% of the US population will be taking GLP-1s. Even in a “bull case scenario” where 7% of the population is on weight-loss drugs and assuming that calorie intake for patients drops by 30%, it still only translates to a roughly 2.1% impact on same-store sales across the restaurant industry.', 'Such results are ""hardly enough to justify sweeping concerns"" regarding fast food’s future, Dunlop said. More health-conscious brands, like many fast-casual chains, may end up benefiting.', '""Names like Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen would be proportionately better positioned,"" he told Yahoo Finance.', 'Persistent demand for the drugs could bring more consumers into retailers that have pharmacies, per Sundaram.', 'This spells good news for Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), and Costco (COST).', 'The influx of ""healthier"" shoppers picking up their prescriptions could provide a boost to other departments, including ""the food department, apparel department, other general merchandise departments,"" Sundaram added.', 'Kroger Health president Colleen Lindholz told Yahoo Finance she believes the actual impact from the drugs will not be a reduction in food purchases but rather a shift to healthier foods.', '""It just makes sense that people are going to trade up to fresh foods, things that are better for them, because they\'re feeling good about themselves and they\'re feeling good about being healthy overall,"" Lindholz said.', ""But packaged foods like canned soup or chips likely won't be impacted in the near future, experts contend.\xa0Many executives have said there has been no evidence of a change in behavior amid the early adoption of the drugs."", 'PepsiCo (PEP) reported a record third quarter, and CEO Ramon Laguarta said that ""the impact is negligible in our business"" on a call with investors.

He purchased his first stock at age 11, and by 1965, he was operating his own investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). He still runs the company today.', 'Berkshire holds an incredible portfolio of public and private companies, and it has successfully navigated every post-Depression crisis to significantly outperform the benchmark S&P 500 over the last 58 years.', ""Berkshire's largest holding today is Apple, which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. Since then, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (parent company of Google), and Nvidia have all amassed trillion-dollar valuations of their own."", ""Thanks to Buffett's leadership, Berkshire is now valued at $772 billion, and its stellar track record suggests it could soon become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club. Here's why it could become a $1 trillion company as soon as 2024."", 'Image source: The Motley Fool.', 'Buffett is a value investor. He looks for profitable companies with consistent growth and strong management teams, and he especially likes those returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.', ""He waits patiently to grab those opportunities at a reasonable price. You won't find him chasing the latest stock market trends; in fact, he's often deploying billions of dollars when most other investors are selling."", ""However, Buffett's most powerful weapon is time. He buys stocks with the intention of holding for decades, which allows the effects of compounding to build his wealth for him. The companies he owns grow larger over time, and so do the dividends."", ""For example, Berkshire invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola between 1988 and 1994, acquiring 400 million shares, which it still owns today. Coca-Cola paid Berkshire a dividend of $75 million in 1994 -- in 2022, that dividend payment had swelled to $704 million! Not to mention the incredible capital growth; Berkshire's 400 million Coca-Cola shares are now worth $23.6 billion."", ""Berkshire Hathaway was founded as a textiles company in 1929, and Buffett acquired a controlling stake in 1965 when it was going through a rough patch. He quickly realized Berkshire's core business was no longer viable, so he turned it into a holding company for his various investments."", 'Today, it owns 51 different publicly traded stocks and securities worth a combined $365 billion, and Coca-Cola is just one of many success stories. The following are equally noteworthy:', 'American Express: Berkshire owns a 20% stake in the credit card giant, valued at $25.5 billion. But it all started with a $1.3 billion investment in the lead up to 1995, and today, the firm collects $304 million in dividends (and growing) every year.', ""Apple: Berkshire has invested around $35 billion in Apple stock since 2016 -- its largest ever bet. It has paid off handsomely because the stake is currently valued at more than $179 billion, accounting for almost half of the investment company's public portfolio."", 'Plus, Berkshire wholly owns several successful private businesses like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO.', ""Buffett has presided over substantial returns for investors. Between the time he acquired a controlling stake in Berkshire in 1965 and the end of 2022, the company's stock had delivered a mind-blowing gain of 3,787,464%."", ""That translates to a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is twice the return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. That would've been enough to turn a perfectly timed investment of just $100 into more than $3.7 million. The incredible gain comes on the back of a stellar operating performance by Buffett and his team."", 'Berkshire generated just $49 million in revenue in 1965, and by 2022, that had grown to a whopping $302 billion. Over $157 billion came from sales and services across its various businesses, with an additional $74 billion coming from insurance premiums and $52 billion coming from its railroad, utilities, and energy interests. The company is on track to increase that figure by 19% in 2023, to $360 billion.', ""Berkshire has delivered positive growth and strong stock returns during 11 different presidencies without straying from Buffett's fundamental strategy. With a presidential election coming up in 2024, that's a great reminder for everyday investors to stay the course, no matter which candidate wins."", ""As I mentioned earlier, Berkshire Hathaway is valued at $772 billion. Therefore, its stock needs to gain about 30% to propel the company into the $1 trillion club. Based on its average annual return of 19.8% since 1965, it doesn't appear likely to get there in 2024."", ""However, there's a good possibility Berkshire could outperform next year. History suggests 2024 will almost certainly bring more positive returns for the S&P 500, and Apple stock (Berkshire's largest holding) is entering the year near its best-ever level. Plus, some of Berkshire's top income producing stocks like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Bank of America are currently paying record dividends."", ""The broader macroeconomic environment will likely be more favorable in 2024, too. According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates five times throughout the year. That will be great for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses, and also its transport and logistics segments as lower rates should drive more economic growth."", 'Finally, as my Motley Fool colleague Sean Williams points out, Berkshire is buying back its own stock hand over fist. It has completed a whopping $72 billion worth of share repurchases during the past five years, so Buffett himself is clearly very bullish on its prospects.', ""Nevertheless, even if Berkshire doesn't make it into the $1 trillion club in 2024, it's only a matter of time."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'Where should you invest $1,000 right now?', ""Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For NiSource, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business.

Currently, a lack of insurance coverage and a supply shortage have limited the adoption of Ozempic and Wegovy.', 'Noise surrounding obesity drugs ramped up over the summer and reached a fever pitch in the fall, as Wall Street salivated at the prospect of a new $100 billion market.', 'Yet as investors take some time to reflect, many are realizing the initial fears of the drugs’ disruption of business are ""overblown,"" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone.', '""The market is starting to realize ... this is not having a material impact on food consumption today,"" Sundaram said. ""This is going to be a long-term trend ... [It\'s] not just going to be a 2023-2024 phenomenon, this is probably going to go on for the next decade. There\'s a lot of time for companies to react and adapt to changing spending environments.”', 'Food companies have weathered numerous dieting trends — think Atkins, Keto, Paleo, Whole30, and South Beach — and many have moved towards offering healthier and more diverse options in recent years.', 'To underscore the point, sales of dry goods are up 7.6% in the past 12 months, while frozen prepared foods are up 5.8%, according to data from NielsenIQ. McDonald’s, long synonymous with greasy burgers, clocked an 8.1% gain for same-store sales in its Q3 results and is planning a record restaurant expansion despite weight-loss drug proliferation.', 'However, decreased appetite and cravings could change people’s snacking habits and create an impact on fast food.', 'Brands that generate substantial sales from snackers or aren’t associated with mealtime — such as Jack in the Box (JACK), Yum!

I Am.” At the time, the housing market was in free fall, Lehman Brothers had just imploded, and the stock market tumbled 20% on its way to losing more than half its value before hitting bottom. Buffett’s column was a clarion call to be bullish about the future.', 'Buying stocks is an outward expression of optimism. You’re buying something today, believing it will grow into something more wonderful later on. It’s very much like the old saying, “A society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they know they’ll never sit.” Of course, in investing, we hope to enjoy the fruit of our labor one day. Buffett knows this like no one else.', 'Yet, as optimistic as Buffett is, sometimes he can turn bearish. He may be in such a mood today. Even though he\xa0bought several new stocks\xa0for\xa0Berkshire Hathaway\xa0(NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) in the third quarter, like\xa0Atlanta Braves Holdings\xa0(NASDAQ:BATRK) and\xa0Sirius XM Holdings\xa0(NASDAQ:SIRI), Buffett was a net seller of stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'In fact, this is the fourth consecutive quarter where Buffett sold billions of dollars more stock than he bought. In doing so, Berkshire Hathaway amassed a record $157 billion cash position. It suggests he’s keeping a lot of powder dry for a day when stocks crash, and he can swoop in to buy them up. What follows are the seven Warren Buffett stocks he completely sold off in the third quarter.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Buffett bought\xa0General Motors\xa0(NYSE:GM) over a decade ago amid a\xa0recovering U.S. economy and auto industry. The carmaker had numerous joint ventures underway in China, which had become its largest market. But Buffett was souring on GM in recent periods. In the second quarter, he slashed his holdings in the carmaker by 45%, and in the third quarter, he finally got rid of the remaining 22 million shares Berkshire Hathaway held.', 'It could be Buffett didn’t like the additional costs GM would be saddled with due to the contract settled with the United Auto Workers union. The UAW sprung a new strategy this year by striking against all the automakers simultaneously. The industry ground to a halt. It is a tactic other unions may adopt going forward, but it will\xa0significantly impair GM’s profitability. Labor costs will grow by $9.3 billion over the contract term that expires in April 2028 while inflating the cost of a new car by $575 each. Buffett simply no longer saw GM as an attractive investment.', 'Source: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com', 'Buffett also soured early on global chemicals specialist\xa0Celanese\xa0(NYSE:CE). He established the position in the first quarter of 2022 and then built it up over the year. He began shedding shares in this year’s first quarter. It’s a move that goes against the Oracle of Omaha’s typical buy-and-hold philosophy.', 'Certainly, Celanese looked to be a traditional Buffett stock. It’s a leader in its space and doesn’t have many competitors. It is profitable, produces substantial free cash flow, and pays a dividend yielding 2% annually. It’s not a growth company, however, and since the beginning of 2022, the chemicals stock has lost 16% of its value. It was trading at a discount when Buffett bought it, and it’s more so now, though shares are up 25% over the past month.', 'One of Buffett’s two investing lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, may have bought this stock. Although Buffett previously said any stock purchases over $1 billion would be his (the original CE purchase was for $1.1 billion), he has relinquished more control since then. The trade managers may have tired of the time a turnaround was taking.', 'Source: NPS_87 / Shutterstock.com', 'Buffett bought video game maker\xa0Activision Blizzard\xa0(NASDAQ:ATVI) as an arbitrage play.\xa0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was solidifying its position in the gaming market with the acquisition of Activision. Buffett held a small stake in the gamer but bumped it up to almost 10% after announcing the deal.', 'As the merger negotiations with regulators dragged on, Buffett started selling. In the second quarter, he dumped almost all of the shares he had bought for the arbitrage. Perhaps he believed the deal wouldn’t pass muster with U.K. and European regulators. But Microsoft surprised the market by agreeing to\xa0sell all the online streaming rights\xa0for all of Activision’s existing PC and console games released over the next 15 years to the U.K.’s\xa0Ubisoft Entertainment (OTCMKTS:UBSFY). The deal made it over the regulatory hurdles and was completed in mid-October. Buffett finally closed out his position.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'There was a time some 15 years ago when snacks giant\xa0Mondelez International\xa0(NYSE:MDLZ) was one of the most significant positions in Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett owned 132 million shares, representing a better than 9% stake in the portfolio. Mondelez, however, was known as Kraft Foods at the time. Buffett was\xa0betting on activist investor Nelson\xa0Peltz, forcing the company to spin off its businesses to buy back stock.', 'Mondelez and Kraft were subsequently separated, and Buffett helped private equity firm\xa03G Capital engineer a merger\xa0between Kraft and H.J. Heinz to form today’s\xa0Kraft Heinz\xa0(NYSE:KHC). Berkshire still has a substantial 325 million-share position in the company.', 'However, the Mondelez position languished. By 2013, Buffett had whittled the stake down to just 578,000 shares, and that’s where it stayed for the next decade. Ironically, the snacks company has outperformed the packaged food business. Since the spinoff in 2012, Mondelez has a total return of 215% compared to a 12% return by Kraft.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Package delivery leader\xa0United Parcel Service\xa0(NYSE:UPS) is another long-standing stock Buffett got rid of, albeit another small one. He owned only 59,400 shares worth $10 million. That\xa0made it the smallest holding\xa0in Berkshire Hathaway. It was never a large position, though. At its peak, there were about 1.4 million shares.', 'It means that whether Buffett continued to hold onto the stock or sell it off, it was an inconsequential stake. Tidying up the portfolio to put money aside for bigger and better purchases may have been the motivating factor here. The position wouldn’t have an impact even if it rocketed higher, and if Buffett is feeling bearish about the economy, the delivery company would feel the effects more.', 'Interestingly, it’s another stock that that’s has taken off over the past month. It’s up 10% compared to a 6% gain by the\xa0S&P 500.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'After\xa0refusing to sell\xa0for over two decades,\xa0Procter & Gamble\xa0(NYSE:PG) is the third small position Buffett finally decided to shed. Like his ownership of Mondelez, how Buffett came to own the consumer products company is a bit convoluted.', 'He acquired it by owning shares of Gillette’s razor company. It was eventually bought out by P&G, giving Buffett shares in the new business. He went on to buy more Procter & Gamble shares on his own but nearly sold them all off during the financial markets crisis to help bail out\xa0Goldman Sachs\xa0(NYSE:GS) and others.', 'The small stake he just got rid of (315,000 shares) is the remnants of that deal. The position was worth about $48 million, a small change in a $363 billion portfolio. It’s worth noting that as small as the position is, it was still bigger than some he just bought. The Atlanta Braves holding, for example, is worth just $8 million.', 'Source: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com', 'Last on the cleaning house list, but certainly not least, is healthcare titan\xa0Johnson & Johnson\xa0(NYSE:JNJ). Buffett shed all 327,100 shares, which were worth about $57 million. The fact that he held the stock almost as long as he owned Procter & Gamble probably also made it time for it to go.', 'The company is facing substantial legal liability from the lawsuits launched against its baby powder. It purportedly carries elevated cancer risk despite long-standing claims by the Food & Drug Administration that such\xa0formulations are perfectly safe. But why hold onto a potential headache that can drag on for years when better opportunities exist?', 'Well, one could have been Johnson & Johnson’s dividend. The blue-chip stock has been in business for 130 years and is a\xa0Dividend King, having raised its payout for over 60 years. It yields 2.9% annually.

The deal will bolster its position in the oil-rich Permian Basin. It will also increase the company's cash flow, giving it more fuel to pay dividends."", ""The deal is the latest in a wave of mergers in the oil patch as Occidental looks to keep pace with larger rivals ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). However, there's one notable difference between this purchase and the deals made by its peers -- a difference that could haunt the energy company in the future."", ""Occidental Petroleum is acquiring CrownRock in a cash-and-stock deal. CrownRock controls more than 94,000 acres in the Midland Basin side of the Permian, where it produces about 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) of high-margin oil. Occidental's management expects the purchase will increase its free cash flow by $1 billion next year, assuming oil averages $70 a barrel, which is right around the current price. "", ""In addition, CrownRock holds 1,700 untapped drilling locations, including 750 that are profitable to drill at sub-$40 oil. This will increase Occidental's sub-$40 drillable inventory by 25%."", ""The transaction will increase Occidental's scale in the Permian Basin, enabling it to leverage its operations to reduce costs. The combination of all these factors is giving Occidental the fuel and confidence to increase its dividend by 22%. "", 'This purchase follows the announcements of similar needle-moving deals by ExxonMobil and Chevron. ExxonMobil is acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources for $64.5 billion (including the assumption of debt), while Chevron is buying Hess for $60 billion (including the assumption of its debt). Those oil giants likewise expect their deals to increase their scale, enabling them to produce oil and natural gas more efficiently and cost-effectively. The acquisitions should also enhance their free cash flows over the long term. For example, Chevron expects its Hess acquisition and high-return capital program to more than double its free cash flow by 2027. ', ""The Occidental acquisition is most similar to ExxonMobil's deal. Pioneer Natural Resources is the leading producer in the Permian's Midland Basin (whereas the Hess deal adds the Bakken and Guyana to Chevron's portfolio). That greater scale will give ExxonMobil more opportunities to leverage technology to become an even more efficient operator, which should reduce costs. Occidental should see similar benefits from its scale-enhancing acquisition of CrownRock. "", ""There's one key difference between these megadeals.\xa0"", ""ExxonMobil and Chevron are both making all-stock acquisitions. The only debt they're taking on is what they're assuming from the acquired companies (which is 8% of the total value of ExxonMobil's deal and 12% of Chevron's transaction value). "", ""Occidental's deal has a completely different financing structure. It's only using $1.7 billion of stock to fund its $12 billion deal. To fund the rest, it's issuing $9.1 billion of new debt and assuming $1.2 billion of CrownRock's existing debt. In short, it's taking on debt to fund 86% of the transaction's value. "", ""However, Occidental does plan to pay off the bulk of this debt quickly. Along with the increased free cash flow from the deal, it's planning to launch a new asset sale program to raise between $4.5 billion and $6 billion in cash. That should enable Occidental to repay at least $4.5 billion of the debt it's taking on in the deal within the next year. "", ""The strategy is eerily similar to Occidental's funding plan in 2019 when it beat out Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum for $55 billion. The company struck a side deal with TotalEnergies to sell $8.8 billion of Anadarko's assets, which was part of its plan to sell between $10 billion and $15 billion of assets over 24 months. Those proceeds, along with free cash flow and expected deal synergies, were part of its plan to pay off a large portion of the debt it took on to acquire Anadarko. "", ""Unfortunately, that strategy didn't work out as well as planned. Government regulators blocked part of the TotalEnergies transaction, and oil prices collapsed the following year due to the pandemic, impacting Occidental's free cash flow and asset sales strategy. While it survived, it was a challenging time for the oil company and its investors. Hopefully, management's decision to make another debt-fueled acquisition won't come back to bite it again."", ""Occidental Petroleum is the latest oil company to make a splashy deal. Its $12 billion acquisition of CrownRock will enhance its position in the Permian Basin while boosting its free cash flow by $1 billion. However, it's taking on a lot of debt to get this deal done, which has burned it in the past. While it has a plan to pay off a big chunk of that debt within a year, an unexpected decline in oil prices could foil that plan and weigh on its stock price. That downside risk makes Occidental a less appealing oil stock right now.

She stopped him before he could utter a word."", '""Wait, we\'re not doing this here,"" Eleanor recalls telling Ivan in that moment. ""I knew he had something big to tell me.""', ""Big turned out to be an understatement. When they got home, Ivan shared that he'd just been diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's disease. He was 31 years old. Eleanor was 32."", ""Now, over a decade later, Eleanor shares how Ivan's diagnosis changed both of their lives-and how a Boston Scientific treatment helped them take a turn for the better."", ""Ivan's symptoms were subtle at first. He was finding it difficult to type certain keyboard commands, like control-alt-delete. When he'd lift his hand up, he noticed it shaking a little bit."", ""We now know these were early signs of Parkinson's disease. But it wasn't until Ivan took me to the emergency room one day after I'd cut my finger that he ultimately talked to a doctor about his symptoms. The doctor recommended he come back for a brain scan."", 'A few weeks later, we found ourselves in that food court.', ""A slow progression of Parkinson's symptoms"", ""When we started searching to learn more about Parkinson's, all we saw were images of older people. The advice we found didn't speak to us at all."", ""We were in denial as well, thinking, This isn't supposed to be happening. We're just starting out in life. For the first two years, Ivan had appointments every six months. While his symptoms were manageable, we had so many questions: Can Ivan keep working? Am I going to have to look after him indefinitely? Can we have a family?"", 'One night, Ivan started sobbing in bed and asked, ""What\'s to become of me?"" I didn\'t have an answer for him. But I said, ""Whatever it is, we\'ll get through it together.""', ""At first, life went on as usual for the most part. Ivan is an accountant and continued to work. I also continued working in the finance department of a multinational company. We had children: Effy, who's now 6 years old, and Ellis, who's 5."", ""Then, Ivan's Parkinson's symptoms started getting worse. He'd have to lay down in an empty conference room when he was at the office. He also had painful stiffness down the left side of his body and muscle cramping that made typing difficult. He went on leave in summer 2018 and hasn't returned since."", 'A few times, Ivan\'s stiffness and cramping was so bad that his chest tightened, leaving him gasping for breath. It was so hard to see him that way. I felt powerless. There were times I\'d say to Ivan, ""If I could take this from you for a day I would.""', 'I know it sounds selfish, but there were also times when I thought God, this diagnosis has ruined my life as well.', ""The Parkinson's treatment that changed everything"", 'Ivan could see the pressure on me. He felt so guilty about that and still does. But that was a dark time for us. I cried every day. The medication he\'d been prescribed made him feel so ill that he wouldn\'t take it. This would cause arguments between us, because when he didn\'t take the medication, he couldn\'t move for hours, literally stuck in a chair. Meanwhile I was juggling work and caring for our two young children. At one point I said to him, ""There comes a time where love isn\'t enough.""', ""Once Ivan started deteriorating, I was thankful his doctor talked to him about deep brain stimulation (DBS), a treatment that uses a small, surgically implanted device to send signals to a targeted portion of the brain. The stimulation can improve motor function by reducing Parkinson's symptoms such as tremor, slowness and stiffness. In February 2022, within a year of Ivan's doctors talking to him about DBS, Ivan was in the hospital having the procedure done."", ""We weren't naïve; we knew DBS would not cure his Parkinson's. But today, I can say our lives are so much better. Now, I'm able to do what I want, when I need to. I don't have worries about Ivan being with the children-he's moving well again. We have pretty much our normal lives back."", ""We had an eye-opening moment when Ivan went for his one-year follow-up after DBS. The doctors turned off the brain stimulation, and his symptoms quickly came back. We both cried. Those symptoms had become a distant memory. It was such a big realization of how the DBS is masking Ivan's Parkinson's."", ""But by God, it's a fantastic mask."", 'Advice for other caregivers', ""So many couples fall apart and don't make it through a Parkinson's diagnosis. After all, there is no cure."", ""I've learned a few things since Ivan's diagnosis that I hope can help others in our situation:"", ""Try to be open about your situation. I was forthcoming with my employers from day one of Ivan's diagnosis. Explaining it early on laid the groundwork for more understanding later. If you try not to bring this big, life-changing diagnosis that will undoubtedly impact you into your workplace, it will happen anyway. People will notice. I think you'll find people show you a lot more support than you think you'll get."", 'Remember it\'s OK to have your own needs. ""How\'s Ivan?"" This is a question I field all the time. It\'s never, ""How are you?"" It\'s OK to feel disappointed by this, and to seek out the people who do put your feelings first. I think more caregivers need to talk honestly about their emotions. It\'s not wrong to think these things. You can\'t be positive all the time. But if you keep the negative stuff bottled up, you can\'t be positive any of the time.', ""Look for the silver linings. Even though we've had a lot of dark times, every day we've had a good moment. And it's important to recognize those-to say, This is good today, and we are happy. Yes, this disease is awful.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

SCD patients report health-related quality of life scores well below the general population, and the lifetime health care costs in the U.S. of managing SCD for patients with recurrent VOCs is estimated between $4 and $6 million. SCD affects the red blood cells, which are essential for carrying oxygen to all organs and tissues of the body. SCD causes severe pain, organ damage and shortened life span due to misshapen or ""sickled"" red blood cells. The clinical hallmark of SCD is VOCs, which are caused by blockages of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells and result in severe and debilitating pain that can happen anywhere in the body at any time. SCD requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity. In the U.S., the median age of death for patients living with SCD is 45 years. Stem cell transplant from a matched donor is a curative option but is only available to a small fraction of patients living with SCD because of the lack of available donors.', 'About Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia (TDT)', 'TDT is a serious, life-threatening genetic disease. TDT patients report health-related quality of life scores below the general population, and the lifetime health care costs in the U.S. of managing TDT are estimated between $5 and $5.7 million. TDT requires frequent blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy throughout a person’s life. Due to anemia, patients living with TDT may experience fatigue and shortness of breath, and infants may develop failure to thrive, jaundice and feeding problems. Complications of TDT can also include an enlarged spleen, liver and/or heart, misshapen bones and delayed puberty. TDT requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity. In the U.S., the median age of death for patients living with TDT is 37 years. Stem cell transplant from a matched donor is a curative option but is only available to a small fraction of patients living with TDT because of the lack of available donors.', 'About CASGEVY™ (exagamglogene autotemcel [exa-cel])', 'CASGEVY is a genome-edited cellular therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) edited by CRISPR/Cas9 technology at the erythroid-specific enhancer region of the BCL11A gene. CASGEVY is intended for one time administration via a hematopoietic stem cell transplant procedure where the patient’s own CD34+ cells are modified to reduce BCL11A expression in erythroid lineage cells, leading to increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. CASGEVY has been shown to reduce or eliminate vaso-occlusive crises for patients with SCD.', 'CASGEVY was granted a conditional marketing authorization in Great Britain by the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and by the National Health Regulatory Authority in Bahrain for patients 12 years of age and older with SCD characterized by recurrent vaso-occlusive crises or TDT, for whom hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen matched related hematopoietic stem cell donor is not available.

You should discuss options for fertility preservation with your healthcare provider before treatment.', 'STEP 1: Before CASGEVY treatment, a doctor will give you a mobilization medicine. This medicine moves blood stem cells from your bone marrow into the blood stream. The blood stem cells are then collected in a machine that separates the different blood cells (this is called apheresis). This entire process may happen more than once. Each time, it can take up to one week.', 'During this step, rescue cells are also collected and stored at the hospital. These are your existing blood stem cells and are kept untreated just in case there is a problem in the treatment process. If CASGEVY cannot be given after the conditioning medicine, or if the modified blood stem cells do not take hold (engraft) in the body, these rescue cells will be given back to you. If you are given rescue cells, you will not have any treatment benefit from CASGEVY.', 'STEP 2: After they are collected, your blood stem cells will be sent to the manufacturing site where they are used to make CASGEVY. It may take up to 6 months from the time your cells are collected to manufacture and test CASGEVY before it is sent back to your healthcare provider.', 'STEP 3: Shortly before your stem cell transplant, your healthcare provider will give you a conditioning medicine for a few days in hospital. This will prepare you for treatment by clearing cells from the bone marrow, so they can be replaced with the modified cells in CASGEVY. After you are given this medicine, your blood cell levels will fall to very low levels. You will stay in the hospital for this step and remain in the hospital until after the infusion with CASGEVY.', 'STEP 4: One or more vials of CASGEVY will be given into a vein (intravenous infusion) over a short period of time.', 'After the CASGEVY infusion, you will stay in hospital so that your healthcare provider can closely monitor your recovery.

This technology can selectively delete, modify or correct a disease-causing abnormality in a specific DNA segment. Per the FDA, the Casgevy approval marks an important “innovative advancement” in the world of gene therapies. Lyfgenia uses a lentiviral vector (gene delivery vehicle) for genetic modifications.', 'A rare blood disorder, SCD is a condition marked by a mutation in hemoglobin, which causes red blood cells to develop a crescent or ‘sickle’ shape. These cells impair the ability of red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the body’s tissues, thereby leading to severe pain and organ damage called vaso-occlusive events (VOEs) or vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Prior to the Casgevy and Lyfgenia approvals, the only longer-term treatment for SCD was a bone marrow transplant that requires matching donors.', 'The FDA approvals are based on positive data from the companies’ clinical studies, wherein treatment with both therapies have helped reduce painful episodes in SCD patients.', 'Despite the positive news, the share prices of all three companies were down on Friday after the FDA’s announcement. While bluebird’s stock plunged 40.5%, both CRISPR and Vertex lost 8.1% and 1.1%, respectively.', 'This was likely due to the conditions required to be fulfilled to become eligible for treatment with either of the gene therapies. Both Casgevy and Lyfgenia utilize a patient’s blood stem cells, which are modified and then infused as one-time single-shot treatment as part of a hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant. This process of collecting stem cells requires the use of high-dose chemotherapy, and such modifying stem cells can take up to six months alone.', 'In addition to time, both gene therapies have been priced high. In an SEC filing, Vertex and CRISPR disclosed that they would commercially launch Casgevy at $2.1 million. In a separate press release, bluebird announced that it will launch Lyfgenia at $3.1 million.', 'Despite overcoming the time and price stipulations, treatment with either the CRISPR/Vertex or bluebird gene therapies also has its fair share of side effects, which include low levels of platelets, white blood cells and fertility problems.', 'Lyfgenia label also includes a black box warning for hematologic malignancy (blood cancer). Patients infused with the bluebird therapy are required to be monitored for this malignancy for life. This was one of the major reasons for the significant decline of bluebird bio’s stock.', 'Despite the above points, each therapy has an equal opportunity to exploit the market. While bluebird’s gene therapy comes at a higher price point and also carries a black box warning, bluebird bio’s experience with marketing other gene therapies gives it a significant advantage over Vertex/CRISPR.', 'Currently, bluebird markets Zynteglo for beta-thalassemia and Skysona for active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, both of which received FDA approval last year. Casgevy is Vertex’s first approved therapy outside of its marketed portfolio of cystic fibrosis drugs and its first-ever FDA approved therapy for CRISPR Therapeutics.', 'The FDA is also reviewing Casgevy as a potential treatment for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, with a final decision expected by Mar 30, 2024.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Casgevy, developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), is a one-time treatment that harnesses gene editing advancements. However, the therapy faces accessibility hurdles, according to Wedbush Managing Director David Nierengarten. Despite providing a lifelong cure, he believes the complex procedure and recovery alongside the expensive price tag will be challenging to market to patients.', 'Nierengarten believes uptake will be limited to most acute cases given process difficulties. The length of time for treatment preparation, hospitalization, and healing poses barriers. Low enrollment in clinical trials is ""not surprising"" per Nierengarten, as ""the real barrier here is the procedure itself.""', 'Accessing facilities able to perform the bone marrow transplant involved also raises logistics issues. He notes trial sites were in areas with small sickle cell populations. ""The time it takes to do it and the difficulties involved with it"" are key obstacles, Nierengarten told Yahoo Finance. Though transformative for patients, real-world availability of the therapy faces multiple constraints.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""- A technical achievement and no doubt, scientific breakthrough and discoveries here. So now, the company swiftly moved towards, OK. How do we get this into the market and how do we make sure that we're advancing some of what we've been able to develop around here?

I think there are going to be discounts here that will not be the true net price that these companies realize. But really, a bigger challenge for getting access to this technology is the process involved with this."", ""The patients are essentially undergoing a bone marrow transplant. This requires them to spend several months preparing for the procedure and then several weeks-- four to six weeks in the hospital. As you can imagine, that's very difficult for a lot of people to stomach, and that is the real challenge here. Is trying to market this technology in the face of this relatively challenging procedure."", 'I do think it will be limited to the most severe of these patients-- of sickle cell patients. But again, for those patients who are willing to do this, it can provide a life long cure.', ""- When it comes to that lifelong cure, obviously there's a clearly an incentive here for patients to want to try if it makes the most sense for them to have access to these types of drugs. When you try to guesstimate what the adoption is going to look like when you take a more longer term view, 10 years from now, what does that look like at least from where you stand today?"", 'DAVID NIERENGARTEN: Honestly, it looks like low single digit percentage. I do think that is kind of a ceiling on the number of patients who are severe enough that they would undergo this procedure. But these are patients who are in truly bad shape. Patients-- you can see 13, 14, 15-year-old patients with stroke, heart attack, never mind the, you know, excruciating pain that they go through when they do have the crises going to the hospital and for multiple days, to treat the pain and other effects from the disease.', ""So for those patients, it's going to be truly transformative. But it is going to be a small percentage of patients in my opinion."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: David, Anjalee here. I know I've heard similar, in part because of access issues in terms of location, in terms of the price point, when it comes to the fact that this is something new, is that low uptake and surprising in any way?"", ""DAVID NIERENGARTEN: I think it's-- when you think about the procedure, it's not surprising. I think if this were a shorter procedure, if it only took a few days in the hospital, if there were other, you know, ameliorating factors to the procedure, I think you would see a higher adoption rate."", 'But yes, I think the real barrier here is the procedure itself. The time it takes to do it and the difficulties involved with it. You mentioned access and sites. That is going to be another issue. You need a, essentially, bone marrow transplant site. And many of the sites that the companies run their clinical trials in frankly have relatively low populations of sickle cell patients. And they need to expand sites, in my opinion, to other areas of the country that have more patients locally.']"

He still runs the company today.', 'Berkshire holds an incredible portfolio of public and private companies, and it has successfully navigated every post-Depression crisis to significantly outperform the benchmark S&P 500 over the last 58 years.', ""Berkshire's largest holding today is Apple, which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. Since then, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (parent company of Google), and Nvidia have all amassed trillion-dollar valuations of their own."", ""Thanks to Buffett's leadership, Berkshire is now valued at $772 billion, and its stellar track record suggests it could soon become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club. Here's why it could become a $1 trillion company as soon as 2024."", 'Image source: The Motley Fool.', 'Buffett is a value investor. He looks for profitable companies with consistent growth and strong management teams, and he especially likes those returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.', ""He waits patiently to grab those opportunities at a reasonable price. You won't find him chasing the latest stock market trends; in fact, he's often deploying billions of dollars when most other investors are selling."", ""However, Buffett's most powerful weapon is time. He buys stocks with the intention of holding for decades, which allows the effects of compounding to build his wealth for him. The companies he owns grow larger over time, and so do the dividends."", ""For example, Berkshire invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola between 1988 and 1994, acquiring 400 million shares, which it still owns today. Coca-Cola paid Berkshire a dividend of $75 million in 1994 -- in 2022, that dividend payment had swelled to $704 million! Not to mention the incredible capital growth; Berkshire's 400 million Coca-Cola shares are now worth $23.6 billion."", ""Berkshire Hathaway was founded as a textiles company in 1929, and Buffett acquired a controlling stake in 1965 when it was going through a rough patch. He quickly realized Berkshire's core business was no longer viable, so he turned it into a holding company for his various investments."", 'Today, it owns 51 different publicly traded stocks and securities worth a combined $365 billion, and Coca-Cola is just one of many success stories. The following are equally noteworthy:', 'American Express: Berkshire owns a 20% stake in the credit card giant, valued at $25.5 billion. But it all started with a $1.3 billion investment in the lead up to 1995, and today, the firm collects $304 million in dividends (and growing) every year.', ""Apple: Berkshire has invested around $35 billion in Apple stock since 2016 -- its largest ever bet. It has paid off handsomely because the stake is currently valued at more than $179 billion, accounting for almost half of the investment company's public portfolio."", 'Plus, Berkshire wholly owns several successful private businesses like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO.', ""Buffett has presided over substantial returns for investors. Between the time he acquired a controlling stake in Berkshire in 1965 and the end of 2022, the company's stock had delivered a mind-blowing gain of 3,787,464%."", ""That translates to a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is twice the return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. That would've been enough to turn a perfectly timed investment of just $100 into more than $3.7 million. The incredible gain comes on the back of a stellar operating performance by Buffett and his team."", 'Berkshire generated just $49 million in revenue in 1965, and by 2022, that had grown to a whopping $302 billion. Over $157 billion came from sales and services across its various businesses, with an additional $74 billion coming from insurance premiums and $52 billion coming from its railroad, utilities, and energy interests. The company is on track to increase that figure by 19% in 2023, to $360 billion.', ""Berkshire has delivered positive growth and strong stock returns during 11 different presidencies without straying from Buffett's fundamental strategy. With a presidential election coming up in 2024, that's a great reminder for everyday investors to stay the course, no matter which candidate wins."", ""As I mentioned earlier, Berkshire Hathaway is valued at $772 billion. Therefore, its stock needs to gain about 30% to propel the company into the $1 trillion club. Based on its average annual return of 19.8% since 1965, it doesn't appear likely to get there in 2024."", ""However, there's a good possibility Berkshire could outperform next year. History suggests 2024 will almost certainly bring more positive returns for the S&P 500, and Apple stock (Berkshire's largest holding) is entering the year near its best-ever level. Plus, some of Berkshire's top income producing stocks like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Bank of America are currently paying record dividends."", ""The broader macroeconomic environment will likely be more favorable in 2024, too. According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates five times throughout the year. That will be great for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses, and also its transport and logistics segments as lower rates should drive more economic growth."", 'Finally, as my Motley Fool colleague Sean Williams points out, Berkshire is buying back its own stock hand over fist. It has completed a whopping $72 billion worth of share repurchases during the past five years, so Buffett himself is clearly very bullish on its prospects.', ""Nevertheless, even if Berkshire doesn't make it into the $1 trillion club in 2024, it's only a matter of time."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'Where should you invest $1,000 right now?', ""Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

It's great to be here."", ""Dylan Lewis: Today we are going to celebrate one of the greatest investors of all time this week. Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett's right hand man passed away at the age of 99. David Munger was a source of wisdom, and humor for the investing community and the business world for such a long time. We're going to spend today's show talking through his impact, his legacy, some of the lessons that will carry forward. I feel the best place to start that conversation is probably his Mungerisms and some of his writings. I gave one in the intro of the show. But he is so notable and so quotable. I'm curious, what is something that has stuck out to you from the past?"", ""David Meier: For those of you that don't know me, I was actually an engineer before I joined the Motley Fool and the quote that has always stuck with me from Munger is always invert. Why would that be? Well, I can tell you, having tried to solve a lot of engineering problems, many times, the insight always came from, I know what the answer is. [laughs] Let me figure out what I need to do in order to get there, and that is exactly what he's talking about. Especially with investing, imagine you want a business to be great, you don't have to know what all the steps are going forward. Just look forward and say, this business is ten times as big as it is now and ask yourself, what would it have to do in order to get there? What that does is that frees your mind to figure out, from a number standpoint, what does it have to do? From a competitive standpoint, what might it do/ who do I have to worry about from a competitive standpoint? Who is it going up against? How are his customers going to react? What pricing does it? To me, and again, it's because of my engineering background that I know that that one resonated with me, but that is so profound yet so simple."", ""Dylan Lewis: What is so great about that one, David, is it's a framework. It's a way of thinking about things. That is such a large part of how he approached investing and how we really thought about thinking."", ""David Meier: [laughs] One of the interesting things, at least as I picked up on his personality, is he was never going to give you an answer. If you asked him a question, what's 2+2, he's not going to tell you the answer is four. He always wanted to give you the framework to have you think about what the answer should be. In his whole life, that was always what he wanted to do. He wanted you to think. Because we're all different, we all approach problems in different ways, and so to say that there's one answer in business is ridiculous. But here's how he would communicate, here's how I might think about it, here's how others might think about it. Yes, frameworks were his thing. I have to say when I was at Wake Forest for getting my MBA, the best class that I had was a strategy class and that's all the professor taught was, here's a framework for how to think about this problem. Putting them together and integrating them, which is another thing that Munger thought was very important, 1+1+1 is not equal 3 if you integrate them together. He would say, it could be six, could be nine, could be 1,000 But, yes, the integration of frameworks was a big part of his legacy."", 'Dylan Lewis: In that vein, David, one of my favorite quotes is, ""we have three baskets for investing. Yes, no, and too tough to understand"". [laughs] Because to your point, what someone might think of as too tough to understand is perfectly in the wheel house of another investor. It\'s not overly prescriptive to the point where it says avoid this, don\'t avoid that. But it\'s an easy framework for other people to borrow, and then take their own life experiences, their own expertise and apply to.', 'David Meier: Sure. Warren Buffett is the perfect example of that. Warren Buffett, for every year that he has ever been alive, has basically said, ""I don\'t understand technology, therefore I\'m not going to invest in it."" So many people would say, ""No, it\'s easy. Warren, you just have to think about it."" Warren would be like, ""No, it\'s just it\'s too hard for me."" Warren, that was something definitely that they, as a partnership both believed in it. I can imagine, Charlie basically sometimes holding Warren\'s feet to the fire saying, ""Are you sure you understand this business?"" But, yes, there\'s plenty of ideas, in my two hard pile which is behind me.', ""Dylan Lewis: For a lot of investors, especially new investors, it's great advice because there's this expectation that, the more sophisticated you get, the better you understand something and that you get style points almost for finding these novel ideas. The reality is no, you don't."", 'David Meier: No. In fact, you might be taking on additional risk which is exactly how I think Munger would think about it. Markets are competitive. If you\'re going up against someone who has better information than you and can organize it better, he would immediately say, ""I\'m not playing that game. There\'s no reason for me to play that game."" It\'s a perfect message for beginning investors. I love what you just said there because just be, know what you\'re good at. You very well might be a line toward consumers, maybe you have an officiator, you\'re a foodie and you know about restaurants, stick there, learn about those businesses. It\'s a really good Mungerism.', ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the partnership and the back and forth between Munger and Buffett, which is incredibly well documented, as is their success at Berkshire Hathaway. But I thought given the opportunity, it might be good for us to put some numbers to what the firm has been able to do with those two at the helm. We count it now as one of the most valuable companies in the world. That is a far cry from where the partnership originally started, and it's probably one of the greatest investing stories of all time."", ""David Meier: Let me take one half step back in order to set some context for this. One of the things that is underappreciated about Munger is he was stoic and he didn't talk a lot, but he was definitely a deep thinker and he was a heck of a visionary. If you look at his analysis of Coca-Cola, he projected way into the future about what Coke could become and then worked backwards invert to figure out how it was going to get there. He must have done the same thing with Warren. He must have looked out and said Warren is going to be massively successful and we're going to be investing a lot of money at some point, so let me help develop a framework to scale. Because traditional value investing, which is where Warren came from, the Ben Graham School, that's not scalable. You can't manage very large sums of money playing that game. Let's take you back to 1982. In the 1982 Chairman's letter, those two were investing, the market value of the publicly traded portfolio was $946 million just under $1 billion. There's plenty of value funds out there that are doing that. In 1992, the market value of their publicly traded portfolio was almost $11.5 billion. That's getting difficult. Again, you have to take this great company, long-term growth mindset in order to scale your portfolio up just over 10X. Fast forward, 30 years, 2022, they're managing $350 billion. Munger put together a process that enabled them to go from a billion dollars of capital invested in 1982 to $350 billion and they're still making investment returns. That is amazing."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's incredible for so many reasons. One of them is the success for this style and for investing in general gets harder and harder to come by the larger you get. We've heard Buffett, and we've heard Munger talk about so much, there are only so many things that move the needle when your portfolio is that size and yet they continue to find them."", ""David Meier: They continue to do it. The other piece of this that is very important, and I know Munger had a big influence on this, was the structure of Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire gets most of its capital from its insurance organizations. People give them money to ensure things, they take the money, they invest it. Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to generate huge returns, and the reason is, is because Munger and Buffett structured the company to essentially have a zero cost of capital. If my business success is based on the spread between how much my capital costs and how much my capital earns, Having zero as your cost of capital which essentially is what it is. That's a huge advantage if you're going to be an ultra long term investor. But it's not that I'm going to be safe, like they're not parking these in treasuries and trying to get you 2, 3, 5%, one of the investments that Munger directly responsible for is a company called BYD, which is the battery maker in China. He's been high on this company for a long time. Since they invested in it, it's a 33 bagger. 33X. Again, we're not talking risk less investing, but even with zero cost of capital, you put 33X on top of, $250,000,000 investment at essentially zero cost that, again the numbers is astounding."", ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah. They're absolutely incredible and it's a hard model to build for yourself. You need an insurance business or something that gives you that cash at a low or no cost, but if you can find it, it winds up being an incredibly lucrative model."", 'David Meier: Absolutely. Again, these two together, they fed off of each other. Munger made Buffett a better investor and better businessman, and the reciprocal happened as well. Together they just made an incredible investment company.', ""Dylan Lewis: I think one of the other investing lessons for me from Munger and really from the duo, and the dynamic that they had was his comfort with concentration, which is a little different than, I think where Buffett probably started and certainly very different than how a lot of investors tend to think about concentration. We, especially when people are getting started early on, really espouse the benefits of diversification, because it can save you from a lot of mistakes and from taking on too much risk. But I think Munger perfected this. You learn the rules, you break the rules, and then you become very confident in how you break the rules over time and his view was so much more, it's OK to be highly concentrated because it's in some ways just a measure of conviction and finding opportunities and acting on them."", ""David Meier: For most people, an investment in the S&P 500 index is the right choice because investing is not what they do every day. If you're not in the game, so to speak, every day, analyzing businesses, talking with other business men and women, in the markets, that's what Buffett and Munger did every day. It makes complete sense from that perspective. If this is what you're an expert in and you come across a good idea, you don't put two% of your portfolio in it. You put 20% of your portfolio at it."", 'Dylan Lewis: Yeah. Just look at their steak and apple.', ""David Meier: Correct. The concentration can be scary, but again, if this is something that is your passion and you're an expert at, and you do every day, you can run a concentrated portfolio. I will say at one point I had a stock that was 85% of my portfolio."", ""Dylan Lewis: That's high."", ""David Meier: That's pretty high."", ""Dylan Lewis: That's really high. How did you feel about that?"", ""David Meier: It got there the right way. It got there because I put 15% of my portfolio and it turned out to be a good investment. Sometimes it was a little hard to sleep at night, knowing it was that much. But, when I would go through and I would reassess, where's the company today, what's it doing? How you know, is the stock price ridiculously overvalued or does it still have some appreciation? Again, that's what I do every day. For a limited time I was comfortable with it. Through Munger, I don't have a problem with the concentration when it's warranted."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think the key with that is it's a lot of concentration paired with the discipline of when it makes sense for that concentration."", 'David Meier: You have to have both.', 'Dylan Lewis: Yeah.', 'David Meier: You have to have both.', 'Dylan Lewis: They talk about that. There\'s a quote that I\'ll pull up here that I think is relevant. You mentioned the game of investing earlier. It says, ""The whole trick of the game is to have a few times when you know something is better than average and invest only where you have that extra knowledge."" It gets to the expertise point you were talking about earlier and I think, the idea here is we are not heavily concentrated all the time, we\'re heavily concentrated during those generational moments where we see an opportunity.', ""David Meier: Yes, the business school adage with more risk, you should expect more return. Directionally, that's correct, but if you have a massive opportunity and the risk is low, your concentration in that opportunity should go up. It's a risk assessment risk management game at that point."", ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah, 100% and it's something I've borrowed as well. You talked about using it a little bit in your own portfolio. I have a company that it's not 85%, 25% of my individual stock portfolio and think in the abstract, probably too much, but I take a look at the business and where it's positioned and I say, I just don't see how this company gets disrupted. I just don't see how this opportunity goes away and that gives me the confidence to maintain the position and it has been one of those positions that's grown and grown over time for all the right reasons. I've just continued to let it go there. Munger style."", ""David Meier: Very good. No, you're borrowing his knowledge and wisdom perfectly there."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think one of the things I like about his knowledge and wisdom is it's investing in business advice. But a lot of it is life advice through the lens of investing and business and I think as we wrap it probably makes sense to talk a little bit just about some life lessons from Munger because I see so many in his quotations."", ""David Meier: Absolutely. I really appreciate the one that you brought to the beginning of the show which is learn, and not only did he say that, but he lived it and he has also been charitable. He does a lot of work with universities. Learning is at the absolute center of his entire ethos. In some respects, I don't think he really cares that he's a billionaire. It's great, but that's not who he is. He's much more comfortable being a person who helped the world, make the world a little bit of a better place, helped people get smarter, influenced people to make better decisions. I have to say, along those lines, again, as an engineer, I came in with the attitude, when I came to the Motley Fool and I came into investing, I came in with the attitude of, look, I'm really good with numbers, like I should be able to find opportunities and I'll be able to suss them out better than other people can, and I'll make a lot of money, and then I read his analysis of Coca-Cola and I'm like, yeah, there's like 5% numbers, 95% qualitative analysis. It was psychology, competitiveness and aftertaste versus no aftertaste and I'm like, yeah, I'm totally doing this wrong. I changed my style as a result of that while I was here at the Motley Fool, which is another benefit of working for our company. You're going to grow. You need to have a learning mindset because that is something that is important to the Gardner brothers as well."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think to your point there earlier about the way that he viewed money, I think Munger primarily viewed money and wealth is really just an opportunity for him to spend his time the way that he wanted to and in his case, so much of that was deciding to read, deciding to learn. I think he made a joke at one point that, his grandchildren probably see him as a book with legs because he's so often just sitting there in the chair reading a book and I think that learning mindset for him is such a large part of what I take away from his career. I think one of the things that sticks out to me in that vein is like we talk so much about Buffett and Munger together. The formal partnership of Buffett and Munger didn't actually start until Munger was in his '50s. They had known each other for a little while before that. I think about a decade and a half before that, but so much of what we know of this man and his legacy was something that didn't start until he was halfway through his life. He'd been investing before that, but not with Warren Buffett. I think it's an apt reminder that there is so much in front of you, no matter what stage you are at in life. If you're embracing the learning mindset, if you're embracing whatever life will continue to throw at you."", ""David Meier: I completely agree. For those of you who may not know, he's a lawyer by training, he had a law firm. He was a partner in a big law firm actually, and he switched careers. I would like to think that I had a similar epiphany, if you will. You know what? The reason I changed careers. One, I realized I'm making actually more money as investing my portfolio than I am as an engineer and I love it. It was at that point that I'm like, you know what, I just need to make a switch and I had no plans to do this ever like, the reason I came to the Motley Fool as a reader was, I had just gotten married, we had just moved, I just had my first job and I was like, you know what, we're going to want to buy a house, we're going to want to have kids, I need to start learning about investing and the more I learned, the more I was just completely taken with the subject. Basically, for about seven years I prepped, became a personal investor prepped through the Motley Fool before I landed a job here in 2005. We talked a little bit about this on the morning show, but if there was one thing that if you wanted to pay homage to Munger today, you know which we're doing here because we appreciate everything that he's taught us over the years, go read a book on a topic that you don't know anything about and you just want to learn . That is what would make Charlie Munger so much happier than one of us making a good investment decision. He would rather us read a book and learn something."", ""Dylan Lewis: That seems like a perfect way to wrap today's show. David Meier, thank you so much for joining me today."", 'David Meier: Thanks, Dylan. Really appreciate it.', ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, we mentioned a few of our favorite Mungerisms and stories, we'd love to hear yours podcasts at Fool.com is where you can send them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the industrial sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The industrial sector in the US is a cornerstone of the economy, encompassing manufacturing, construction, mining, and utilities. The industry has undergone significant transformations, adapting to globalization, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer demands. Automation and digitalization have revolutionized production methods, improving efficiency but also altering the employment landscape. Industrial stocks, typically known for their stability and resilience, often outperform the broader market during periods of economic expansion and recovery. However, despite their historical strength, this year has seen a deviation from the norm. The S&P 500 Industrial Index, which tracks the performance of companies like General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), has gained 10.53% in 2023 so far, compared with a 20.7% gain of the S&P 500.', ""Despite the industrial sector's underperformance this year, analysts see this as an opportunity for potential investment. Fidelity Investments mentioned in a report that the US hasn't invested enough in industries for many years. Problems with supply chains during the pandemic and global tensions made it clear that the US should be more self-reliant in industry stuff. Now, the government plans to put hundreds of billions of dollars into building roads and bridges, bringing back jobs to the US, dealing with climate change, and using more electricity. Legislation like the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are expected to channel hundreds of billions of dollars into these areas. This big investment could help the industrial sector grow a lot in the long run. The report further mentioned that there have been some sectors showing promise for investment opportunities. These include commercial aerospace, utility infrastructure, residential construction, and shipping companies."", ""Another report from Morningstar also backed up this perspective. According to their findings, construction firms have been leading the way in stock performance this year. However, companies more focused on commercial construction have fallen behind, mainly because of worries surrounding the commercial real estate market. The report also highlighted the firm's positive view of the construction industry in the long term. They believe that despite certain short-term setbacks, there's a favorable outlook. They pointed out that the IRA is likely to keep supporting the industry, especially by encouraging eco-friendly building methods and materials."", 'Although many investors view AI as primarily related to technology, Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities, suggests that the potential advantages of industrials might be an overlooked storyline that deserves a closer look. Sohn mentioned in his interview that the industrial sector had shown strong performance over the past few months. He suggested that the effects of this trend were becoming evident in various securities. According to FactSet data, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) has surged by nearly 11% this year, accompanied by inflows surpassing $903 million as of August 2023. He added that for investors seeking a broader investment scope beyond the technology surge, industrials stand positioned to gain advantages from the surge in AI-driven efficiency and productivity, particularly within robotics and automation companies.', 'Many industrial companies, especially those with established positions and stable cash flows, tend to pay out dividends regularly.

The benchmark has registered the longest streak of weekly gains since November 2019, closing at the highest level since March 2022. The solid trend is likely to continue in 2024, with many analysts turning bullish on the benchmark.The S&P 500 has gained more than 20% so far this year but is shy of 4% from its record high in late 2021. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen about 21% this year. Though most of the stocks in the ETF have returned handsomely, many are undervalued, as reflected in their lower P/E ratio than industry peers. The fund has good potential for the next year. The constituent stocks have a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B or better, suggesting their outperformance in the months to come.These include Everest Group Ltd. EG, Comcast Corporation CMCSA, 3M Company MMM, Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP and DaVita Inc. DVA.According to Bloomberg’s latest Markets Live Pulse survey, a median of 518 respondents expects the S&P 500 to climb to 4,808 points next year, outpacing its previous closing peak of 4,797 hit in January 2022.Fundstrat Tom Lee, who has been one of the most persistently bullish forecasters on Wall Street this year, expects that stocks will surge to a new all-time high in 2024 as the Fed shifts to a less restrictive monetary policy. He anticipates that the S&P 500 could soar to 5,200 by the end of 2024, marking a 13% increase from its current level. This optimism is partly based on the expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year as inflation eases. Rates, which have risen to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, could potentially drop to 3.2%-3.5% (read: What Lies Ahead of S&P 500 ETFs in 2024?).Tom Lee said that narrowing credit spreads and a rally in high-yield bond prices suggest an ongoing liquidity rally. Despite significant withdrawals from stocks this year, cyclical stocks, bank stocks and small-cap stocks have shown an upward trend, indicating that the market is in a state of expansion, supporting the uptrend in equities.Other Wall Street forecasters are also optimistic, with the U.S. avoiding a recession and inflation cooling. Major financial institutions like Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale predict that the S&P 500 could hit new highs in 2024.After the astounding surge of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, the rally has been broadening out in recent weeks. As more underperforming members of the S&P 500 catch up, the index should continue to climb, even if the rise in the Magnificent Seven stalls out. Per a strategist at Bank of America, only about 24% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading within 10% of their all-time highs. This is notably lower than the historical average of 28%. This suggests that many stocks in the index may be undervalued and have the potential to rise toward their peak values.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.', 'SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.3% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $442 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year.

The industry has undergone significant transformations, adapting to globalization, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer demands. Automation and digitalization have revolutionized production methods, improving efficiency but also altering the employment landscape. Industrial stocks, typically known for their stability and resilience, often outperform the broader market during periods of economic expansion and recovery. However, despite their historical strength, this year has seen a deviation from the norm.

Fidelity Investments mentioned in a report that the US hasn't invested enough in industries for many years. Problems with supply chains during the pandemic and global tensions made it clear that the US should be more self-reliant in industry stuff. Now, the government plans to put hundreds of billions of dollars into building roads and bridges, bringing back jobs to the US, dealing with climate change, and using more electricity. Legislation like the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are expected to channel hundreds of billions of dollars into these areas. This big investment could help the industrial sector grow a lot in the long run. The report further mentioned that there have been some sectors showing promise for investment opportunities. These include commercial aerospace, utility infrastructure, residential construction, and shipping companies."", ""Another report from Morningstar also backed up this perspective.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', ""As 2023 draws to a close, experts are evaluating how different industries have fared this year compared to the previous one. Various sectors experienced contrasting outcomes, influenced by ongoing political and economic factors. The energy sector in the US maintained stability throughout 2022, largely attributed to elevated prices and limited supplies. Closing the year with remarkable growth, it surged by 58% by December 30, a stark contrast to the S&P 500's approximately 20% decline. Notably, according to Dow Jones Market Data, this marked the first instance of the energy sector standing out as the sole victor in the S&P 500 annual performance, and it was the only sector that didn't witness a decline throughout the year. This year, the situation has reversed, as energy stocks are now trailing behind the overall market performance. The S&P 500 Energy is down by 7.31% in 2023 so far, compared with a 20.40% gain of the S&P 500."", 'In addition to this, the largest American exchange-traded fund (ETF) that follows clean energy stocks was set to mark its highest yearly outflows ever due to several factors. Rapidly increasing interest rates, rising prices of raw materials, and disruptions in the supply chain have diminished the appeal of this fund for investors. As per Lipper data, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF has recorded more than $1 billion in net outflows as of November 2023. This ETF, which was once favored during the pandemic, had experienced substantial net inflows of over $2 billion annually in both 2020 and 2021. However, investors have been pulling out of this ETF amid the escalation of interest rates. Moreover, more investors are heavily invested in technology stocks compared to energy stocks than they have been since September 2021, according to a Bank of America survey. The report mentioned that the managers have allocated the least amount of money to energy shares since December 2020.', ""Despite a recent slowdown, energy stocks have proven advantageous for investors over the past three years, soaring by more than 200%. This growth aligned with the rise in oil prices from their low points over multiple years. These years serve as a valuable lesson for investors, illustrating the correlation between energy stock performance and substantial fluctuations in oil prices. Moreover, the energy sector has changed notably, with many companies allocating more funds to dividends for investors while cutting back on new drilling. This shift has reshaped how energy investments work, underscoring these companies' evolving strategies focused on boosting returns for shareholders."", ""Analysts are also positive about the sector’s outlook. Todd\xa0 Sohn, a managing director in ETF and technical strategy, mentioned in an interview that there's a slight improvement in energy's performance despite the outflows. This doesn't stand as a clear signal on its own, but it hints at a positive change in sentiment. He suggests that this situation could now be seen as an opportunity for a contrarian move. Investors are attracted to energy companies because their stock prices are relatively low compared to some of the major technology stocks that drove the market's growth this year. They're seeking to expand their investments beyond the dominant tech stocks and see potential in the energy sector."", 'Another reason for investors’ inclination toward energy stocks is their commitment to shareholder return. Over the years, energy companies have maintained a practice of sharing profits with shareholders in the form of dividends, making their stocks attractive for income-focused investors. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best dividend stocks from the energy sector.

The first six months of 2024 would be crucial as this time period will decide whether or not the Fed’s long battle against inflation was successful. After all, Powell does not want to repeat the central bank’s mistake of 1967, where it was too quick to cut rates, only to see the inflation monster come back.

If you want to skip all the updates about Bill Gates and want to skip to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Bill Gates Stocks Other Billionaires Are Also Piling Into. ', ""Bill Gates is one of the richest people in the world. His current net worth sits at a whopping $110 billion according to Forbes Magazine, ensuring that Mr. Gates might not run out of money for the rest of his life. The secret to his wealth is identifying the disruptive potential of a graphical user interface (GUI) used to control a computer. Mr. Gates and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s co founder Steve Jobs witnessed GUI in real time, and the rest is history that has seen a mouse or a track pad under everyone's hands."", 'These days, Bill Gates is busy with another revolutionary technology. If, after looking at the stock market in 2022 you decided to relocate under a rock, 2023 has been defined by artificial intelligence. Often thought to be under the domain of science fiction, A.I. systems are now making their way to consumers and companies and have injected stocks of companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with steroids.', ""At the heart of the current A.I. revolution is OpenAI. The San Francisco, California based firm's ChatGPT caught the public imagination after its release, and OpenAI's GPT-4 A.I. model is believed to be one of the most advanced models of its kind in the world. However, before OpenAI became a household name, it was eagerly developing its software and consulting with Mr. Gates. While you might believe A.I. is all hype and no substance, Mr. Gates begs to differ. His first foray with GUIs in 1980 had stunned him into action, and according to him, A.I. is the second time in his life that he has come across such a technology."", ""Don't believe us? Well, take a look at what Mr. Gates wrote in March 2023:"", 'The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface—the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows. I sat with the person who had shown me the demo, a brilliant programmer named Charles Simonyi, and we immediately started brainstorming about all the things we could do with such a user-friendly approach to computing. Charles eventually joined Microsoft, Windows became the backbone of Microsoft, and the thinking we did after that demo helped set the company’s agenda for the next 15 years.', 'The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team from OpenAI since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.', ""Safe to say, if Bill Gates thinks that A.I. in 2023 is the biggest disruptor in the technology industry since the point and click principle of today's operating systems, then there might be more to the technology than A.I.'s biggest detractors believe. However, another individual that has played a key role in today's A.I. wave is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Mr. Musk is one of OpenA's original followers, and after Gates shared in March that A.I. was the second biggest surprise of his career, Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his opinion that Gates' understanding of A.I. was limited back when OpenAI's earliest meetings took place in 2016 and that his knowledge is still limited."", ""Yet, since his retirement from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Gates has been dabbling in a lot more industries apart from A.I. His foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invests in publicly traded companies and awards grants to others that have the potential of solving the world's greatest problems such as hunger, renewable energy, and disease. One such firm that Mr. Gates himself founded is TerraPower. He set up the company in 2008 and still continues to serve as its chairman. TerraPower is a nuclear power company that is developing next generation nuclear reactors that are called traveling wave reactors (TRWs). Conventional nuclear reactors cannot just use uranium that's been mined from the ground. Instead, uranium is enriched first, which creates an entirely new supply chain. TRWs plan to use un-enriched uranium, and TerraPower scored a win at the COP28 conference held in the U.A.E. as the U.A.E.'s state owned nuclear firm ENEC shared that it has signed an MOU with TerraPower to invest the deployment of advanced reactors in the U.A.E. and globally."", ""So, as 2024 comes to a close, seems like Bill Gates can't do anything wrong. Therefore, we thought to take a look at which of his other stock picks are also popular among billionaire investors. Some notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E, with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate). This equates to a mere 3.3% - 3.7% earnings yield.', 'Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 - 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.', 'I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors - even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022.

If you want to skip our introduction to Mr. Dalio, his latest moves, and recent stock market news, then you should check out 5 Best Ray Dalio Stocks Other Billionaires Are Also Piling Into. ', ""Ray Dalio is a guru in the finance industry and one of the richest people in the world. His latest net worth is estimated to sit at $15.4 billion, which makes him one of the richest investment managers around. Additionally, Mr. Dalio's financial firm, Bridgewater Associates operates an investment portfolio that is worth billions of dollars. Insider Monkey's research, which looked at the total value of the fund's investment holdings filed with the SEC, discovered that Bridgewater's third quarter of 2023 investment portfolio was worth $16.5 billion - almost equal to the net worth of Mr. Dalio himself!"", ""The billionaire investor is also one of the oldest in the world - not because of his age but because of the time that has elapsed since he started to invest. Ray Dalio's first stock purchase came when he was just 12 years old. He started investing after working at a golf club where he regularly interacted with Wall Street Professionals. Dalio would continue to invest throughout his school days, after which he would first get a bachelor's degree in finance and then secure his MBA from the illustrious Harvard Business School."", ""His first professional stint in the finance industry would see Mr. Dalio turn his focus towards commodities instead of stocks and two years after graduating from Harvard, he set up Bridgewater Associates. Bridgewater is one of the biggest financial firms in the world, and its assets under management (AUM) stood at $126 billion as of June 202 end. When compared to other hedge funds that primarily employ strategies such as long/short, Bridgewater focuses on broader economic trends and their impacts on the stock market. In today's environment, which has seen interest rates sit at record high levels and markets suffer the consequences, this strategy is quite relevant."", ""Bridgewater's size and scale place it right at the top of the world's financial experts and the firm regularly shares its insights with outsiders through research newsletters. In 2023, the hottest technology was artificial intelligence which caught the public imagination and took analysts and investors by storm. A.I., simply put, is a collection of math formulas that sift through data to form conclusions. This makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications such as drug discovery, fraud detection, and supply chain management. The potential for A.I. to be ubiquitous is a major reason why A.I. related stocks have soared this year with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by 231% year to date."", 'Bridgewater\'s co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen shared the progress that his firm\'s Artificial Intelligence Associate (AIA) labs have made when it comes to analyzing A.I.\'s disruptive potential. His conclusions boil down to what several folks already understand about A.I. The research shows that A.I. has overcome the ability to perform on difficult aptitude tests such as the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). However, Bridgewater shares that while A.I. can perform well on the tests, it is still limited when it comes to making the decisions that the professionals working in the field would make. However, the financial firm is also bullish on A.I. as it notes that these limitations will be overcome over the next couple of years, and by then A.I. might very well perform better than humans can on several ""cognitive applications"".', 'The firm goes on to see what impact A.I. can have on white collar applications and it adds:', 'If AI can perform economically valuable cognitive tasks at very little marginal cost, it could similarly open up new horizons for spending and economic activity. The selling prices of many products will likely fall as AI brings their marginal costs down to zero, even where firms have strong pricing power (as these firms will often maximize profits by increasing sales volumes at lower prices).', 'In some cases, we will see a “Model T effect”: consumers buying a lot more when the price of a previously unaffordable item is slashed, causing entire new industries to spring up. Around the turn of the 20th century, the revolutionary assembly line process used to produce the Ford Model T lowered the cost of manufacturing a car so much (and so quickly) that a whole new market for mass-market cars came into being. AI could similarly make a host of previously high-cost items very cheap to provide, such as tailored legal advice, customized software builds, individualized financial planning, and one-on-one tutoring. Consumption of these kinds of cognitive services could balloon, though pricing power considerations will ultimately determine whether the gains end up primarily with providers as profits or consumers as surplus.', ""Switching gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen investors grow increasingly optimistic about the Fed finally reducing interest rates.

Particularly, we will be paying attention to D.R.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for D.R.

Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To start with, D.R. Horton's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 16% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, D.R. Horton was able to see an impressive net income growth of 29% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio."", ""We then performed a comparison between D.R.

Horton's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 6.9% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (93%) of its profits. So it looks like D.R. Horton is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth."", ""Besides, D.R. Horton has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 8.4% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with D.R. Horton's performance.

We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.

Efforts to diversify its portfolio and strengthen its mixed-use assets, backed by a solid balance sheet, seem encouraging for long-term growth. However, higher e-commerce adoption, tenant bankruptcies and macroeconomic uncertainties raise concerns. High interest rates add to its woes.', ""Federal Realty owns properties in the first-ring suburbs of the nine major metropolitan markets of the United States, mainly in the key coastal markets from Washington D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Given the solid demographics and infill nature of its properties, the company experiences decent leasing activity, aiding occupancy growth.During the third quarter, FRT signed 105 leases for 565,496 square feet of retail space. Occupancy rates in the portfolio increased by 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 92.3% as of Sep 30, 2023. With solid consumer spending and the rebound in the retail industry, this trend is likely to continue. We estimate the leased occupancy rate for 2023 to be 94.2%.The company enjoys a well-diversified tenant base of retailers, including industry bellwethers like TJX Companies, Ahold Delhaize and CVS Corporation. This limits the company’s risk to any particular retail industry and positions it well for experiencing a stable source of rental revenues. As of Sep 30, 2023, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.70% of the annualized base rent (“ABR”) and the top 25 tenants accounted for only 24.32% of the ABR. For 2023, we estimate the company’s rental income to grow 5.3% year over year.Federal Realty’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with residential and office properties are likely to pay off well. Exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, will enable the company to tap into growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Its expansion efforts into premium markets and initiatives to redevelop and repurpose its assets seem encouraging. As of third-quarter 2023 end, throughout the portfolio, it has redevelopment projects underway, with an estimated total cost of approximately $228 million, which it expects to stabilize over the next several years.Federal Realty focuses on maintaining a decent balance sheet position with ample liquidity. The company exited third-quarter 2023 with $1.3 billion of total liquidity in cash and credit facility. The annualized net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6 as of Sep 30, 2023.Federal Realty’s credit ratings of BBB+ and Baa1 from Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively, render it access to the debt market at favorable costs. Hence, with a solid financial footing, FRT seems well-placed to bank on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 8.7%, almost in line with the industry's growth of 8.8%. Analysts seem bullish with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 funds from operations (“FFO”) per share being revised marginally upward over the past month to $6.55."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among customers. Consequently, this is expected to adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and affect Federal Realty.Amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent in the coming quarters. Also, the likelihood of tenant bankruptcies in the near term could affect the company’s profitability and hurt occupancy.Given the prevailing high interest rate environment, Federal Realty may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. We anticipate a year-over-year rise of 24.5% in the company’s interest expenses in 2023.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are NNN REIT, Inc. NNN and Tanger Inc. SKT.

Bridgewater is one of the biggest financial firms in the world, and its assets under management (AUM) stood at $126 billion as of June 202 end. When compared to other hedge funds that primarily employ strategies such as long/short, Bridgewater focuses on broader economic trends and their impacts on the stock market. In today's environment, which has seen interest rates sit at record high levels and markets suffer the consequences, this strategy is quite relevant."", ""Bridgewater's size and scale place it right at the top of the world's financial experts and the firm regularly shares its insights with outsiders through research newsletters. In 2023, the hottest technology was artificial intelligence which caught the public imagination and took analysts and investors by storm. A.I., simply put, is a collection of math formulas that sift through data to form conclusions. This makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications such as drug discovery, fraud detection, and supply chain management. The potential for A.I. to be ubiquitous is a major reason why A.I. related stocks have soared this year with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by 231% year to date."", 'Bridgewater\'s co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen shared the progress that his firm\'s Artificial Intelligence Associate (AIA) labs have made when it comes to analyzing A.I.\'s disruptive potential.

The research shows that A.I. has overcome the ability to perform on difficult aptitude tests such as the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). However, Bridgewater shares that while A.I. can perform well on the tests, it is still limited when it comes to making the decisions that the professionals working in the field would make. However, the financial firm is also bullish on A.I. as it notes that these limitations will be overcome over the next couple of years, and by then A.I. might very well perform better than humans can on several ""cognitive applications"".', 'The firm goes on to see what impact A.I. can have on white collar applications and it adds:', 'If AI can perform economically valuable cognitive tasks at very little marginal cost, it could similarly open up new horizons for spending and economic activity. The selling prices of many products will likely fall as AI brings their marginal costs down to zero, even where firms have strong pricing power (as these firms will often maximize profits by increasing sales volumes at lower prices).', 'In some cases, we will see a “Model T effect”: consumers buying a lot more when the price of a previously unaffordable item is slashed, causing entire new industries to spring up. Around the turn of the 20th century, the revolutionary assembly line process used to produce the Ford Model T lowered the cost of manufacturing a car so much (and so quickly) that a whole new market for mass-market cars came into being. AI could similarly make a host of previously high-cost items very cheap to provide, such as tailored legal advice, customized software builds, individualized financial planning, and one-on-one tutoring. Consumption of these kinds of cognitive services could balloon, though pricing power considerations will ultimately determine whether the gains end up primarily with providers as profits or consumers as surplus.', ""Switching gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen investors grow increasingly optimistic about the Fed finally reducing interest rates.

Bridgewater is one of the biggest financial firms in the world, and its assets under management (AUM) stood at $126 billion as of June 202 end. When compared to other hedge funds that primarily employ strategies such as long/short, Bridgewater focuses on broader economic trends and their impacts on the stock market. In today's environment, which has seen interest rates sit at record high levels and markets suffer the consequences, this strategy is quite relevant."", ""Bridgewater's size and scale place it right at the top of the world's financial experts and the firm regularly shares its insights with outsiders through research newsletters. In 2023, the hottest technology was artificial intelligence which caught the public imagination and took analysts and investors by storm. A.I., simply put, is a collection of math formulas that sift through data to form conclusions. This makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications such as drug discovery, fraud detection, and supply chain management. The potential for A.I. to be ubiquitous is a major reason why A.I. related stocks have soared this year with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by 231% year to date."", 'Bridgewater\'s co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen shared the progress that his firm\'s Artificial Intelligence Associate (AIA) labs have made when it comes to analyzing A.I.\'s disruptive potential. His conclusions boil down to what several folks already understand about A.I. The research shows that A.I. has overcome the ability to perform on difficult aptitude tests such as the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). However, Bridgewater shares that while A.I. can perform well on the tests, it is still limited when it comes to making the decisions that the professionals working in the field would make. However, the financial firm is also bullish on A.I. as it notes that these limitations will be overcome over the next couple of years, and by then A.I. might very well perform better than humans can on several ""cognitive applications"".', 'The firm goes on to see what impact A.I. can have on white collar applications and it adds:', 'If AI can perform economically valuable cognitive tasks at very little marginal cost, it could similarly open up new horizons for spending and economic activity. The selling prices of many products will likely fall as AI brings their marginal costs down to zero, even where firms have strong pricing power (as these firms will often maximize profits by increasing sales volumes at lower prices).', 'In some cases, we will see a “Model T effect”: consumers buying a lot more when the price of a previously unaffordable item is slashed, causing entire new industries to spring up. Around the turn of the 20th century, the revolutionary assembly line process used to produce the Ford Model T lowered the cost of manufacturing a car so much (and so quickly) that a whole new market for mass-market cars came into being. AI could similarly make a host of previously high-cost items very cheap to provide, such as tailored legal advice, customized software builds, individualized financial planning, and one-on-one tutoring. Consumption of these kinds of cognitive services could balloon, though pricing power considerations will ultimately determine whether the gains end up primarily with providers as profits or consumers as surplus.', ""Switching gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen investors grow increasingly optimistic about the Fed finally reducing interest rates.
