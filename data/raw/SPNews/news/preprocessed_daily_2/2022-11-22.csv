Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$151m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabNotably, that recent sale by Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab was not the only time they sold Charles Schwab shares this year. Earlier in the year, they fetched US$69.43 per share in a -US$19m sale. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$80.00). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 0.2% of Charles Schwab's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Charles Schwab shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Charles Schwab better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Charles Schwab shares. In total, insiders sold US$48m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Charles Schwab Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Charles Schwab insiders own 6.4% of the company, worth about US$9.5b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Charles Schwab stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Charles Schwab makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Charles Schwab has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The sensing solution is created using a new patented approach to differentiate its performance from competitors and provide high speed and accuracy to industrial applications with robotics technology.The solution will aid in reducing design time and the number of external components required to manufacture the product, thus decreasing launch time to market and effectively lowering operating costs.The latest launch reflects the company’s strategy to invest heavily in building its intelligent power and sensing products to help address key high-growth megatrends in automotive, industrial and plug power.In the third quarter, despite ongoing market volatility, onsemi’s automotive and industrial revenues accounted for 49.1% of its overall business and combined grew 38% year over year. This was driven by the adoption of intelligent power and sensing solutions in the markets like automotive due to the electric vehicle (EV) megatrend.Due to rising inflation, customers will look for sensing solutions that provide high efficiency within lower production time to decrease operating costs, specifically in high-margin business opportunities like robotics. Its latest sensing solutions will aid onsemi in attracting new clients and aid top-line growth.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Addressing Megatrends to Boost Bottom LineON stock, which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has risen 6.7% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry’s and Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 15.7% and 32%, respectively.The entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to the macro-economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesonsemi has been able to beat the cyclical downtrend by investing in strategic areas like intelligent power and sensing, which helps it to grow its gross and operating margins.The launch of onsemi’s latest sensing solutions comes right after the company approved to further direct its investments to high-growth margin business segments, which is expected to boost its bottom-line growth.This has aided ON’s third-quarter 2022 earnings, which surged 87% year over year to $1.45. It is looking to bank on this strategy further in the coming quarters.onsemi is also expanding its silicon carbide (SiC) facility in Hudson, NH. The new hub will increase ON’s SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year and address certain supply-chain bottlenecks. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 33%.Further, positively impacting onsemi’s decision to expand operations in high-growth markets was President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act in late August 2022, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China. Onsemi peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances.  MCHP continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are a chief competitor of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight. This helps STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid EVs and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.However, onsemi expects demand to continue outpacing supply in the fourth quarter of 2022. With the recent focus on high-growth margin business segments, onsemi can address the rising supply-chain issues, distinguishing its services from its competitors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that STM's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.58, while TXN has a forward P/E of 18.89. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 1.92. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.02.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 3.17. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TXN has a P/B of 10.96.Based on these metrics and many more, STM holds a Value grade of A, while TXN has a Value grade of C.STM sticks out from TXN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that STM is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 6.56, while its industry has an average P/E of 11.94. UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 4.48, with a median of 6.25, all within the past year.We should also highlight that UNM has a P/B ratio of 0.94. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.56. Over the past year, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.41, with a median of 0.65.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.68. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.92.Finally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.63. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. UNM's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 7.28. Within the past 12 months, UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.63 and as low as 4.67, with a median of 5.69.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Unum Group is likely being undervalued right now.

(NYSE:TMO) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Thermo Fisher Scientific could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Thermo Fisher Scientific.Does Growth Match The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Thermo Fisher Scientific's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 17%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 99% in total over the last three years. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 8.9% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 8.9% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's curious that Thermo Fisher Scientific's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Thermo Fisher Scientific's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Our examination of Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Thermo Fisher Scientific that we have uncovered.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy. The sharp decline in the stock market has investors and economists worried about the risks of a possible recession. According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance.

Revenue grew 21% and EPS grew 32% in the most recent reported quarter, and strong payment activity has persisted despite high inflation. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and was likely driven by adverse foreign exchange movements and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending.

These stakes are collectively worth over $848.3 million.Oakmark Funds mentioned Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

15,a876356f-6682-33ab-ad18-16a16684f9a0,WMT,2022-11-22,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Walmart (WMT) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005300.html,1669050005,STORY,['WMT'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Walmart (WMT), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Walmart currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for WMT that show why this world's largest retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For WMT, shares are up 1.14% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry is up 0.39% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.82% compares favorably with the industry's 7.45% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Walmart have risen 14.16%, and are up 5.51% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -7.06% and -14.34%, respectively.Investors should also take note of WMT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, WMT is averaging 7,263,863 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with WMT.Over the past two months, 15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost WMT's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.84 to $6.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 4 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that WMT is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Walmart on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Spark Good Round Up, which launched this fall, allows customers to choose the approved nonprofit they’d like to donate to and set up easy recurring Round Ups on the Walmart app or online.To incentivize customers and nonprofits to take part in the campaign, Walmart is awarding up to 3,000 nonprofits a $1,000 grant when they receive 20 or more Spark Good Round Up donations, for a total contribution of up to $3 million.Participating is easy. After a customer checks out while shopping online or in the app, they will be prompted to search for a favorite charity for their round up donations. Customers can also go to Walmart.com/SparkGood and search for the charity of their choice to receive their Round Up contributions.""Last year, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave more than $1.5 billion in cash and in-kind donations to organizations around the world,"" said Erin Hogue, a senior director of associate and customer engagement at Walmart. ""Giving is in our DNA and it’s clear our customers feel the same. With this $5 million campaign, we’re not only amplifying our customers’ acts of giving through matching donations and grants, we’re also allowing our customers to tell us where they’d like the dollars to go.""The Spark Good Round Up campaign has a number of nonprofits – big and small – for customers to choose. But if a customer can’t find the local cause they want to support, they can send a referral link directly to the 501(c)(3) of their choice.Story continuesSpark Good, Walmart’s newest giving initiative, brings the retailer’s nonprofit tools together under one umbrella. From local grant opportunities to registries for their most-needed items, Spark Good gives nonprofits one convenient place to work with Walmart in making a difference in local communities.Together, we can Spark Good this holiday season.

(Photo by DAVID GANNON/AFP via Getty Images)Projections from the American Gaming Association match that sentiment. The association is estimating that $1.8 billion will be wagered on the World Cup. That comes in significantly behind previous estimates for the 2022 March Madness tournament ($3.1 billion) and Super Bowl ($7.61 billion).Notably, the World Cup and March Madness have a similar structure. The college basketball tournament spans roughly a month and consists of 67 games played throughout that time, including on weekdays. The World Cup will take a similar format, with 64 games played across a variety of time slots.But there will be key differences for U.S. betting operations. For starters, soccer isn’t as popular in the American sports landscape as college athletics or the current pro offerings from the NFL and NBA, both of which will be active during the upcoming weeks, according to FanDuel CEO Amy Howe.“The players just aren't as well known so sometimes that doesn't translate to as big of a betting activity,” Howe told Yahoo Finance.The time change will also add an element of uncertainty to this year’s tournament. Qatar is eight hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, meaning that many of the tournament's matches will take place in the morning — in some cases before sunrise — on the East Coast.Story continuesArgentina, the most bet-on country to win the World Cup on Caesars (CZR), will kick off its first game at 5:00 a.m. ET next Tuesday.“The honest answer is we'll see how it plays out,” Howe said. “The time zone differences do hurt you a little bit.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.But there will be plenty of advantages for betting platforms throughout the tournament. Ken Fuchs, the head of sports at Caesars, pointed out that time zone differences could work to sportsbooks' advantage at certain points. With popular teams like the U.S. and Brazil playing midday games during the Thanksgiving holiday week, sportsbooks will have added inventory during typically quiet hours for sports.Soccer also provides a different value proposition for bettors, Aitken argued. With so many Americans not as versed in watching a full 90-minute game with limited scoring, bettors are likely to explore live bet options on predictions such as who will earn the next free kick or whether a goal will be scored in a five-minute period. PointsBet is anticipating those live markets could account for 80% of the betting throughout the tournament.“Making it easier for a broader audience to engage with the sport by having these sorts of lightning bet propositions will definitely work,” Aitken said. “We've seen that with a sport like tennis.”Fuchs argued that regardless of time zones and game days, the teams that advance will be the key indicators of sportsbook handles throughout the tournament. Just as bettors flock to Tiger Woods during golf tournaments no matter how big of an underdog he is, U.S. sports bettors are backing the home team during the World Cup.At Caesars, the U.S. is the second-best team wagered to win the World Cup and holds 13% of the overall money wagered on a potential winner.“Anytime that you have a big event like this, if the home team, the U.S., performs well, people will want to latch on to that and they will bet it,” Fuchs said. “It can be an incremental opportunity from a sportsbook standpoint.”Josh is a reporter and producer for Yahoo Finance.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Republicans will have a slim majority in the House of Representatives. That will have the practical effect of gumming up the already slow-moving gears of government. For those looking for stocks to buy, this can certainly make things a bit more difficult.Finding out what this means for an individual investor’s strategy, including which stocks to buy and sell is important. My short answer may not be very satisfying. In 2023, I think investors will need to continue executing many of the same strategies that have worked this year. Inflation may be peaking, but still has to come down. That means interest rates are likely to keep going up.Accordingly, all of us so-called retail investors are caught in the middle of this uncertainty hoping for better days ahead. However, as the saying goes, hope isn’t a strategy. So, I’ll offer another thought. Buy stocks that have a story. In this case, stocks that are part of sectors that are likely to move higher due to trends in the broader economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this article, I offer seven such stocks to buy. These are companies with compelling stories that don’t depend on government stimulus to thrive.XOMExxon Mobil$112.08CRWDCrowdStrike$138.99CHPTChargePoint Holdings$12.45KFYKorn Ferry$56.42MGMMGM International$36.74EXPEExpedia Group$98.31PSAPublic Storage$293.51Exxon Mobil (XOM)A view of a well-lit Exxon Mobil gas station in Pasadena, CA during nighttime. representing exxon mobil stockSource: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.comLeading off this list of stocks to buy is Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), but perhaps not for the reason you may think. Yes, oil is likely to move higher in 2023. And that will mean another quarter or two of good earnings. This might continue to inflame rhetoric about obscene profits in the political class. But that rhetoric is short-sighted, and if you’ll indulge me for a minute, I’ll explain why.Story continuesAs our nation lurches towards a renewable energy future, there’s an irony that can’t be overstated. That is that traditional fossil fuel companies like Exxon Mobil, BP (NYSE:BP) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), to name a few, are well-positioned to help develop renewable energy solutions. These companies saw the writing on the wall decades ago and were never going to be left without a seat at the table.Exxon Mobil is using some of its fortress balance sheet to invest in clean energy initiatives. Bet you won’t hear about that in Washington. I won’t deny that in the short-term, XOM stock should benefit investors with capital appreciation based on the laws of supply and demand that govern the oil market. But as a long-term holding, investors shouldn’t ignore the company’s investments into renewable energy.CrowdStrike (CRWD)A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logoSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comIn 2023, companies will continue to cut expenses wherever they can. However, one area that is likely to avoid the chopping block is cybersecurity. The last few years has made cybersecurity a top priority for every company. And it’s a well-known fact that the political class is well aware of the threats that cyberattack costs pose to businesses.Thus, because the nature of online threats is always changing, cybersecurity should remain one of the best sectors for investors in 2023. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers cloud-native solutions that allow companies to move their existing security protocols. This makes the company an ideal choice for the move towards hybrid work.I won’t pretend that this CRWD stock has an ideal valuation. For example, market analysts project the company’s valuation at 80-times forward earnings. But the consensus opinion of analysts gives the stock a price target of about $240, which would provide upside of over 70% at the time of this writing.ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT)EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.Source: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.comThe transition to electric vehicles continues to gain momentum. Many automakers that are not named Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have launched electric vehicles, and more are on the way. But there has to be a massive infrastructure built to reduce range anxiety. ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is on the forefront of this transition, which is why it’s one of the stocks to buy for 2023.The bearish argument against this company is that the need for publicly accessible charging stations is overstated, because many current EV owners are charging at home. But the bullish side of this chicken-and-egg argument could be that the reason they charge at home is because there are not enough publicly accessible charging stations to service them.Time will tell, and I won’t insult you and say that CHPT stock is low-risk investment. The EV sector is only in its early innings, and a range of outcomes is still possible for a company that hasn’t generated a dime of profit. That said, ChargePoint stands to benefit from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. The Republican House members may try to block future spending, but it’s unlikely they’ll try to rein in the money that’s already been approved.Korn Ferry (KFY)Next on this list of stocks to buy is a company that literally tries to relieve uncertainty. Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY) is a “global organizational consulting firm” that is likely to be in high demand in 2023.One of the confusing narratives of 2022 has been how well the labor market has held up. But, at least in the tech sector, that is quickly changing. Most of the largest names in the sector have announced hiring freezes and/or layoffs.That said, eventually these companies will begin to take a critical look at their organizations and make plans to ensure they have the right talent for the right jobs. And if they turn to Korn Ferry, they may benefit from the company’s Intelligence Cloud which uses AI data-driven insights to help its clients understand its current workforce and assess its hiring needs.That thesis would please investors, who have seen the stock fall 26% in 2022 despite the fact that it is delivering year-over-year increases in both revenue and earnings. And if it’s accurate, KFY stock may head back to the all-time high it set in late 2021.MGM International (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM International (NYSE:MGM) picked a bad time to launch their Bet MGM Sportbook and mobile app. BetMGM was set to launch right as March Madness was ready tip off in 2020. We all know what happened next. However, live sports are back with no pandemic restrictions.That is allowing the sports betting sector to resume its strong growth trend . And there’s more growth expected in 2023. Currently, 30 states have legalized sports betting, and more are on the way. But the industry will remain hamstrung to an extent until all 50 states legalize sports betting. That will take some time because it’s a highly regulated industry.Despite the regulatory hurdles, MGM has a lot of competition in this space. But in a volatile market, that may work to the company’s benefit. MGM has an existing portfolio of casinos helping to drive revenue as they continue to grow their sportsbook business.Expedia Group (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comExpedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) is a mirror into the psyche of investors. In 2021, EXPE stock soared as the hope of vaccines stirred the pent-up demand for travel. However, it’s been a different story in 2022, as investors’ concerns about inflation and a possible recession are weighing on the stock, which has nearly been cut in half.This is despite the fact that the online booking company continues to grow its revenue and earnings on a year-over-year basis. That speaks to the fact that travel demand remains strong. That said, it has to taper off, right? Maybe?Then again, maybe not. As remote and/or hybrid work is becoming both normalized and preferred, it’s blurring the lines between leisure and business travel. Many people are realizing that with the right setting, they can achieve both. Or at least give it a great try.Thus, instead of buying airline stocks, hotel stocks, or cruise line stocks, you can invest in Expedia Group which helps consumers manage their entire trip.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLast on this list of stocks to buy is Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). This company is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on the self-storage industry. I’d encourage you to read this article from Ian Bezek that outlines how the company is uniquely positioned to profit from rising interest rates.I’ll be more simplistic, but it will be in keeping with the focus of this article. The pandemic has stirred a desire for people to live where they want. And while some individuals are moving to an area with a cheaper cost of living, others are moving to areas where they need their paycheck to stretch further.That may mean smaller living spaces, which means they’ll need a place to store their stuff. And that means that demand for storage units will remain strong.These are businesses with high margins. My lived experience can attest to rising rates being a reality of being a customer. It’s going to take more to store our stuff. And most of us will pay it.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

27,dd58f012-1d91-36ae-a11c-4a637eadaa9d,IT,2022-11-22,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Gartner a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-133001114.html,1669037401,STORY,"['ACGL', 'ACGLP']","[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Arch Capital Group (ACGL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ACGL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Arch Capital Group's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Arch Capital Group's main business drivers.Established in 1995 and headquartered in Pembroke, Bermuda, Arch Capital Group Ltd. offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance across the world. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurer provides a wide range of products and services, which include primary and excess casualty coverages, professional indemnity,  workers compensation and umbrella liability and employers  liability insurance coverages to name a few. The company offers a full range of property, casualty and mortgage insurance and reinsurance lines, while maintaining focus on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance.Arch Capital classifies its operations into three underwriting segments and two other operating segments (non-underwriting). The underwriting segments are Insurance, Reinsurance and Mortgage. The other two operating (non-underwriting) segments are ‘Other’ and Corporate.The Insurance (47% of 2021 gross premiums written) segment provides primary and excess casualty coverages, loss sensitive primary casualty insurance programs, professional indemnity, and other financial coverages as well as commercial automobile and inland marine products to name a few. This apart the segment deals in property, energy, marine, and aviation insurance, captive insurance programs, employers liability insurance coverages. This segment markets its products through a group of licensed independent retail and wholesale brokers.Reinsurance (40.9%) segment primarily offers reinsurance for third-party liability and workers compensation exposures, reinsurance protection for catastrophic losses and commercial property risks; life reinsurance, risk management solutions accident and health, workers compensation catastrophe to name a few. This segment markets its reinsurance products through brokers, and directly to ceding companies.Mortgage (12.1%) segment provides private mortgage insurance covering one-to-four family residential mortgages; mortgage insurance to cover previously originated residential loans; quota share reinsurance; and risk-sharing products. This segment sells its products directly as well as through brokers to its bank and credit union customers.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Arch Capital Group ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $4,250.86, or a gain of 325.09%, as of January 11, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 166.23% and gold's return of 8.49% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for ACGL.Arch Capital boasts a strong product portfolio and has been maintaining an exemplary track record of premium growth. Premiums should benefit from new business opportunities; rate increases, growth in existing accounts and growth in Australian single premium mortgage insurance. This apart, it has been diversifying its Mortgage Insurance business via strategic acquisitions that also complement the strength in the specialty insurance and reinsurance businesses. Solid capital position shields it from market volatility. A solid inorganic growth story offers diversification. Shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. We expect 2022 operating EPS to increase 11.1% on 15.7% higher operatung revenues. However, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility. High costs concerns. Low investment rate should keep investment yields under pressure.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.29%, and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The dollar came under pressure in particular against the euro and the yen, which rose by 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.""On the Fed side, tomorrow’s minutes will be important to watch, but the recent Fedspeak has undoubtedly added a layer of caution to the dovish pivot enthusiasm, which could mean investors may also be more reluctant to over-interpret dovish signals from the minutes,"" ING strategist Francesco Pesole said.Story continuesMeanwhile, the OECD said on Tuesday the global economy should avoid a recession next year, but that the worst energy crisis since the 1970s will lead to a sharp slowdown that will hit Europe the hardest.Still, analysts at National Australia Bank questioned whether demand for the U.S. currency would last.""Evidence U.S. inflation has peaked and can fall significantly in 2023, together with China and Europe developments, convince us a USD depreciation cycle is now in train,"" they said in a note on Tuesday.U.S. Treasury yields eased across most maturities ahead of Wednesday's minutes.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 3.80%, while the two-year note yield also fell 3 bps to 4.50%.Oil rose on Tuesday, a day after Saudi Arabia denied a media report that it was discussing an increase in oil supply with OPEC and its allies.Brent crude futures rose 1.4% to $88.64 a barrel, having fallen by as much as 6% the previous day, before Saudi Arabia issued its denial and stemmed the decline.""Markets remain subject to even greater volatility due to a total dearth of market liquidity, as was all too evident in crude oil futures, as they plunged on the WSJ story suggesting Saudi Arabia may propose a very surprising increase in OPEC production at the December meeting, only to fully reverse when this was denied,"" ADM Investor Services chief global economist Marc Ostwald said.Spot gold broke four days of losses, rising 0.2% to trade at $1,741.40 an ounce.(Reporting by Selena Li in Hong Kong, additional reportng by Kevin Buckland in Tokyo; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Bernadette Baum)]"

Beijing shut parks, shopping malls and museums while more Chinese cities resumed mass testing for COVID-19 as the country reported new infections near April's peaks.Although Hong Kong stocks took another outsize hit, downbeat world markets were more mixed on Tuesday as ebbing oil prices - weighed down by China's woes and world recession fears - went on a wild rollercoaster ride over the past 24 hours.Brent crude plunged more than 5% to 10-month lows of $82 per barrel at one point late on Monday amid reports OPEC was considering lifting output. But Saudi denials saw it regain all those losses since and it hovered about $88 first thing today.The U.S. dollar also gave back some of Monday's sharp gains. San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly struck a more measured note on Fed tightening by saying on Monday that the real-world impact of the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes is likely greater than what its short-term rate target implies.Pain in the crypto world continued, with many investors fearing the fallout from the collapse of exchange FTX is just beginning.Bitcoin - which is now down almost 80% over the past year - dropped to a two-year low of $15,481 late Monday. Analysts estimate more than 55% of all the money ever invested in the leading cryptocurrency is now underwater.Story continuesInvestigations, recriminations and lawsuits across the crypto sector continued. Cryptocurrency lender Genesis said on Monday it has no immediate plans to file for bankruptcy, days after the FTX failure forced it to suspend customer redemptions.And another worrying development for anyone involved in the area was a rise of lawsuits against sponsors and advertisers of the failed FTX - a shot across the bow to many celebrities, sports teams and corporate advertisers dabbling in crypto.The Golden State Warriors were sued on Monday by an FTX customer who accused the reigning National Basketball Association champions of fraudulently promoting the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. And Bloomberg News reporters American football star Tom Brady was being probed by Texas regulators.In corporate news, Baidu's third-quarter revenue beat estimates as China's search engine giant benefited from a recovery in online advertising sales and growth in its cloud and artificial intelligence business.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:* Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Nov Non-manufacturing business survey, Richmond Fed Nov business survey, Euro zone Nov consumer confidence* Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Kansas City Fed chief Esther George all speak.* US corporate earnings: Analog Devices, HP, Dollar Tree, Autodesk* U.S. Treasury sells 7-year notes, 2-year floating rate notes(By Mike Dolan, editing by Alexandra Hudson mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

(NYSE: FE) electric company in western Pennsylvania, continues to expand its smart grid in Mercer and Crawford counties to reinforce the local power system and help prevent lengthy service disruptions, especially during severe weather. Work includes installation of new, automated equipment and technology in distribution substations and along neighborhood power lines serving more than 20,000 customers in Sharon, Sharpsville, Hermitage, Transfer, Greenville, West Middlesex, Hartstown, Conneaut and nearby areas.Penn Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The work – expected to be completed in December – is part of Penn Power's second phase Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to help enhance electric service for customers. The company's investments to enhance the local energy grid have successfully reduced the number and length of outages customers experience by up to 20% in areas where work has been completed.""Penn Power has made significant investments in smart grid technologies in recent years, helping enhance our reliability performance and piloting new devices that our sister utilities have since begun to implement successfully within their own service areas,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""We remain committed to modernizing the technology and equipment used to provide safe, dependable electric service to our customers.""Hundreds of homes and businesses in the area will benefit from the installation of nearly 30 new automated reclosing devices in the substations and along neighborhood power lines that will help limit the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions. These electrical devices work like a circuit breaker in a home that shuts off power when trouble occurs, with the added benefit of automatically reenergizing a substation or power line within seconds for certain types of outages to keep power safely flowing to customers. This technology is safer and more efficient because it often allows utility personnel to automatically restore service to customers in lieu of sending a crew to investigate.Story continuesIf the device senses a more serious issue, like a fallen tree on electrical equipment, it will isolate the outage to that area and limit the total number of affected customers. The smart technology will quickly pinpoint the location of the fault and help utility personnel better understand the cause of the outage to help speed restoration.Automated voltage regulators are also being installed to help ensure safe, constant voltage levels along power lines on extremely cold or hot days that create high demand for electricity. In addition to preventing voltage issues for customers, the devices could potentially help provide energy savings by evenly distributing electricity to allow all customers served by a single power line to receive the same flow of safe, reliable power. Lastly, additional power lines are being constructed to provide more flexibility in restoring outages due to events such as storms and vehicle accidents. The new power lines will help reduce the length and overall number of customers impacted during an outage by switching them to a backup line for faster service restoration.This work builds upon system upgrades that were completed in recent years across Penn Power's service area in Mercer and Crawford counties, including the installation of more than 200 automated reclosing devices in rural, tree-filled communities, and the addition of interior fencing in four substations to help deter climbing animals and protect against electrical equipment interference that can cause power outages.Penn Power serves more than 160,000 customers in all or parts of Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Crawford, Lawrence and Mercer counties in western Pennsylvania. Follow Penn Power on Twitter @Penn_Power, on Facebook at www.facebook.com/PennPower, and online at www.pennpower.com.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

(NYSE:CRM) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.30bUS$7.58bUS$9.28bUS$11.7bUS$13.6bUS$15.1bUS$16.2bUS$17.2bUS$18.0bUS$18.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x27Analyst x27Analyst x14Analyst x7Analyst x5Est @ 10.29%Est @ 7.8%Est @ 6.05%Est @ 4.83%Est @ 3.97% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$5.9kUS$6.6kUS$7.5kUS$8.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.9kUS$9.9kUS$9.8kUS$9.6kUS$9.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$87bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$360bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$360b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$178bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$265b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$145, the company appears quite good value at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.037. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Department of Energy (DOE) confirmed Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (PG&amp;E) Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program.PG&amp;E filed its application for federal funding on September 2, 2022, the same day California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 846 into law, seeking to extend operations at DCPP in San Luis Obispo County for five years beyond its current license expiration in 2025. The plant would be used to improve statewide energy system reliability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while additional renewable energy and carbon-free resources come online.Last month, the state authorized a loan of up to $1.4 billion from the Department of Water Resources to PG&amp;E to support extending operations at the plant. SB 846 further directed PG&amp;E to pursue funds from DOE, and any other potentially available federal funds, to pay back the loan and lower costs for customers should the plant’s operating license be extended.""This is another very positive step forward to extend the operating life of Diablo Canyon Power Plant to ensure electrical reliability for all Californians,"" said PG&amp;E Corporation Chief Executive Officer Patti Poppe. ""While there are key federal and state approvals remaining before us in this multi-year process, we remain focused on continuing to provide reliable, low-cost, carbon-free energy to the people of California, while safely operating one of the top performing plants in the country.""PG&amp;E has been conditionally awarded a total of approximately $1.1 billion from the DOE. Final award amounts will be determined following completion of each year of the award period, and amounts awarded will be based on actual costs.Story continues""This is a critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation’s largest source of clean electricity,"" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M.

Diablo is the last operating nuclear plant in California.The Biden administration believes nuclear power is critical in curbing climate change and wants to keep plants open ahead of the development of next-generation reactors. President Joe Biden wants to decarbonize the power grid by 2035.The U.S. nuclear power industry's 92 reactors generate more than half of the country's virtually carbon-free electricity. But about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas.U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the grant was a ""critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation's largest source of clean electricity.""PG&amp;E Chief Executive Patti Poppe told Reuters earlier this month that the company is applying to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a license to allow Diablo to continue operating. Poppe said the plant is also ordering more uranium fuel for the reactor, and dry casks for storing nuclear waste.""There have been constraints on access to uranium,"" following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Poppe said.EARTHQUAKE RISKCritics of keeping open the 2,240-Megawatt Diablo Canyon plant, located next to the Pacific Ocean in San Luis Obispo County, say the region is vulnerable to earthquakes and that there is no permanent place for disposing of radioactive nuclear waste.Story continuesSuzanne Hosn, a PG&amp;E spokesperson, said Diablo can ""safely withstand extreme natural events, including potential earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding.""Hosn pointed to analyses performed in 2015 by the NRC after the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan that was slammed by a tsunami, releasing radioactive materials and forcing the evacuation of some 80,000 residents. The NRC said in the 2015 reports that Diablo was safe from tsunamis including ones generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes.""We can protect these facilities and the communities they serve,"" Granholm said.Radioactive waste from nuclear power is currently held in casks and pools on site at plants across the country.

Diablo is the last operating nuclear plant in California.The Biden administration believes nuclear power is critical in curbing climate change and wants to keep plants open ahead of the development of next-generation reactors. President Joe Biden wants to decarbonize the power grid by 2035.The U.S. nuclear power industry's 92 reactors generate more than half of the country's virtually carbon-free electricity. But about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas.U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the grant was a ""critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation's largest source of clean electricity.""PG&amp;E Chief Executive Patti Poppe told Reuters earlier this month that the company is applying to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a license to allow Diablo to continue operating. Poppe said the plant is also ordering more uranium fuel for the reactor, and dry casks for storing nuclear waste.""There have been constraints on access to uranium,"" following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Poppe said.EARTHQUAKE RISKCritics of keeping open the 2,240-Megawatt Diablo Canyon plant, located next to the Pacific Ocean in San Luis Obispo County, say the region is vulnerable to earthquakes and that there is no permanent place for disposing of radioactive nuclear waste.Story continuesSuzanne Hosn, a PG&amp;E spokesperson, said Diablo can ""safely withstand extreme natural events, including potential earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding.""Hosn pointed to analyses performed in 2015 by the NRC after the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan that was slammed by a tsunami, releasing radioactive materials and forcing the evacuation of some 80,000 residents. The NRC said in the 2015 reports that Diablo was safe from tsunamis including ones generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes.""We can protect these facilities and the communities they serve,"" Granholm said.Radioactive waste from nuclear power is currently held in casks and pools on site at plants across the country. The administration of former President Barack Obama killed the multibillion-dollar Yucca Mountain project designed to permanently store nuclear waste underground in Nevada due to local opposition.Some politicians who have been wary of problems associated with nuclear waste have come out in support of the Civil Nuclear Credit program.U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said extending the life of Diablo was necessary for the state to meet its clean energy goals and to deliver reliable power.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy. The sharp decline in the stock market has investors and economists worried about the risks of a possible recession. According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance.

Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

And for millions of us, that means desperately trying to figure out what to get our loved ones. Thankfully, if your favorite people are tech inclined, there are plenty of great options out there. Whether you’re looking for a game console, smartwatch, or some prepaid subscription cards for services like Netflix, I’ve rounded up some of the hottest gift ideas for the 2022 holiday season.My advice: get shopping as soon as you can, because there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to get your hands on these devices for very long.Sony PlayStation 5$499The PlayStation 5 is still one of the most sought after holiday gifts two years after it debuted. (Image: Sony)Oh, baby. If you’ve managed to get your hands on Sony's (SONY) PlayStation 5, you’re either incredibly lucky or incredibly persistent. The PlayStation 5 has been difficult to purchase since it first went on sale in Nov. 2020. System availability is wildly inconsistent thanks to the lingering effects of COVID lockdowns and the global chip shortage.But if you can score a PlayStation 5, you’ll be able to gift one of the most sought after consoles around. With games like “Horizon: Forbidden West,” “God of War Ragnarok,” and “The Last of Us Part 1,” not to mention franchises like “Call of Duty” and “Madden,” the PS5 is a beast of a console. Throw in high-powered graphics, media center capabilities, and game streaming and you’ve got one heck of a gift to give. Or keep for yourself.Microsoft Xbox Series X$499The Xbox Series X is a powerful machine, but it's Microsoft's Game Pass and cloud gaming services that make it a stand-out. (Image: Microsoft)Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox Series X is a bit easier to get this time of year than Sony’s console, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less impressive. The boxy bad boy offers equally powerful graphics, media capabilities, and an expansive array of first-party and third-party games that make it every bit the powerhouse your favorite gamer will love.Then there’s Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Cloud Gaming, which give you access to online gameplay and the ability to stream games to your console via the cloud. Put it all together and the Xbox Series X is easily one of the best choices for the gamer in your life.Story continuesValve Steam Deck$399Valve's Steam Deck lets you take your favorite PC titles on the go. (Image: Valve)The Steam Deck is Valve’s portable gaming system. Think of it as a Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch on steroids, giving you the ability to access your library of Steam games or use it as a kind of portable PC. Sporting a 7-inch display, touchpads, thumbsticks, and shoulder buttons, the Steam Deck promises to get you gaming on the go without the need for a massive gaming laptop.The portable comes in three versions. The $399 model comes with 64GB of storage, while the $529 model has 256GB of speedier storage. The top-of-the-line model gets 512GB of faster storage, anti-glare glass on the display, and a handful of other goodies for $649.Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation)$249The second generation of Apple's AirPods Pro feature improved noise canceling and transparency technologies, updated sound, and touch controls. (Image: Apple)If you’ve got an Apple (AAPL) fan on your holiday shopping list, you can’t really go wrong with the second-generation AirPods Pro. The earbuds feature improved noise cancellation thanks to Apple’s new H2 chip, not to mention better bass than the company’s first-generation AirPods Pro.The second-gen AirPods Pro come with four silicon tips for a customizable fit and provide up to 6 hours of listening time per charge. The charging case offers an additional 30 hours of power. Apple has also added the ability to raise and lower the volume of your music by swiping up and down on the AirPods’ stems.Google Pixel Watch$349The Pixel Watch is Google's first smartwatch, and sports a beautiful design and plenty of fitness tracking features. (Image: Google)Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) first-ever smartwatch, the Pixel Watch is a gorgeous piece of technology featuring a domed, circular display and stainless steel case. Designed specifically for Android users, the watch gives you access to your notifications, texts, the ability to make phone calls, and anything else you’d expect from a smartwatch.What sets the Pixel Watch apart from the competition though is its deep integration with Fitbit’s own fitness capabilities, including sleep tracking and a slew of exercise tracking functions. You’ll have to sign up for Fitbit Premium for $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year to get the most out of the watch including your sleep score, daily readiness score, and long-term health metrics, though.Apple Watch SE/Series 8$249/ $399The Apple Watch Series 8 brings crash detection, as well as an ECG app, and tons of fitness capabilities. (Image: Apple)Apple’s smartwatch is still the best on the market. From its design to its fitness tracking and app integrations, it’s hard to beat the Apple Watch. The company currently offers three versions of the watch: the SE, Series 8, and Ultra. The SE comes with virtually everything you’ll find on the Series 8 save for a temperature sensor, always-on display, and blood oxygen and ECG sensors.Available with a 40mm or 44mm watch face, the SE is a solid smartwatch for the person who wants the functionality of the Apple Watch, but doesn’t need the bells and whistles, or higher price, of the Series 8. If you’re alright spending $150 more on the Series 8, though, you’ll get either a 41mm or 45mm face, always-on display, and aforementioned sensors. If you want the latest and greatest, the Series 8 is the way to go.As for the $799 Apple Watch Ultra, that’s best left to those who are extreme athletes who need a watch that will last days on end and survive extreme climates. Safe to say it’s not for everyone.Google Pixel 7$499The Pixel 7 sports improved AI functionality, updated camera software, comes with Google's Android 13 operating system. (Image: Google)Google’s Pixel 7 is the ultimate expression of what Google believes a smartphone should be. The Android 13-powered device packs a host of AI-powered features, including photo editing and voice translation. The 6.3-inch Pixel 7 includes wide-angle and ultra-wide angle cameras, but thanks to those AI smarts, it can crop in on wide-angle shots to create a virtual 2x zoom.With guaranteed Android software updates hitting as soon as they’re released, the Pixel 7 is the go-to for the Android fan who wants Google’s take on a modern smartphone.Apple iPhone 14 Pro$999With updated camera hardware, an always-on display, and Apple's new Dynamic Island, the iPhone 14 Pro is an impressive smartphone. (Image: Apple)Apple’s iPhone 14 Pro features a triple camera setup, complete with a 3x telephoto zoom and improved low-light performance. This year, Apple equipped the iPhone with automatic crash detection, as well as emergency satellite communication for when you’re lost and off the grid. There’s also the new Dynamic Island, an area of the iPhone’s display that’s designed for scaled-down multitasking like quickly changing your songs in Spotify and checking sports scores.Amazon Echo Dot$25 or $40The Amazon Echo dot gets a new design and built-in digital clock, making it an inexpensive, though no less functional gift. (Image: Amazon)Amazon’s (AMZN) Echo Dot gives you a compact smart speaker with Alexa voice control capabilities. Think of it as a shrunken Echo with everything from smart-home controls to the ability to play audio games. Want a bit more out of your Echo Dot? You can opt for the Echo Dot with clock, which can double as a smart alarm clock for your nightstand. If you’re shopping for someone who wants a home that’s a bit smarter, the Echo Dot is a great option.Subscription cardsIf you’re not looking to spend a fortune, or just aren’t sure of what else to get your best bet might be the easiest one: gift cards. I’m not talking about a card for 10% off at Outback, though I’m not going to sneeze at that either, I’m talking about subscription cards for things like Netflix, Hulu, and Xbox Game Pass. You can also pick up cards for Apple’s App Store, Google’s Play Store, and more. It’s a helpful gift, and lets your loved one buy what they truly want.Happy shopping!Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanNvidia earnings: Revenue beats expectations, bottom line falls shortMusk's short reign at Twitter has been chaotic.

The Oct. 28 launch of ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II"" was the highest-grossing entertainment opening of 2022 — and last week the Activision Blizzard-owned (ATVI) franchise dropped its free-to-play ""Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0,"" which has garnered 25 million players since its Nov. 16 launch.""To blow past some of the biggest entertainment launches in the entire industry ... It's been a hallmark, watershed moment for us,"" Johanna Faries, senior vice president and general manager of ""Call of Duty,"" told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).In the 10 days following its launch, ""Modern Warfare II"" crossed $1 billion sales, breaking a franchise-best record set back in 2012 — despite rampant inflation slowing consumer spending. Retailers from Amazon (AMZN) to Walmart (WMT) are even preparing for a muted holiday season, as the slowdown's already shown up in earnings. But ""Call of Duty"" has bucked the consumer slowdown so far, a result of years of re-thinking the game specifically in response to what players want, said Faries.""We've been looking at this from every angle about how we make sure this new era for the franchise is built from a player-first lens,"" she said. ""To see it pay off now to the tune of the numbers we've been reporting in the last several days reflects a lot of that work.""The success of ""Modern Warfare II"" comes on the heels of years of pandemic growth in gaming, particularly for ""Call of Duty.""""It always starts with great experiences, and the product was ready for an exciting launch, regardless of what had happened on the pandemic side,"" Faries told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I think it's also a reflection of some of the investments we had been making to expand the bold opportunity we knew we had for 'Call of Duty.'""An image from 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,' courtesy of Activision Blizzard.Activision Blizzard is currently set to be acquired by Microsoft (MSFT), but Faries isn't focusing on that.Story continues""We understand that that has interesting possibilities for sure, but right now, our eyes are completely focused on this moment for 'Call of Duty,'"" she said.Building on pandemic wins""Call of Duty"" was set up especially well for a pandemic boom, partially as a matter of timing.""For example, when we launched our first ""Warzone"" experience back in 2020, it occurred in the same month as the pandemic started to really take shape across the world,"" said Faries. ""We learned a ton about how gaming could provide connection, interaction, and gathering spaces virtually when so much of the world was shut down.""That new knowledge has given way to new in-game features. For one, in ""Modern Warfare II,"" features like proximity chat – which allows players to hear and speak to other players nearby – have already made waves among users.""We're already seeing some incredible instances and interactions between players through that type of a feature,"" Faries told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I think it reflects just more of the social connection points that gaming affords our community. We often say 'Call of Duty' is one of the best ways to make friends, meet new friends, and create long-lasting connections.""In the end, for ""Call of Duty,"" growth and wins are fundamentally coming from the franchise's investment in and relationship with the game's community, said Faries.""More so than ever before, I think one of the reasons we're seeing success is that we've kept so close to our community of influencers and streamers, really thinking about what our players are looking for and how we deliver the best possible gameplay for them,"" she said.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The energy, well, it's popping, and we're looking at a lot of shops. People are not exactly in them, buying things. But Black Friday, of course, is right around the corner, and that means everybody, mostly everybody, will be looking for awesome tech gifts. And here's our very own tech editor, Dan Howley, looking for the hottest tech items.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, yeah. So every holiday season comes around, everybody wants to get their hands on some kind of tech for the people in their lives or just for themselves. That's kind of what I like to do. So I do have a good list of some of the biggest items.I think despite coming out two years ago, one of the biggest ones is still Sony's PlayStation 5. It's been a bear for people to get them. You had the COVID shutdowns, you had the chip shortages, you had a huge amount of demand, not enough product. It's still out there as one of the gifts that people really want. I was trying to get one the other day for my buddy. Not paying for it-- he's going to pay me back. But it's still sold out.After that, we have the rival, Xbox. It might not be as popular as the PlayStation, but Microsoft has some amazing services. They have Game Pass, which lets you get up to 300 games that you can just play on your Xbox without having to buy them, part of a subscription. And you have cloud gaming. So if you're on the go and on your phone, you can play those PC games or Xbox games on your device.There's a number that are outside of the gaming space, though. One of the more obscure ones that I want to hit real quick is the Valve Steam Deck. This is-- think of a Nintendo Switch.BRIAN SOZZI: I don't even know what that is.Story continuesDAN HOWLEY: Yeah--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm not supposed to say that, but I've never heard of it, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: I love it. The Steam Deck? Oh, it's awesome.BRIAN SOZZI: Don't know what it is.DAN HOWLEY: It's basically a Nintendo Switch that lets you play PC games. It's $399, a little on the pricier side. It's a little chunky, too, but it's really, really cool if you're a big PC gamer. Outside of gaming, though, there's the murderer's row, right? We have the iPhone 14 Pro. I might have one in my hand right now.BRIAN SOZZI: Very important, too. We're supposed to get Best Buy earnings this week, too, as well. That is supposed to be a key driver. I would really be listening to that Best Buy earnings call to see the adoption on that new iPhone. That is a great holiday season tale.DAN HOWLEY: And it's the bigger one, the Pro, so that's the one that's going to drive ASP for Apple and also the one that's kind of hard to get now because of those COVID shutdowns. So if you are shopping for one for somebody for the holidays, make sure that you go sooner, rather than later, because you might not be able to get it later on in the holiday season. Apple also has the Apple Watch. There's the SE and the Series 8. Don't go for the Ultra. It's $800. And unless you're climbing Everest--BRIAN SOZZI: That's nothing for a man of your stature.DAN HOWLEY: I mean, no, that's-- look, a million or bust. That's what I like to spend. Give me a couple of rollies. So I would say for most people, go with the SE. That one's going to run you a little bit less than the Series 8. We're talking about around $249. The Series 8 is $399. I have the Series 8 on because I'm bougie. And that's what I like to go for.There's also the AirPods Pro. They got the new AirPods, the second generation AirPods Pro. Great noise cancelation, great transparency mode. It kind of increases the ambient noise around you. So if you go for a run at night, and you're kind of creeped out, you can hear what's going on around you more. And then outside of Apple, we have Google, actually.BRIAN SOZZI: Do we care about Google this year?DAN HOWLEY: I do. We do. I'm throwing out the Pixel 7-- great smartphone, relatively inexpensive. Google throws all that Google AI magic in there. Improves the camera capabilities. You have photo editing. You have true tone. So it's a great, great smartphone. It's also just straight-up Android so there's not a whole bunch of other stuff thrown on top of it.And then believe it or not, they also have a great smartwatch, too, called the Pixel Watch. That thing is beautiful. It's the first Android smartwatch that I looked at.BRIAN SOZZI: Did they get the battery right yet? I have a Google OS operating watch for golf. I have a golf watch. The battery dies. It doesn't even make-- it doesn't even make it around, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: It's going to go-- I'll give you about a day, maybe a day and a half--BRIAN SOZZI: It's horrible.DAN HOWLEY: --if you turn the always on display off. The Apple Watch will last you a little bit longer with the always on display on.And then outside of those gifts, there's an Echo Dot, right? There's a new Echo Dot, Amazon, Alexa. It's got the clock built in. It's not bad.BRIAN SOZZI: Outside of all these items and just because you're on staff, you're still getting this question, your biggest protection from the tech space this holiday season.DAN HOWLEY: This holiday season, it's hard. I think where we were talking about the iPhone, we were talking about how it's going to be difficult for people to get their hands on it. Apple really needs the iPhone to do well this holiday season. The holiday season is when so many people go out and buy their devices. I think it might be a little bit of a disappointment, just because we're talking about these lockdowns.They lasted longer in that factory that really produces the Pro and the Pro Max. That's where they get the bulk of their iPhone money. That's also the one that people want the most. It has that new dynamic island. It has the better camera. It has the better display. So I think it might be a little disappointing there.I also want to throw out, gaming might do a little bit better than we're expecting. But it could still-- it's not going to push the year over year to new limits or anything.BRIAN SOZZI: We've seen a pullback in mobile gaming.DAN HOWLEY: We have. That's all advertising. And that's part of the reason why gaming suffered so far this year. They're not getting the mobile ads. And you look at an Activision Blizzard. Their mobile side all about ads. I mean, anybody that's anybody that's in the gaming space and in the advertising space is dealing with that kind of pullback. But if you can still get a PlayStation 5, I'm rooting for you.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I'll let you do your thing. Across the way is that big, bright Apple Store, seeing some shoppers in there. Dan Howley, tech editor for Yahoo Finance, always good to see you, my man. Appreciate it.DAN HOWLEY: You, too.]"

63,69da5d4b-1627-371c-a0c5-bd8e923634ca,SBUX,2022-11-22,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 72% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-corporation-nasdaq-sbux-favoured-110223894.html,1669114943,STORY,['SBUX'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Starbucks, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Starbucks ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Starbucks?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Starbucks already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Starbucks' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Starbucks. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.4% and 3.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of StarbucksThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can report that insiders do own shares in Starbucks Corporation. Insiders own US$2.3b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Starbucks. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

64,10a626c6-3c71-3741-b7db-4f2259c5228c,SBUX,2022-11-22,'Boomerang CEOs' don't always work out; Disney hopes this one bucks trend,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boomerang-ceos-dont-always-disney-053000831.html,1669095000,STORY,"['DIS', 'SBUX']","[By David RandallNEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Can Walt Disney Co bank on another hit sequel?That appears to be the hope behind the company's surprise decision to bring back former chief executive Bob Iger to replace Bob Chapek. The decision was largely cheered by Wall Street, with Disney's stock gaining more than 6% on Monday to cut its loss to 37% for the year to date.The move is effective immediately.During his first tenure from 2005 to 2020, Disney's annualised shareholder returns were more than 14%, well above its rival Comcast Corp and the broader stock market, and in total in that period the stock rose more than 400%.Yet analysts and some investors say that a returning CEO repeating their past success is not a given, and the decision to once again hand them the reins may be a sign that a company's culture is sputtering.""From a governance perspective it's a big red flag,"" said Brian Frank, whose Frank Funds has owned Disney on and off in the past and currently does not have a position in the company, viewing its valuation as too high. ""This is one of the highest- quality companies in the world with the best brands in the world but it shows to me that they're bad at succession planning.""Disney did not return a request for comment for this story.GAME-CHANGER OR DUD?Overall, the stock performance of companies led by CEOs who returned for another stint in their former position - so-called boomerang CEOs - was 10.1% lower during their tenures than companies led by chief executives who had not had the job before, according to a 2020 study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review by Christopher Bingham, Bradley Hendricks, Travis Howell, and Kalin Kolev.Chief among the factors for the poor performance of repeat CEOs were if the executive was a company founder, if they worked in a dynamic or fast-changing industry, and if the company had neglected succession planning, the study found.Story continuesShares of Xerox fell 60% in the year after Paul Allaire returned as CEO in 2000 as the company was unable to adapt to new digital technologies, the study found. Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble Co, meanwhile, rose about 3% during A.G. Lafley's two-year second stint as CEO, while the broad S&amp;P 500 index rose about 26% over the same time.Xerox declined comment and P&amp;G did not respond to a request for comment.Yet there are reasons to think that Disney may have made the right decision in bringing back Iger, Bingham said.""There might be more reason for optimism relative to some of these other boomerang CEOs as Iger was not the founder, was not gone for too long, and is coming back in with a plan to help succession,"" he said in an email to Reuters.Apple Inc's Steve Jobs is perhaps the best-case scenario of a chief executive returning to their previous company. Jobs famously resumed his position as CEO in 1997 when Apple was near collapse and remade it into the world's most valued company by the time he stepped down again in 2011.Howard Schultz, who built the Starbucks Corp franchise, was also successful in his second stint. Shares rose more than 1,000% in his tenure between 2008 and 2017.Starbucks did not comment on this story, but directed Reuters to its earnings results that topped expectations after Schultz’s third term as CEO.“I think this is a game-changer,"" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, about Disney. Link has owned the stock in the past and is bullish on the name. ""This reminds me very much of Starbucks 2.0 or 3.0 with Howard Schultz returning to Starbucks,” Link said. “I think the only thing is not great at is finding a successor.”While Wall Street is cheering Iger's return, Disney's long-term success will rest on whether he can successfully turn the company's streaming business profitable while managing the decline of its traditional television business and a likely slowdown in its parks division if the economy falls into a recession, said David Heger, an analyst at Edward Jones.""Iger may have dodged a bullet because the time period when Chapek was CEO was not ideal with the pandemic shutdown of the parks and the shutdown of movie production,"" Heger said. ""But it's not an enviable position to come back in to because there are so many different challenges across the business and industry.""(Reporting by David Randall in New York Editing by Megan Davies and Matthew Lewis)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy. The sharp decline in the stock market has investors and economists worried about the risks of a possible recession. According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance. We analyzed these stocks through their balance sheets, financial health, and dividend policies.

Revenue grew 21% and EPS grew 32% in the most recent reported quarter, and strong payment activity has persisted despite high inflation. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and was likely driven by adverse foreign exchange movements and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending. We retain conviction due to Mastercard’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”13. Apple Inc.

As we have highlighted in the past, Apple’s relentless focus on the development and integration between hardware (especially ICs) as well as software, continues to add significant value for customers of its products and services.

Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). ADM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 14.65, which compares to its industry's average of 15.43. Over the past 52 weeks, ADM's Forward P/E has been as high as 116.19 and as low as 11.67, with a median of 14.36.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. ADM has a P/S ratio of 0.53. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.9.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Archer Daniels Midland's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that ADM is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the present Thanksgiving week should be bullish for the stock market.The broader S&amp;P 500, in reality, has advanced 0.54% on average during the Thanksgiving week for the last 50 years compared with an average gain of just 0.16% in other weeks, per a yahoo finance article.The article further stated that during the Thanksgiving week, the stock market struggled to gain direction on Mondays and Tuesdays. However, the stock market did gain considerably the day before Thanksgiving (Thursday) and the day after. After all, consumers splurge during the holiday season, which subsequently bodes well for the economy vis-à-vis the stock market.Talking about seasonal trends, the stock market tends to do well in the November to January period. Since 1936, the S&amp;P 500 has increased 4.5% in the said period, way more than the average three months gain of 2.9%, according to Bank of America’s quantitative analysts, citing a MarketWatch article.Similarly, stocks tend to jack up after midterm elections. In 17 out of 19 midterms, since 1946, in the six months following an election, the stock market has given better returns compared to the six-month period leading up to it, as mentioned in a Schwab article. Americans already voted on Nov 8. Since then, till now, the S&amp;P 500 has gained around 5%.But it’s not just seasonal trends, the stock market is expected to perform well on signs of inflation cooling down last month. Stubbornly high inflation for most the part of the year led the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, eventually squeezing consumer outlays, increasing borrowing costs, and impacting economic growth. However, the consumer price index rose 7.7% year over year in October, less than September’s annual rise of 8.2%, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Additionally, the producer price index rose 8% last month compared to September’s year-over-year increase of 8.4%, indicating that inflation is waning, and that may compel the Fed to take a less aggressive monetary policy stance. Story continuesBanking on such positive trends, investors should place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) today announced the launch of its latest heat-not-burn tobacco heating system, BONDS by IQOS with its accompanying specially designed tobacco sticks, BLENDS. A new product from IQOS, the world’s No. 1 tobacco heating system2, BONDS by IQOS offers adults who would otherwise continue to smoke access to a compact, low maintenance and hassle-free to use smoke-free offer—validated by science—as a better alternative to cigarettes—to accelerate the achievement of a smoke-free future.BONDS by IQOS heats tobacco instead of burning it and delivers authentic tobacco taste satisfaction without ash and less smell than cigarettes3, thanks to resistive external heating, with no blade, via the ROUNDHEAT TOBACCO SYSTEMTM. When BONDS by IQOS heats the tobacco, it emits 95%4 less harmful chemicals compared to cigarettes5.Like all PMI’s smoke-free, nicotine containing products, BONDS by IQOS is intended for adults who would otherwise continue smoking or using other nicotine products, and who are looking for a better alternative to cigarettes.""BONDS by IQOS represents another step forward in our ambition to replace cigarettes with innovative, science-based, smoke-free alternatives,"" says Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer at PMI. He continues to say, ""We know that no single smoke-free product will appeal to all adult smokers. Providing a range of alternatives to continued smoking—with a variety of taste, technology, usage, and price options—is imperative and helps us to address a range of preferences as diverse as adult smokers themselves—ultimately encouraging them to leave cigarettes behind. BONDS by IQOS provides an opportunity to address consumer acquisition barriers for this segment, most notably up-front device costs and authentic tobacco taste satisfaction—providing further options of innovative smoke-free options to help ensure they do not go back to cigarettes. Through continuous innovation, we want to ensure that all adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking, switch and abandon cigarettes.""Story continuesPMI believes that they will only achieve a smoke-free future if all adult smokers who do not quit tobacco and nicotine altogether are aware, have access to, and can afford to switch to better alternatives. As of the end of 2021, PMI’s smoke-free products were available in 30 LMIC markets6—with the ambition clearly stated for at least 50% of the markets where it commercializes smoke-free products to be LMIC markets by 2025—bolstered by new innovative products for consumers with lower purchasing power.PMI’s goal is that by 2025 at least 40 million adults who would otherwise continue to smoke will have switched to its smoke-free products and that by 2025 more than 50% of its total net revenues will come from smoke-free products. As of September 30, 2022, PMI estimates there were approximately 19.5 million total IQOS users, excluding Russia and Ukraine, of which approximately 13.5 million have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion7.BONDS by IQOS is designed to be used only with BLENDS tobacco sticks to deliver a variety of tobacco tastes. At the time of launch, BLENDS tobacco sticks will be available in five different flavors, including classic, menthol and aromatic. When fully charged BONDS by IQOS delivers up to 20 uses, including three consecutive experiences. BONDS by IQOS comes in four different colors.BONDS by IQOS is available in a pilot city launch in the Philippines as of November 22, with further commercialization anticipated during the remainder of 2022 and next year.Further information in relation to PMI’s smoke-free products can be found on https://www.iqos.com.Important information: BONDS by IQOS is not risk-free.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that an exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health.

77,9d7427aa-eee6-3e3f-ae81-67574645981e,PM,2022-11-22,Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-pm-140002559.html,1669039202,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned +11.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Tobacco industry, which Philip Morris falls in, has gained 6.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of -2.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 points to a change of -4.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.60 indicates a change of -3.4% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Philip Morris.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.33 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.23 billion and $29.68 billion estimates indicate -3.8% and -1.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.1%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.16%. The EPS surprise was +10.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This exchange-traded fund (ETF) has 34 real estate investment trust holdings and is generally considered a benchmark for movements in the sector.Here’s the weekly price chart:Not only is it steadily upward off of the mid-October low price, it’s crossed back above a slightly uptrending 200-week moving average. Also, there seems to be a positive price divergence emerging on the relative strength indicator (RSI) below the price chart. The next step for bulls would be for the fund to make it above the 50-week moving average and stay there long enough to turn that indicator upward again.Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG) is one of the larger components of the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund, with a market capitalization of $38.6 billion. The weekly price chart is here:The price managed to cross back above both the 200- and the 50-week moving averages. Both continue to trend downward, but this is progress, as long as it continues. Note the positive divergence on the relative strength chart — a higher RSI reading even though the September low came in lower than the June and July lows.Simon Property pays a dividend of 6.22%.Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) has a market capitalization of $40.6 billion, making it another of the major REITs to watch. The weekly price chart looks like this:After that massive slide in price from early August all the way into mid-October, buying interest is showing up again in this REIT. It’s back above the 50-week moving average and recently just touched the 200-week moving average. Realty is paying a 4.62% dividend at this price.Story continuesExtra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE: EXR) is another major REIT with a market capitalization of $21.2 billion. Here is the weekly price chart:This REIT never fell as dramatically as the others, but it’s not rallying back as strongly either. The price remains steadily above a rising 200-week moving average, a bullish indicator. It would be better for investors to see it rise and stay above the 50-week moving average so that a trend reversal might be clear.Extra Space Storage pays a 3.86% dividend.REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, HCA Healthcare's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on HCA Healthcare will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is HCA Healthcare's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the market for P/E ratios like HCA Healthcare's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 9.0%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 86% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 8.5% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 8.9% each year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it odd that HCA Healthcare is trading at a P/E lower than the market. It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.The Bottom Line On HCA Healthcare's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that HCA Healthcare currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the outlook. It appears some are indeed anticipating earnings instability, because these conditions should normally provide more support to the share price.Having said that, be aware HCA Healthcare is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning.If you're unsure about the strength of HCA Healthcare's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.6%. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. However, Goldman Sachs Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.EPS is set to fall by 0.07% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 28%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.40 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $10.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 22% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Goldman Sachs Group has grown earnings per share at 14% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Goldman Sachs Group's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.We Really Like Goldman Sachs Group's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Goldman Sachs Group is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Now, there's really a lot to break down in this note. One of the other notes, of course, within this out from Goldman is talking about the confidence that remains high and even a China second-quarter 2023 reopening and what that could mean more broadly globally as well too.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, this is a note out from Peter Oppenheimer. I'm a big fan of Peter Oppenheimer. He came out in late September and said the market is likely to come under pressure. That call was right. So I'm inclined to listen to what he's saying here. First line out of this note here, the bear market is not over. In our view, I think he's really concerned about higher interest rates hammering corporate profits next year.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and obviously, that's something that's already been a theme, right? He does say, if you look further out into 2023, then markets will transition in what he calls a hope phase. But it's just not that we're there yet. And I mean, this is not that different from what we've been hearing from a lot of other strategists, right, this refrain that until we get a little more clarity on the end of the tightening cycle--I saw another note this morning that talked about how it would be unusual for the market to bottom before the recession is even-- like this far in advance of when the recession actually begins. And this recession is very telegraphed. So this is not-- this is not totally out-- of the reservation kind of view, right, that we were getting from Oppenheimer.BRIAN SOZZI: And this comes alongside the commodities team at Goldman, saying potential for $100 a barrel oil. But I think they hedge their bets a little bit, and it fits what Oppenheimer said here. They're concerned about the impact of COVID lockdowns in China and what that means to the oil market.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Yeah, and what they had put within that note-- they were waiting for broader market-- or broader macro stability to generate an increase in passive flows, but the burden of proof still remains on fundamentals-- their words there. They had also talked about the underperformance of WTI. But again, when you hear about some of those elevated oil prices, of course, not just year over year but elevated at some of the more historical levels as well, that's something that consumers are also paying close attention to because they factor in-- all right, how much is this actually going to impact the energy prices that I'm paying, the bottom line that is going out the door for me in the household?BRIAN SOZZI: And gas is down to $4 a gallon, Julie. That's pretty good. I'm pretty excited about it.JULIE HYMAN: Well, I guess--BRIAN SOZZI: What was it? Like $6. Like, it was crazy.JULIE HYMAN: Well, I guess the message is don't get used to it.BRIAN SOZZI: Don't get used to it?JULIE HYMAN: Maybe. Because if we're--BRIAN SOZZI: [INAUDIBLE] good news to anything? No? All right.JULIE HYMAN: Sorry.[LAUGHTER]]"

The average selling price of US$46.02 is still lower than the current share price, or in other words, insiders would have been better off holding on to their shares.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SchlumbergerIn fact, the recent sale by Khaled Al Mogharbel was the biggest sale of Schlumberger shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$52.27. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Schlumberger better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Schlumberger Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Schlumberger. In total, insiders dumped US$6.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does Schlumberger Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Schlumberger insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$141m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Schlumberger Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Schlumberger shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Schlumberger is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Schlumberger. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Schlumberger you should be aware of.But note: Schlumberger may not be the best stock to buy.

SLB surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.The 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.Moving Average Chart for SLBSLB has rallied 6% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests SLB could be on the verge of another move higher.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider SLB's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 7 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.Investors may want to watch SLB for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to KPMG’s 2022 Media Consumer Survey, one in five consumers is canceling at least one streaming service as a result of inflation, and nearly four in 10 say they will cancel if inflation doesn’t cool down.SNAP Benefits: How Long Do They Last?  To Do: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowAs consumers are cornered into paring down their streaming services, it’s important to know which ones are the most cost effective — and what exactly they deliver — so people can decide which service is best for them.Here’s a look at seven budget-friendly streaming services.Pluto TVPrice: FreeAds: Yes“Pluto TV is one that you don’t hear as much about, but it’s probably the best free ad-supported service on the market,” said Chris Brantner, head streaming analyst at Sportscriber. “It’s set up like a cable TV guide so you can scroll channels. There are all sorts of channels playing on-demand shows and sports fight channels. There are also news channels and movies on demand.”Sling TVPrice: $40 a month (targeted at cord cutters)Ads: Yes“When discussing affordable streaming services, it’s useful to break them into categories,” Brantner said. “First, if you’re looking for a channel bundle that functions as a replacement for live cable TV, Sling TV is the most affordable. With Sling TV, you can get up to live channels for $40 a month, or you can choose their larger packages for $55 for 47 channels,” Brantner said. “This gives you access to live channels ranging from ESPN and NFL Network to CNN and TNT. It’s ideal for someone who wants to watch both sports and news programming live.”HuluPrice: $7.99 a monthAds: Yes“There are a couple of tiers of plans: Ad-supported is $7.99 per month, while ad-free is $14.99 per month,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst at DealNews.com. “An ad-supported student plan is also available for those that qualify for just $1.99 per month. The offerings on these plans include things like past and current TV shows, including the most recent episodes of some shows available to watch the day after airing. There are also new and classic movies and original series, as well. Examples include ‘Bob’s Burgers,’ ‘Prey’ and ‘The Handmaid’s Tale.'”Story continuesApple TV+Price: $6.99 a monthAds: No“Apple TV+ is one of the most affordable streaming services you can get,” said Sudhir Khatwani, the founder of The Money Mongers. “It is the home of Apple Originals, along with many award-winning series and movies.”Khatwani adds that you can also get three months of free Apple TV+ service when you purchase a new Apple device.Netflix (Basic)Price: $6.99 a monthAds: Yes“One of the most affordable streaming services has got to be Netflix, with its ‘Basic with ads’ plan,” said Andrew Gonzales, co-founder and president at BusinessLoans.com. “This is a good option if you plan to use Netflix on one supported device at a time, which is often the case for solo users and smaller households. Though you can watch in HD, certain shows and movies are unavailable on this plan due to licensing restrictions. However, at just $6.99 per month, this plan is almost three times cheaper than Netflix’s premium offering.”Peacock TVPrice: $4.99 a monthAds: Yes“The best advantage of Peacock TV is it offers [80,000+] hours of streaming,” said Daniel Apke, CEO and co-founder of Land Investing Online. “If you want a premium account, you pay $4.99 per month to access movies, including live sports and events, like WWE, Premier League and ‘Sunday Night Football.’ There’s a premium plus tier for $9.99 per month for ad-free streaming, which also gives you the option to download and watch selected shows offline.”ESPN+Price: $9.99 a monthAds: Yes, for live games“If you’re just looking for sports content, ESPN+ is one of the least expensive,” Brantner said. “For $9.99 a month, you get the best of what ESPN has to offer, including live ‘Monday Night Football,’ college football, UFC prelims and more. You can also save by paying $99 annually.”More From GOBankingRates9 Costco Brand Items That Aren't Worth the MoneyGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings Tips5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00010 Things to Do Now If Your Credit Score Is Under 700This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Budget-Friendly Streaming Services]"

(NYSE:TJX)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-tjx-140036325.html,1669039236,STORY,['TJX'],"[Let's talk about the popular The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on TJX Companies’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies What's The Opportunity In TJX Companies?According to my valuation model, TJX Companies seems to be fairly priced at around 4.80% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TJX Companies today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $74.58, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Furthermore, TJX Companies’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will TJX Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. TJX Companies' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 40%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TJX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TJX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

(AMGN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-amgn-attracting-investor-140002222.html,1669039202,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +14%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has gained 9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $3.93 per share, indicating a change of -9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.64 points to a change of +3.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.62 indicates a change of +5.5% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMGN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Amgen, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.22 billion and $27.14 billion estimates indicate +0.9% and +3.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.8%. EPS of $4.70 for the same period compares with $4.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.32%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Gold Mining Companies in the World. Gold is one of the most central assets in the financial world. Used as a currency standard until the late 19th century, the metal is still thought to be the second safest investment in the world after the U.S. dollar, with the only difference between the two being that dollar deposits yield an interest while gold only delivers a return in the form of price appreciation.2022 has seen broad market turmoil that has led to investors fleeing away from gold and back into the U.S. dollar as the Federal Reserve's brutal interest rate hike spree delivers large returns for bank deposits. Gold price is also perhaps the most crucially watched indicator these days, as it provides insight into investor opinion about the strength of the U.S. dollar.The gold mining market forms the backbone of modern day gold, and the sector will be worth $221 billion by the end of this year according to a research report from Market Growth Reports. From then until 2028, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% to be worth $260 billion by the end of the forecast period. Driving this growth will be more industrial use cases for the metal as well as new technologies that improve mining capabilities and efficiencies believes the research firm.Another report, this time from Research and Markets, estimates that the gold mining industry was worth $214 billion last year, and it will grow at a CAGR of 3.1% until 2026 to sit at $250 billion. Looking at the industry through use cases, Research and Markets believes that the jewelry end use will grow from $107 billion in 2021 to $125 billion in 2026 with a 3% CAGR. On the other hand, the use of gold as a central bank asset will grow faster than the market as a whole, through a 3.5% CAGR that will see it blossom from being worth $23 billion in 2021 to $27 billion in 2026.Story continuesToday's piece will take a look at some of the largest gold mining companies in the world, and out of these, the top players are Barrick Gold Corporation (BCBA:GOLD.BA), Newmont Corporation (BCBA:NEM.BA), and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (BCBA:AEM.BA).Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology We studied the gold mining industry in depth to sift out the different firms that mine for the precious metal.

You can skip our discussion on the retail industry and go directly to the 5 Best Retail Stocks to Buy Now.Due to macroeconomic uncertainty, some of the leading retail stocks have taken a beating this year. Inflation is still very high, as the Department of Labor revealed that the consumer price index (CPI) for October 2022 increased by 7.7% year-over-year (YoY). On a month-over-month (MoM) basis, the CPI rose by 0.4%. Inflation rose to 9% in June and is still hovering around a four-decade high. To combat raging inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates on five occasions since March 2022. The cumulative increase during this period has been three percentage points (ppts) as the benchmark interest rate is in a range of 3% to 3.25%. The benchmark interest rates are at their highest level since 2008. The retail sector is not only facing headwinds in the form of raging inflation and rising interest rates, but the supply chain disruptions and rising inventories have also cast doubts on the growth prospects of the retail sector.However, analysts remain bullish on the long-term outlook of the retail sector and expect the best retail stocks to bounce back during the holiday season. The National Retail Federation anticipates the annual retail sales to observe a 6-8% growth to reach $4.86 trillion in 2022. Meanwhile, the year-over-year online and non-store sales are projected to rise by 11-13% to meet the target of $1.17 trillion. Halloween spending is also expected to recover back to the pre-pandemic level of $10.6 billion this year, compared to $10.1 billion in 2021. Interestingly, Americans spent $2.9 billion on Halloween costumes in 2022, which was the highest spending for this category since 2017. Consumer sentiment has begun to improve, and retailers have prepared themselves accordingly to match the increase in demand. American consumers are expected to increase Christmas spending by 4% YoY to $916.4 billion in 2022, up from $881.2 billion in 2021.Story continuesMany companies, such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), are making use of aggressive pricing policies and discounts to capture greater market share. According to a survey conducted by 4Over comprising 1,000 respondents, six out of 10 consumers are concerned about buying holiday gifts this year due to inflation. Hence, market penetration policies are expected to encourage sales during the holiday season.Photo by Franki Chamaki on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have looked at the business fundamentals and expansion plans of these companies.

(NYSE:LEVI) is a San Francisco, California-based apparel company.In a research note issued on October 10, Paul Lejuez at Citi gave Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE:LEVI) stock a Buy rating with a target price of $19. Although the company missed the Q3 2022 revenue forecast of $1.58 billion by $80 million, it was able to surpass the adjusted EPS forecast of $0.37 by three cents. The revenue miss was primarily driven by the foreign exchange headwinds as the US dollar gained strength against leading global currencies.Lejuez has selected Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

The company is a youth-centric brand that focuses on sneakers and other casual footwear categories.Trends like the casualization of workwear are expected to play in favor of Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) and provide it with new growth avenues. The company is also working on transitioning into an off-mall large store format category. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) plans to position itself as a multi-brand footwear store. The appointment of ex-Ulta Beauty, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ULTA) CEO Mary Dillon as the company’s new CEO is also expected to take Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) in a new direction. During her eight years at Ulta Beauty, Dillon doubled revenues and reinvented the business to become a top Fortune 500 retailer. Under the new leadership, Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is expected to emerge as one of the best retail stocks to own.Miller Value Partners shared its bullish stance on Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA), and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”7.

106,694c7607-1291-35dd-a4bd-9d51c995c0ef,M,2022-11-22,10 Biggest Discount Store Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-biggest-discount-store-companies-165323842.html,1668963203,STORY,['M'],"[In this article, we discuss 10 biggest discount store companies in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Discount Store Companies in the World. The discount channel produced between $27.76 billion in sales worldwide in 2022. This figure is expected to reach $583 billion by 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% (CAGR).Bargain merchants are capitalizing on the changing buying behaviors of the typical American consumer by offering lower prices to attract customers. Even when the overall economy was doing well and the unemployment rate was dropping to its lowest levels, consumers in the United States had started to change their spending patterns. But the rising inflation in 2022 forced even the well off demographic to flock to discount stores. Several studies show that rising inflation is now eating into the savings of millions of Americans. Retirement funds are drying up and young Americans are also facing the heat as major companies in the country begin to lay off their staff to cut costs. With the Federal Reserve showing no signs of stopping its interest rate hikes, people are increasing their trips to discount stores for clothing, grocery and household items. Because of this industry trend, discount store companies are expected to gain traction not only in the US but also in emerging markets.Discount stores cater to a specific group of people, typically those with lower to middling incomes. This industry is in high demand due to consumer spending patterns and potential population growth in areas near bargain retailers. The total profitability of independent discount store enterprises is reliant on their ability to remain competitive in terms of pricing and improving revenue per square foot. Smaller companies tend to focus more on building niche markets for specific items or identifying new needs that haven't yet been discovered. When it comes to leasing retail space and negotiating lower supplier rates, larger enterprises enjoy an advantage in the market.Story continuesIn response to these subtle shifts in the shopping practices of their customers, discount merchants like Dollar General and Aldi have been swiftly extending their operations across the United States and investing in the digital infrastructure of their businesses. Amazon has made several changes to the structure of its Prime subscription such as simplifying the pricing structure.Discount department stores are expanding faster than other retail locations. It is anticipated that the yearly growth rate for value-based or cheap businesses that do not sell food, like Dollar General, will be 5.2% until 2024. It is also expected that there will be a growth of 4.9% in discount grocery retailers such as Lidl.10 Biggest Discount Store Companies in the Worldomar-abascal-9Um7Huux0as-unsplashOur MethodologyWe picked some of the most notable discount retailers based on their market cap.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD awarded the deal. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States. The work is scheduled to be completed by November 2025.Moreover, the contract will serve the U.S. Army and foreign military sales.Significance of AIM-9XRaytheon’s AIM-9X Sidewinder is a triple-threat missile that can be used for air-to-air engagements, and surface-attack and surface-launch missions without modifications. The advanced infrared-tracking, short-range missile is combat-proven in several theaters worldwide.Moreover, it is configured for easy installation on a range of modern aircraft. These include the F-15C Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Super Hornet, E/A-18G Growler, F-22 Raptor and all F-35 Joint Strike Fighter variants.The AIM-9X Block II missile adds a redesigned fuse and a digital ignition safety device to improve handling and in-flight safety. It's equipped with updated electronics, including a lock-on-after-launch capability using a new weapon datalink to support beyond-visual-range engagements.Due to its advanced features, RTX has been witnessing strong demand involving the missile. The latest contract win is an example of that. The strength in demand for the missile can be gauged by its customer base of 28 Foreign Military Sales partners apart from the U.S. Army.Moreover, with the rising geopolitical tension and political risks, the demand may continue to increase by leaps and bounds.

I'm playing a number of stocks from China's biggest retailer, JD.com, to Las Vegas Sands, and Wynn as well, both of whom have exposure, of course, in Macau. China enduring its largest COVID outbreak since April. Beijing reporting its first COVID deaths in nearly six months. This comes just as optimism was rising that Chinese officials would begin to relax the COVID lockdowns that have crippled their economy, snarled supply chains around the globe.China reported more than 26,000 new cases on Sunday, the region of Guangzhou seeing more than 80,000 cases since October 22. And you're seeing that play out in these stocks. JD.com down, let's see, about 6%. Las Vegas Sands down 3 and 1/2%. MGM down 3%. A ETF, K Webb, full of Chinese internet stocks, down about 3 and 1/2%.Pretty much all of them seeing that same-- and you know, Rachelle, we've talked about this repeatedly. Fool me once, fool me twice. This reopening is not going to happen anytime soon. Xi will stick with COVID zero, unconcerned about the economic impact.- I mean, I'd guess that we've spoken to have said he's going to put the health of people in China first, even if it's hurting the economy, as we've seen. And even moves by the bank in China trying to really still prop up the economy when there was issues with the property sector. But as long as you have that COVID zero policy in place, it's very hard to sort of pin anything on it.Every time there's a reopening, people get excited. We see the stock prices go up. And then soon enough, as cases start to climb up and the lockdowns continue, right back to where we started. So people should really take a very slow and steady approach to this. Clearly, not out of the woods any time soon.- And we talked about that when we saw that initial reaction on the reports, just the fact that this could be reversed or they could clearly not follow through with the plans that have been laid out. And that certainly seems to be the case, at least for now.So I think we're going to see kind of this volatility in so many of these names that have large exposure to Macau or these Chinese US-listed stocks here just as people try to figure out what that policy is going to look like not necessarily now, but 6 months from now and 12 months from now. And I think as we've been reporting, it's just too hard to try to pinpoint that, at least at this point.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Masco (NYSE:MAS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Masco How Quickly Is Masco Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Masco's EPS has grown 23% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Masco shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 13% to 16% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Masco.Story continuesAre Masco Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$11b company like Masco. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$51m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Does Masco Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Masco's strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Masco (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

""Pets Best is an ideal partner for Dutch, as they help us further our mission to provide seamless, transparent, quality veterinary care to pet parents across the country,"" he added.Launched in July 2021 by Joe Spector - co-founder of HIMS - Dutch has had a pet-first mentality since its inception, but it is equally committed to pet parents by providing the highest quality care that’s also affordable, accessible, and extremely user-friendly. Unlike competitive virtual veterinary services, Dutch connects its customers directly with licensed veterinarians only so its veterinary experts can get to the root of the problem and provide a personalized care plan and treatment as quickly, efficiently, and effectively as possible, which is typically within 24 hours. Dutch is notably the one and only veterinary telemedicine company that can also prescribe and ship both OTC and Rx medications - which span beyond common flea and tick treatments - to patients through its virtual model. With its added pet insurance policy, Dutch is establishing itself the one-stop-shop for vet care needs across the US.Story continues""Pets Best understands that accidents happen - from a pet accidentally swallowing a new chew toy, to breaking bones and needing emergency surgery,"" said Melissa Gutierrez, senior vice president and general manager, Pets Best. ""The combination of Pets Best’s Accident Only insurance coverage and Dutch’s 24/7 virtual veterinary care means pet parents will have easy and convenient access to pet care and resources when they need them most.""Dutch and Pets Best are meeting the rising demand for veterinary services through API driven solutions, and innovative pet insurance products, further advancing the pet health industry. The accident policies do not cover pre-existing injuries, cruciate ligament injuries, or any illnesses or diseases, including infectious bacterial or viral disease, parasitic infection, metabolic disorder, or cancer. The Dutch x Pets Best insurance plan is available only through the Dutch website. For more information, please visit https://www.dutch.com/.About DutchLaunched in July 2021, Dutch is the first and only veterinary telehealth company connecting licensed, independent veterinarians directly with pets and their parents nationwide. At its inception, Dutch primarily addressed common chronic ailments, such as anxiety and allergies, but has grown to treat over 150 conditions and serve over 40,000 customers. In 2022, Dutch introduced Rx services, which allow the company’s licensed veterinarians to prescribe and ship OTC and prescription medications to patients in 40 states. Dutch memberships, excluding insurance, begin at just $15/month, and include unlimited access to virtual veterinary care through video and chat models. In a country experiencing a critical vet shortage of just one veterinarian for every 6,000 pet households, Dutch is creating a more accessible means of dependable, quality vet care that can address the modern pet parents’ needs in a timely manner and at a fraction of the cost.About SynchronySynchrony (NYSE: SYF) is a premier consumer financial services company.

This growth is attributed to the improved infrastructure for making payments and for storing and accessing financial data. This includes factors such as better internet connectivity, improved mobile networks, and advancements in disruptive technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence.Another key driver is the growing investment from both venture capitalists and traditional financial institutions. This investment is helping to fuel the development of new products and services and is also helping to increase awareness of fintech among the general public. According to KPMG, global investments in fintech totaled $210 billion in 2021, up from $125 billion in 2020.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy. The sharp decline in the stock market has investors and economists worried about the risks of a possible recession. According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Dividend Yield as of November 21: 1.56%Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is an Irish-American information technology company that specializes in related services and consulting. In October, JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a $306 price target, appreciating the company's fundamental and business model in the current environment.In fiscal Q4 2022, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) posted revenue of $15.4 billion, which saw a 14.9% growth from the same period last year. The company's free cash flow for the quarter came in at $3.6 billion and its operating cash flow came in at $3.8 billion. Its cash flow was sufficient as the company's dividend payments for the quarter amounted to $614 million.On September 22, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) announced a 15.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.12 per share. This marked the company's 17th consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock has a dividend yield of 1.56%, as recorded on November 21.At the end of Q3 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), down from 61 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $3.47 billion.Distillate Capital Partners LLC mentioned Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The largest new purchases includes Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership. Similar to our prior presentations, one way to visualize the current portfolio and note recent changes versus the benchmark is to look at scatter plot of all of Distillate’s FSV holdings versus those in the benchmark with valuation on the vertical axis and free cash ϲow stability on the horizontal axis.”6. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Dividend Yield as of November 21: 1.74%Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in motion and control technologies. Citigroup resumed its coverage on the stock in October with a Neutral rating, presenting a positive stance on the overall industry due to growing demand for tech products.In fiscal Q1 2023, Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) reported revenue of $4.23 billion, up 12.5% from the same period last year. Year-to-date, the company's operating cash flow came in at $457.4 million, compared with $424.4 million in the prior-year period.Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) holds one of the longest dividend growth track records in the S&amp;P 500. The company has raised its payouts consistently for the past 66 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks alongside Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.33 per share for a dividend yield of 1.74%.As of the close of Q3 2022, 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), growing from 35 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $848.3 million.Oakmark Funds mentioned Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

As travel restrictions continue to disappear, MA’s cross-border volumes are paving way for lucrative growth. The metric has significant weightage in the company’s revenue generation. Also, geographical expansion and Digital First solutions will keep triggering growth.In the first nine months of 2022, cross-border volumes (a key measure that tracks spending on cards beyond the issuing country) soared 51% year over year on a local-currency basis. During this period, the metric comprised 29.3% of Mastercard’s net revenues compared with 24% a year ago. Things are not expected to cool down yet.In 2019, cross-border volume fees comprised 33.2% of Mastercard’s net revenues before the COVID-19 pandemic struck down traveling. In 2020, cross-border volume fees plunged 37%. Given the current environment, where international travel continues to recover, Mastercard’s cross-border volume fees are bound to go up.Moreover, international air travel is far from completing its full recovery. Analysts expect it to return to pre-pandemic levels by the December quarter of 2022 or early 2023. This will continue supporting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s cross-border volumes in the coming days. Investors holding the stock are expected to benefit strongly from this growth.Other Key DriversIts solid market position and an attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements and an expansion of service offerings, should sustain long-term growth. Ongoing initiatives, including digital strategy and continued widening geographic footprints, create further optimism.Even though MA suspended business operations in Russia in March 2022, its focus on developing regions in Indo-Pacific and South America will likely offset the negatives and keep increasing transaction volumes. In the first nine months of 2022, transaction processing revenues jumped 19% year over year.Story continuesEstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MA’s 2022 and 2023 revenues indicate a 17.3% and 12.7% year-over-year rise, respectively. The consensus mark for the 2022 and 2023 bottom line signals 26.1% and 14.1% year-over-year growth, respectively. It beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average of 11.8%.For the fourth quarter of 2022, management anticipates both net revenues and operating expenses to register low-end to low-double-digit growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.RiskMastercard’s valuation remains stretched at the current level. It currently has a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 28.85X, much higher than the industry average of 20.70X. Despite its overvalued state, investors might agree to pay the premium, considering its long-term potential.Price MovementsShares of Mastercard have increased 7% in the past year against the industry’s 13.4% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services space are PaySign, Inc.

122,d64a2d86-4b3f-3aea-9186-f678a50cf449,QCOM,2022-11-22,Is Weakness In QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-qualcomm-incorporated-nasdaq-qcom-110139045.html,1669114899,STORY,['QCOM'],"[With its stock down 15% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study QUALCOMM's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:72% = US$13b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.72 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 72% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that QUALCOMM has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, QUALCOMM's considerable five year net income growth of 54% was to be expected.We then compared QUALCOMM's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 27% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is QCOM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether QCOM is currently mispriced by the market.Is QUALCOMM Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?QUALCOMM's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 37%, meaning the company retains 63% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and QUALCOMM is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Moreover, QUALCOMM is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 29% over the next three years. However, QUALCOMM's future ROE is expected to decline to 37% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with QUALCOMM's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has gained 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -36.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.21 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.5%. This estimate has changed -21.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.31 indicates a change of +20.6% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.62 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $40.13 billion and $45.96 billion estimates indicate -9.2% and +14.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $11.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $3.13 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Each tranche has ranged from few hundred million to nearly a billion, he said, and the rate of receiving funds has a high correlation to new contract awards for replacement weapons.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the defense sector of Europe, you can go directly to 5 Biggest European Defense Companies.The European Defense Industry: An AnalysisThe defense sector of Europe is a large and complex industry that provides a variety of products and services to militaries and other government organizations. The sector is made up of a number of different companies and organizations, each with its own specialties. The defense sector of Europe is a major contributor to the economy, employing thousands of people and generating billions of euros in revenue each year. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, defense spending in Europe amounted to $417.8 billion in 2021, making it rank among the continents with the highest defense spending in the world. Moreover, country-wise, Russia, France, Germany, the UK, and Italy have dominated the share of global defense spending each year throughout history and have invested most heavily in the research and development of weaponry and military assets. Mordor Intelligence expects the European defense market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3% from 2022 through 2027.Furthermore, Mordor Intelligence expects Russia to dominate the market share of the European defense market throughout the forecasted period. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a further catalyst in this trend since Russia has been excessively utilizing cluster bombs, rockets, and artilleries to support itself in the war, and is consequently causing a surge in demand for weaponry.Russia is expected to hold the major market share of the European defense market, followed by the United Kingdom, and France. Other prominent countries that are expected to account for a major share include Germany, Ukraine, and Poland. This article will look at some of the biggest European defense companies which are competing and collaborating with their American counterparts The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Story continuesLargest Defense Contractors in the WorldPhoto by Cibi Chakravarthi on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the biggest European defense companies, we reviewed industry analysis reports and identified major defense companies operating in Europe. We included both public and private companies in our rankings. For public companies, we gave weight to their market cap, and for private companies, we looked at other metrics such as estimated annual revenue, cash flows, and estimated valuation among others that can help determine a company's size.Biggest European Defense Companies15.

It's equipped with updated electronics, including a lock-on-after-launch capability using a new weapon datalink to support beyond-visual-range engagements.Due to its advanced features, RTX has been witnessing strong demand involving the missile. The latest contract win is an example of that. The strength in demand for the missile can be gauged by its customer base of 28 Foreign Military Sales partners apart from the U.S. Army.Moreover, with the rising geopolitical tension and political risks, the demand may continue to increase by leaps and bounds. This may boost Raytheon’s revenue generation prospects from missile programs in the long term.Growth ProspectsThe rising geopolitical tension and the recent turbulence between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in many countries increasing their defense budget to improve and modernize warfare capabilities and strengthen their arms and ammunition inventory.Story continuesThe intensifying demand for technologically advanced weapons and arsenals has spurred the demand for an effective missile, thereby boosting the market’s growth.

The organic comparison excludes a $457 million negative impact from foreign currency translation and a $25 million contribution from the company's fiscal first quarter acquisition of Intersect ENT, which is reported in the Specialty Therapies division in the Neuroscience Portfolio. Unless otherwise stated, all revenue growth rates in this press release are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and revenue from the Intersect ENT acquisition.The company's second quarter organic revenue results reflect slower supply recovery or lower than anticipated underlying market procedure volumes in certain businesses and the pricing impact of volume-based procurement in China. These challenges were partially offset by strength in certain product lines, including Transcatheter Aortic Valves (TAVR), Cardiac Pacing, Core Spine in the United States, and Diabetes in International.As reported, second quarter GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $427 million and $0.32, respectively, both decreases of 67%. As detailed in the financial schedules included at the end of this release, second quarter non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.725 billion and $1.30, respectively, decreases of 4% and 2%, respectively. Included in the company's GAAP earnings is a $764 million income tax reserve adjustment that was a direct result of the previously disclosed U.S. Tax Court opinion issued in the fiscal second quarter. The company's earnings decline also reflects the continued macroeconomic impact of inflation on materials, direct labor, freight, and utilities.Story continuesSecond quarter U.S. revenue of $4.069 billion represented 54% of company revenue and increased 2% as reported and 1% organic. Non-U.S. developed market revenue of $2.157 billion represented 28% of company revenue and decreased 13% as reported and increased 3% organic. Emerging Markets revenue of $1.359 billion represented 18% of company revenue and decreased 1% as reported and increased 4% organic.""Slower than predicted procedure and supply recovery drove revenue below our expectations this quarter. We continue to take decisive actions to improve the overall performance of the company, including streamlining our organizational structure, strengthening our supply chain, driving a performance culture, and strategically allocating capital to support our best growth opportunities with the investments they deserve,"" said Geoff Martha, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer. ""We're seeing the benefit of these changes – along with new incentives and strong execution – in certain businesses, and we're focused on ensuring these efforts translate into improved performance across the company. Looking ahead, we're confident we have a clear path to delivering durable growth and increased shareholder value.""Cardiovascular PortfolioThe Cardiovascular Portfolio includes the Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure (CRHF), Structural Heart &amp; Aortic (SHA), and Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular (CPV) divisions.

Medical Surgical revenue of $2.070 billion decreased 10% as reported and 3% organic, with a low-double digit decline in RGR and partially offset by low-single digit growth in SI.

Advanced Surgical Instruments decreased low-single digits given expected acute supply chain shortages of raw materials and the impact of China provincial volume-based procurement (VBP) stapling tenders. These declines were partially offset by strength in Hernia &amp; Wound Management, which increased mid-single digits. In Surgical Robotics, the company received three significant regulatory approvals for its Hugo™ robotic-assisted surgery system: Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark clearance for a general surgery indication, Health Canada license for a general laparoscopic surgery indication, and Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) approval for urological and gynecological indications in Japan.Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal revenue of $671 million decreased 16% as reported and 11% organic. RGR revenue decreased 5% organic excluding the impact of ventilator sales. Respiratory Interventions decreased mid-twenties, with sales of ventilators declining low-fifties as demand continued to be well below pre-pandemic levels as expected. Patient Monitoring decreased mid-single digits, with expected low-double digit declines in Nellcor™ pulse oximetry products as COVID tailwinds abate, offset by low-double digit growth in Perioperative Complications products. The company announced last month its intention to separate the combined Respiratory Interventions and Patient Monitoring businesses. Gastrointestinal revenue decreased low-single digits given non-emergent procedure softness in the market, including low-double digit declines in Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) products partially offset by low-single digit growth in Chronic and Colorectal products. Renal Care Solutions decreased low-double digits given product availability challenges. Medtronic announced in May its intention to contribute its Renal Care Solutions business into a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company together with DaVita.Neuroscience PortfolioThe Neuroscience Portfolio includes the Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies (CST), Specialty Therapies, and Neuromodulation divisions. Neuroscience revenue of $2.186 billion increased 2% as reported and 5% organic, with a high-single digit increase in Specialty Therapies, a mid-single digit increase in CST, and a flat result year-over-year in Neuromodulation, all on an organic basis.Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies revenue of $1.081 billion increased 1% as reported and 5% organic.

Pain Therapies increased mid-single digits, with high-single digit growth in Targeted Drug Delivery and mid-single digit growth in Pain Stim. Interventional decreased mid-single digits on product availability challenges and competitive pressure. Brain Modulation decreased low-single digits, as significant declines of replacement devices were partially offset by increased share of initial implants from the continued adoption of the Percept™ PC deep brain stimulation (DBS) system and SenSight™ directional DBS lead system.DiabetesDiabetes revenue of $556 million decreased 5% as reported and increased 3% organic. U.S. revenue declined low-double digits, given the absence of new product approvals. This was offset by mid-teens growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-double digit growth in emerging markets. International sales were driven by high-teens growth of insulin pumps, low-twenties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products, and high-single digit growth in consumable sales.GuidanceThe company today issued revenue growth guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year and updated its fiscal year 2023 EPS guidance range.The company expects fiscal year 2023 second half revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.0% on an organic basis, an acceleration over the first half. If foreign currency exchange rates as of the beginning of November hold, revenue growth in fiscal year 2023 would be negatively affected by approximately $1.740 billion to $1.840 billion versus the previously stated $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion impact.The company now expects fiscal year 2023 diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.30. EPS guidance includes an estimated 18 cent negative impact from foreign currency at rates as of the beginning November.""We continue to expect organic revenue growth acceleration, with the second half growing faster than the first. However, given a slower pace of market and supply recovery, we're reducing our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year,"" said Karen Parkhill, Medtronic chief financial officer. ""On the bottom line, we are driving expense reductions throughout the company to help offset the lower revenue and the effects of cost inflation.

136,c7a97e87-0a5c-303c-bbaa-c9a8b73f8be2,CCI,2022-11-22,Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) investors are sitting on a loss of 21% if they invested a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-nyse-cci-investors-110127161.html,1669114887,STORY,['CCI'],"[Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 13% in the last month. But that doesn't alter the fact that returns have lagged the market over the last year. Specifically, the stock returned 21% whereas the market is down , having returned (-21%) over the last year.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Even though the Crown Castle share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.We don't see any weakness in the Crown Castle's dividend so the steady payout can't really explain the share price drop. From what we can see, revenue is pretty flat, so that doesn't really explain the share price drop. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Crown CastleWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Crown Castle, it has a TSR of -21% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 21% received by Crown Castle shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Crown Castle better, we need to consider many other factors.

KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the trial’s primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone in the all-randomized patient population at a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) were also observed in the all-randomized patient population.The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and will be submitted to regulatory authorities.""Despite improvements in cancer care, advanced gastric cancer continues to have one of the lowest five-year survival rates, and new interventions are urgently needed. The results from KEYNOTE-859 show the potential of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy to improve survival beyond chemotherapy alone for patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, regardless of PD-L1 expression,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We are excited by these new results that demonstrate our commitment to exploring new treatment options for patients fighting gastrointestinal cancers with KEYTRUDA and thank all investigators and patients who participated in this trial.""Story continuesMerck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers, which includes KEYNOTE-811 in first-line advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer, KEYNOTE-585 in early-stage gastric cancer, and further exploration in advanced/metastatic gastric cancer in LEAP-015. Merck is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in hepatobiliary, esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.About KEYNOTE-859KEYNOTE-859 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03675737) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoint is OS, and secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 1,579 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for up to approximately two years) in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, or placebo in combination with chemotherapy.About gastric cancerGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until an advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90-95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with nearly 1.1 million new cases diagnosed and more than 768,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be more than 26,000 new cases of gastric cancer diagnosed and more than 11,000 deaths from the disease in 2022. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis.

Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality.

If the melanoma is BRAF mutation-positive, it should have also been treated with prior BRAF or BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy.This delay is due to the FDA’s comments regarding supplemental assay validation information and comparability data for lifileucel. Per management, the company can promptly address the regulatory body’s comments, which will result in an extension of its anticipated BLA filing timeline. Iovance expects the rolling submission to be completed in first-quarter 2023. Management had announced that it expected the filing to be completed this year in the fourth quarter.Shares were down due to the delay in the filing timeline. In the year-to-date period, shares of Iovance have plunged 65.3% year to date compared with the industry’s 19.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf the BLA is approved, lifileucel will be the first FDA-approved individualized, one-time cell therapy for melanoma patients. It willalso be Iovance’s first-ever therapy to receive FDA approval. An approval to lifileucel will help cater to the needs of melanoma patients who have already been treated with standard-of-care medications and have limited treatment options.Lifileucel is also being evaluated in other clinical studies. Iovance intends to start a phase III study by this year’s end to evaluate lifileucel in combination with Merck’s MRK blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The late-stage study will evaluate the lifileucel-Merck’s Keytruda combo as apotential treatment for immune checkpoint inhibitor naïve frontline metastatic melanoma. IOVA already evaluated this combination for the given indication in a cohort of the phase II study (IOV-COM-202). Data from the cohort demonstrated an overall response rate of 67%.Story continuesA multi-center study, IOV-COM-202 is composed of seven cohorts evaluating Iovance’s TIL therapies in multiple settings and for several indications, as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s Keytruda or Bristol-Myers’ BMY Opdivo/Yervoy.Opdivo and Yervoy are two of the many blockbuster drugs marketed by Bristol Myers.

Shares of Imago and-- Imago BioSciences and Merck here-- after the company announced an agreement to be acquired by Merck in a cash deal with a value of $1.35 billion, now Merck is going to pay $36 for each Imago share that's more than Imago's closing price. Is it ""Image-Go"" or ""Ima-Go""? I'm still trying to figure that out.JULIE HYMAN: ""Ih-MA-go.""BRAD SMITH: ""Ih-MA-go.""BRIAN SOZZI: I like ""ih-MA-go."" It's the Julie Hyman trade here with the biotechs.BRAD SMITH: The pronunciation is sketchy right now. But at least on the Merck side, year to date, Merck has been doing well. Year to date, it's up by about 35%, 36%. You also have a period where over the next couple of years, you're going to see these patent roll-offs, which is going to be significant in terms of the number of deals that Merck is going to be looking for as well. And in Keytruda, 2028 is when that patent rolls off. And that's a significant driver of revenue for them.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, you know, it's really interesting the strategy that you're seeing from some of these large biotech companies. They have something like a Keytruda, which has a lot of customers out there, a lot of patients out there. And then what some of the large companies are doing is focusing on these more rare diseases, cancer as well, which unfortunately, obviously, affects a lot of people.But this particular company is making therapies for something called myeloproliferative neoplasms, which affects the bone marrow's production of platelets and red blood cells. So we're talking about a relatively rare condition. But that also makes it more sort of protected, if you will. In other words, there's not as much of a patent threat for some of these rare disease treatments as there would be for something that is such a big market, like a [INAUDIBLE] or like an Alzheimer's treatment, for example. So you see this kind of activity by some of the big drug companies.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: And Pfizer has spent billions of dollars this year-- this past year buying Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, a global blood therapeutic. It's billions of dollars here to further its leadership in these areas. Boy, every time I talk about this segment, I'm reminded by how little I know about my body. Just hearing these segments, I'm like, wow, I don't really know anything.BRAD SMITH: You're going to find out a lot more because--BRIAN SOZZI: I don't want to find out.BRAD SMITH: --Merck is going to continue spending.

145,1c79b7a5-546e-34e3-a575-e00531d3f1f9,MOS,2022-11-22,Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-185706140.html,1669057026,STORY,['MOS'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Mosaic's (NYSE:MOS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 12% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Mosaic's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mosaic is:32% = US$3.7b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.32 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Mosaic's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Mosaic has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 18% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Mosaic's exceptional 55% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.We then compared Mosaic's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 12% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MOS fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Mosaic Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Mosaic has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 3.4%, meaning that it has the remaining 97% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Moreover, Mosaic is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 14% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 7.6%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Mosaic's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. As per Vantage Market Research in a report dated July 27, the global fertilizer market will experience growth in the future given the sudden changes in crop prices, higher global nutrient demand, and the unexpected surge in energy prices. In addition to that, demand for food will multiply, driven by a growing population and this will potentially advance the growth of the fertilizer market in the years to come. Vantage Market Research expects the global fertilizer market to reach $219.4 billion by 2028 and is forecasted to exhibit a compound annual growth rate of 2.3% during the forecast period. In 2021, the global fertilizer market was worth approximately $191.5 billion. On the basis of region, the Asia Pacific is anticipated to dominate the worldwide fertilizer market.Russia is the world’s largest supplier of fertilizers and their primary components. It accounts for approximately 45% of the global ammonia nitrate market, 18% of the potash market, and 14% of global phosphate fertilizer exports. The Russia supply shock will inflate fertilizer and chemical prices further, given that the West and Europe are trying to cut reliance on the country. This will create upside for fertilizer firms like Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS). Our Methodology We selected the fertilizer stocks that are most popular amongst elite hedge funds. We have mentioned the analyst ratings, business fundamentals, and future growth prospects for each firm. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. 9 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by CDC on UnsplashBest Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds9.

(NYSE:CMP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Compass Minerals International, Inc. (NYSE:CMP): Despite a strong winter season in which salt volumes came in higher than expectations buoyed by a more normalized snowfall year, higher logistics and freight costs negatively impacted the bottom line. Within their plant nutrient segment, margins remained strong driven by strong potash pricing, however drought conditions negatively impacted overall volumes. Looking ahead, CMP should benefit from improved pricing during the upcoming salt selling season while actions taken within their plant segment to improve efficiencies should help improve overall results. Finally, the company is making progress in the development of its Lithium assets, supported by a recent offtake agreement with a leading global manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries which we believe is not reflected in the current stock price.”6. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) was founded in 1883 and is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is an agricultural sciences company that offers crop protection, plant health, pest control, and turf management products. It is one of the best fertilizer stocks to monitor. On November 1, FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.23 and a revenue of $1.38 billion, outperforming market estimates by $0.12 and $50 million, respectively. For full-year 2022, the company raised its revenue outlook to $5.6 billion-$5.8 billion, reflecting 13% growth at the midpoint versus 2021. This is up from the prior outlook of $5.5 billion-$5.7 billion, whereas the revenue consensus stood at $5.63 billion.  Loop Capital analyst Christopher Kapsch on November 15 upgraded FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $149, up from $132. The previous downgrade was due to his belief that the stock's valuation had gotten ahead of the story, but FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) has executed nicely, which has de-risked its earnings progression, the analyst told investors. He added that he now sees higher upside in FMC shares, particularly given the potential to close a valuation gap compared to Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA). According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were bullish on FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 29 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $130 million. In addition to Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) is one of the fertilizer stocks backed by elite hedge funds. Here is what Miller Value Partners Deep Value Strategy has to say about FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We also believe that a lot of Energy equities remain mispriced. The sector generated negative returns in four of the last six years (2015, 2017, 2018, and 2020). Even with a strong 2021 and start to 2022, the Energy sector 10-year returns at the end of the 2nd quarter are only 4.3% versus 18.7% for Technology and 13% for the overall S&amp;P 500. Our two energy holdings – Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) and TechnipFMC (NYSE:FMC) – are oil service companies that recently experienced multi-year trough conditions. Given the delayed industry Capital Expenditure (“capex”) recovery, both companies have only recently seen higher utilization rates, improved pricing, higher margins, and growing backlogs. It is also important to note that their revenue isn’t directly tied to a commodity price but to industry capital spending trends. Both management teams see a multi-year positive industry capex cycle with oil prices greater than $70/share. Nabors and TechnipFMC share prices are still 75% below their 5-year highs, at low single-digit cash flow multiples, and normalized free cash flow yields in excess of 30%. Both companies have significant price-to-value gaps that offer the potential to generate very positive long-term returns.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:11 Best Coal Stocks To Buy Now16 Best Gambling Stocks To Buy12 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 9 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The sector is made up of a number of different companies and organizations, each with its own specialties. The defense sector of Europe is a major contributor to the economy, employing thousands of people and generating billions of euros in revenue each year. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, defense spending in Europe amounted to $417.8 billion in 2021, making it rank among the continents with the highest defense spending in the world. Moreover, country-wise, Russia, France, Germany, the UK, and Italy have dominated the share of global defense spending each year throughout history and have invested most heavily in the research and development of weaponry and military assets. Mordor Intelligence expects the European defense market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3% from 2022 through 2027.Furthermore, Mordor Intelligence expects Russia to dominate the market share of the European defense market throughout the forecasted period. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a further catalyst in this trend since Russia has been excessively utilizing cluster bombs, rockets, and artilleries to support itself in the war, and is consequently causing a surge in demand for weaponry.Russia is expected to hold the major market share of the European defense market, followed by the United Kingdom, and France. Other prominent countries that are expected to account for a major share include Germany, Ukraine, and Poland.

Being a carrier means you inherited an abnormal copy of a gene from one parent, but you show no symptoms because you got a normal copy of that gene from your other parent. But if you reproduce with another carrier of the same disorder, there's a 25% chance your child will inherit two abnormal copies of the same gene and develop symptoms.The most common of these ""autosomal recessive disorders,"" cystic fibrosis, is often fatal. In the United States about 2500 babies are born with it every year, and on average, they don't live past age 30. About one in 20 Americans is an unaffected carrier who risks passing the disease on to their children2-and they usually have no idea.Genetic screening can inform us about these possibilities. Prospective parents can test before conception, and embryos produced through in vitro fertilization can be tested. Genetic screening has become more affordable over time, DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies are only getting faster and more efficient, but one bottleneck remains: a lack of genetic counselors who can interpret and educate about the test results. Data presented in 2018 showed that the US had just one genetic counselor per 81,700 people, and there are still fewer than 8000 genetic counselors worldwide. Considering the crucial role that carrier screening can play in health care, what can be done to address this shortage?If there aren't enough human brains to do the job, maybe a silicon one could help. Founded in 2016, Igentify is a digital health company that's developed a platform that scales the genetic counseling process. The platform can digitally educate patients about the genetic test they'll receive, register patients and obtain their consent for screening, analyze their genomic data to identify those at risk, create lab reports, and for the majority of patients who are low-risk or test negative, the platform can generate personalized animated videos explaining individual results-­­eliminating the need to schedule and conduct a face-to-face follow-up appointment with a genetic counselor.Story continuesThe Igentify platform is a configurable, DNA-to-results genomic medicine workflow, with components that benefit patients, labs, and genetic counselors. The personalized education and patient result videos it offers draw from a vast library of individual story components, created by Igentify's own animators, to seamlessly tailor videos to each patient's circumstances, in multiple languages. The shareable, rewatchable three-to-eight-minute videos explain the patient's test results, including definitions and suggested next steps ""all in regular language I-or any patient-can understand, not super-technical terms,"" says Amanda Swiatocha, Igentify's vice president of marketing.Co-Founder and CEO Dr. Doron Behar says Igentify's platform could free up vast amounts of time by absorbing tedious, repetitive tasks, so the human genetic counselors we do have can focus on the patients who are most at risk. His aim is for the platform to be ""the autonomous driving of the field of genomics.""One might guess the average person would prefer a face-to-face appointment over an automated video, but the company's data reveal the opposite. In a clinical study of 225 couples who requested preconception genetic screening, 94% of the couples reported being comfortable receiving their results through video. And of the 165 couples who turned out not to be carriers of the same abnormal gene, 156 of them didn't need face-to-face counseling.""People are quite busy,"" Behar remarks, smiling. ""None of us today has time to look at something-even six minutes people tell me is too much. They want to know the answer very fast. And many people are afraid of the human interaction between patient and provider, which, of course, is a holy principle of medicine. But we live in reality, and the reality is, health care providers have very limited time for each patient, and patients have limited time, too."" Plus, it doesn't take a research study to know that younger generations prefer to consume content digitally; videos can communicate more information in less time by including graphics and charts than a counselor could through words alone.Igentify will interpret results generated by the Illumina Global Diversity Array with Carrier Screening Content v2 (intended for research use only), a single product that screens for 600 different autosomal recessive disorders. It boasts a low residual risk for key disorders and a high detection rate for both sequence and structural variants.Any given genetic condition may be rare on its own, ""but cumulatively we're speaking about one in 300 kids being born with some kind of recessive genetic disorder,"" Behar explains, ""half of which (1 in 600) are severe. These are the genes we're trying to target.""Of course, technology like this can only help a couple if they know about them. And the key to public awareness, Behar says, is ""campaigns, campaigns, campaigns."" The National Society of Genetic Counselors is leading on that front, spreading the word with efforts like Genetic Counselor Awareness Day on the second Thursday of November, when it hosts webinars, offers a media tool kit, and promotes other resources.Behar started his career as an internal medicine and critical care physician, but pursued his PhD in population genetics and then a medical residency in genetics because rather than treating the sick, he says, ""I want to treat the healthy population. Why? Prevention. Prevention is the best treatment. The most important thing, for me, is to have actionable information early enough to give a couple all the potential treatment modalities, so they can make an informed decision.""Illumina, Monday, November 21, 2022, Press release pictureImage source: Igentify.To find out more about the Igentify platform, visit igentify.com.Learn more about how Illumina is expanding access to genomics, click here.Referenceshttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/autosomal-recessive-disorderhttps://www.cdc.gov/scienceambassador/documents/cystic-fibrosis-fact-sheet.pdfIllumina, Monday, November 21, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727532/Addressing-the-Shortage-of-Genetic-Counselors-With-Software]"

Recently, CI broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.Moving Average Chart for CICI could be on the verge of another rally after moving 5.9% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Once investors consider CI's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has been lowered in the past two months, compared to 10 raised estimates, for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has increased as well.Investors should think about putting CI on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A bold, decades-long shift to open up luxury’s shopper base to younger customers has dramatically exploded the sector and transformed the business of luxury goods.Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, and the power of streetwearBalenciaga may have started out selling ballgowns, but it has undergone a streetwear-savvy makeover and now hawks sneakers and kitschy trash bags, too. Louis Vuitton, which began as a premium leather luggage specialist, surprised the industry when it collaborated with Supreme in 2017 in a pivot to a much younger crowd. Now, it regularly includes cotton t-shirts and fragrances as part of its collection.Story continues Left: A Balenciaga look from 1955, Right: Balenciaga in 2022. Left: A Dior look from 1947, Right: Dior in 2022In 2019, millennials and Gen Z accounted for 40% of luxury shoppers in North America, and 44% for the industry globally, according to joint research by the consulting firm Bain &amp; Co. and the Italian luxury goods association Altagamma. These generations are expected to account for as much as 70% of the global luxury market by 2025.The youthfulness of China’s luxury market has been even starker. According to a joint study by BCG &amp; Tencent, in 2015, two-thirds of luxury customers in China were under the age of 35. By 2021, the market had grown even younger. Half of China’s luxury buyers last year were born after 1990.This broadening of the customer base has allowed the global luxury industry to more than triple its revenues from €43 billion ($44 billion) in 2000 to €130 billion ($133 billion) in 2021, according to research by Bank of America. It has swelled LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault’s fortune so that he now comfortably maintains a position in the top three of the world’s richest. (For a time in 2021, he was the wealthiest person on the planet.)And there’s still more room for luxury to grow. Bank of America predicts that the youth-focused strategy adopted by the industry in the last two decades has doubled luxury’s total addressable market to €365 billion ($374 billion).“Thirty years ago, there were voices saying that luxury has no future, because luxury was really that rich aristocratic European or East Coast lady who wore big gowns, [with her] husband in a tuxedo, and who went to big galas,” says Michael Kliger, CEO of MyTheresa, a luxury fashion online retailer. “That continues to be a lifestyle, but a very limited lifestyle.”“You can go running in Gucci”The huge success of luxury, particularly at big groups like LVMH and Kering—the former owns labels including Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs, as well as Louis Vuitton, and brands owned by the latter include Balenciaga, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen—was to expand the selection of products so people had the option to wear it in many different situations, Kliger explains.“You can go running in Gucci, you can go to lunch in Stella McCartney and [to] your studio,” Kliger says. “You can have casual luxury; it’s not always a suit.”Although luxury inherently encompasses an element of exclusivity—and brands seek to main that aura at all costs—luxury goods have become ubiquitous.Companies can pull this off by including enough accessibly priced options. Dior, for example, sells a pair of shoes for $470 or a cardholder for $390 so that first-time buyers can get a taste of the brand, while catering to their core customer set with a dress from the/ /ready-to-wear collection that can easily cost $5,000. Haute couture, which is entirely custom-made, can fetch into the tens or even hundreds of thousands.Fashion resale sites have also helped to groom a younger customerBy offering a more affordable entry point into owning designer goods, resale companies like Fashionphile are part of the pivot to young shoppers too.“You really can buy vintage Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Fendi, Balenciaga, and even Chanel for less than $500,” says Davis. “My son can’t afford to buy luxury full retail, but he buys and sells sneakers and buys designer items second hand.”The growth of online resale platforms Vestiare Collective and StockX has helped develop the aftermarket. In the process, they’ve enabled second-hand to lose a lot of its stigma too. In fact, Gen Z’s eco-consciousness and desire to wear unique goods to express individuality means they sometimes might even prefer it to buying a new season look straight off the rack.Brands expanded into many new categories like sneakers and kidswearBut more so than the wider acceptance of pre-owned, it’s luxury’s expansion into new categories that has and been driving growth, namely in streetwear and children’s wear.Bank of America estimates the luxury sneaker market grew from €3 billion in 2016 to roughly €7.7 billion in 2021, meaning a heady 21% compound annual growth rate. Luxury footwear overall, on the other hand, only saw average yearly growth of 3%, while footwear at large grew 2% in that same time period.In 2021, sneakers accounted for around 8% of luxury goods but 30% of initial purchases, highlighting their strong ability to attract new customers to the luxury world.Dior was a first mover when it started a kids line in 1967, but children’s wear launches have picked up the pace. At least 12 major fashion brands have launched designer clothes for tots and babies in the past two decades. Luxury ecommerce marketplace Farfetch quadrupled the number of childrenswear brands on its marketplace from 2016 to 2017, while another similar luxury ecommerce player Mytheresa launched its kidswear offering in 2018.Despite the recent rise in luxury childrenswear collections, it is still a relatively untapped category, with luxury comprising 3.5% of the global childrenswear market versus 7.6% of the total apparel &amp; footwear market. As these children grow, so does the opportunity. The younger people are started on luxury, the more lifetime spend a brand can earn from a customer.Other expansions into beauty, home, and athleisure further lowered the bar for entry-level shoppers. People who can’t afford a $5,000 suit may still be able to afford a $200 candle or a $60 lipstick. Regular Loewe might be out of reach but the On Running x Loewe collaboration could be accessible to a shopper outside luxury’s historical demographic.Culture’s luxury vibe shiftThere’s also an undeniable cultural component to the embrace of luxury by young people. Social media has allowed people to peek into the ultra wealthy’s lives in a way that normalizes big consumption habits. Whether that’s a member of the Kardashian clan toting an ostrich leather Hermes Birkin to board a private jet, Ariana Grande singing about her diamonds, or Cardi B rapping about Gucci and Prada bags, luxury flexes are seemingly everywhere.This has had a profound effect on American shoppers in particular. Anish Melwani, the CEO of LVMH USA, says that when he first joined the luxury conglomerate seven years ago, the level of awareness in American culture of luxury was much lower than across the Atlantic. At the time, LVMH even viewed the US as a sort of emerging market for luxury. “Luxury has just become much more visible,” Melwani said in a wide-ranging interview with Quartz in October. “I don’t remember growing up hearing luxury brands in popular music the way that you do now. I think Gen Z is is growing up and has references to luxury in what they consume as popular culture, whether it be through music, movies, [or] social media.”Bank of America’s analysis of Billboard year-end Hot 100 singles found that mentions of luxury brands and luxury product has skyrocketed in recent years, with a visible upward trend starting from the early 2000s. Meanwhile, the bank’s researchers found that 13 of the top 20 most followed Instagram accounts put a spotlight on the luxury goods industry one way or another.The bank also compared name drops of luxury fashion goods to cars brands. In the 1970s, there was just one luxury brand mentioned in the Billboard year-end Hot 100 singles, while 44 car brands got mentioned. By the 2000s, there were 123 luxury brands mentioned vs. 317 car brands. And in the 2020s, there have been an average of 817 luxury brands mentioned per year, compared to 630 car brands, reflecting Gen Z’s growing disinterest in cars relative to its embrace of designer clothes and accessories.The peak year for luxury brand mentions in hit songs was 2017. But the song Gucci Gang, which came out the year after, takes the cake for most mentions. It references Gucci 104 times over 2 minutes and 10 seconds.datawrapper-chart-0LNFdBeyonce’s 2022 album Renaissance also demonstrates luxury’s new resonance. There were 22 mentions of luxury brands in her songs on that album, but none in her 2003 album Dangerously in Love, Bank of America found. It’s also worth noting that last year, Beyonce and her rapper-husband Jay Z were tapped by Tiffany &amp; Co. for a massive advertising campaign to re-energize the jeweler.Luxury companies are likely to get louder tooJust how were luxury labels able to infiltrate the zeitgeist so powerfully? Selling to the rich, as it turns out, is a good business that holds up better than the rest of retail when the economy stalls. Shoppers who can afford expensive wardrobes are less affected by downturns, so revenue and margins tend to remain strong. Brands reinvest this revenue into bolstering future brand desirability, which in turn fuels more revenue growth, thus creating a positive feedback loop.Last year, luxury companies spent over €12 billion on advertising, more than double their €5.7 billion ad budget from 10 years ago, according to Bank of America. From 2010 to 2019, the group of luxury brands that the bank analyzed increased their ad spending by over 140%, outpacing the 95% growth for advertisers generally, which means Prada, Louis Vuitton, and the like are capturing a larger share of the ad market.If the world tips into a recession, this effect is going to be exacerbated. Many retail companies are turning more conservative in the current economic climate and are trying to trim costs. While not totally immune, luxury companies are set to post 21% revenue growth this year.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy. The sharp decline in the stock market has investors and economists worried about the risks of a possible recession. According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance.

Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

(Nasdaq: ARVN) today announced initial results from the Phase 2 cohort expansion portion (VERITAC) of a phase 1/2 study with ARV-471, a novel PROTAC® estrogen receptor (ER) protein degrader. ARV-471 is being co-developed with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER positive / human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer.This disclosure was originally planned for December 8, 2022. However, on November 21, 2022, the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) incorrectly published the abstract, omitting a key safety data table, and inadvertently released the corresponding full data presentation on the SABCS website. These full data are scheduled to be presented on December 8, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. CT in an oral presentation titled “ARV-471, a PROTAC® estrogen receptor (ER) degrader in advanced ER-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer: phase 2 expansion (VERITAC) of a phase 1/2 study.”As a result of the early release of the full data presentation, Arvinas will host a conference call and webcast today, November 22, 2022, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss these data. Those wishing to examine the data in more detail are welcome to access our 8K filed last evening located here.In the VERITAC trial, ARV-471 shows a favorable tolerability profile and demonstrates a clinical benefit rate of 38% (total n=71) (CBR: rate of confirmed complete response, confirmed partial response, or stable disease &gt; 24 weeks), the primary endpoint in the trial. These results are consistent with the Phase 1 portion of this trial.Story continuesPatients in VERITAC had a median of four lines of prior therapies, in a population where 100% of patients were treated with prior cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4/6) inhibitors, 79% with prior fulvestrant, and 73% with prior chemotherapy.At the time of data cutoff (June 6, 2022), ARV-471 administered at 200 mg (n=35) and 500 mg (n=36) demonstrated:Antitumor activity in 100% CDK4/6 inhibitor-pretreated patients, as measured by a CBR of 38% (total n=71) in all patients and 51.2% in patients with mutant ESR1 tumors (n=41).Preliminary median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 3.7 months, a key secondary endpoint, in all evaluable patients and 5.7 months in patients with mutant ESR1 tumors (n=41).A favorable tolerability profile, with the majority of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) reported as Grade 1 or 2.“I’m gratified to see the continued differentiated profile of ARV-471 and its potential to become an important new standard of care for patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer,” said John Houston, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer at Arvinas. “The positive VERITAC results, in a heavily pre-treated population in which 100% of the patients received at least one prior CDK4/6 inhibitor and many who had progressed on or after chemotherapy, and fulvestrant, reinforce our confidence in ARV-471 as we prepare to initiate two pivotal trials, with the goal of working to give patients and physicians a potential new option in the fight against breast cancer.”“These data validate the early data which led us to enter into the collaboration with Arvinas and give us the confidence needed to initiate two Phase 3 registrational trials,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development.ARV-471 Clinical UpdateStudy DesignVERITAC is the Phase 2 cohort expansion portion of a Phase 1/2 single-arm trial of ARV-471 alone and in combination with palbociclib in patients with ER+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) (NCT04072952). In VERITAC, patients were treated with either 200 mg or 500 mg ARV-471 with a primary endpoint of CBR (CR, PR or SD &gt; 24 weeks). Secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR, PFS and OS as well as safety (AEs) and pharmacokinetics.EnrollmentAs of the data cut-off date of June 6, 2022, 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer in the VERITAC expansion cohort were treated once-daily with oral doses of ARV-471 at 200 mg (n=35) or 500 mg (n=36).100% of patients were previously treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors79% of patients were previously treated with fulvestrant73% of patients were previously treated with chemotherapy45% received chemotherapy in the metastatic settingEfficacy DataClinical benefit rate (the primary endpoint, defined as a confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) in all patients (n=71) and in patients with tumors harboring ESR1 mutations (n=41):All patients (200 mg and 500 mg, n=71): 38%Patients with tumors harboring ESR1 mutations (n=41): 51.2%Patients with ESR1 wild-type tumors (n=25): 20%All patients at 200 mg (n=35): 37.1%Patients with tumors harboring ESR1 mutations (n=19): 47%All patients at 500 mg (n=36): 39%Patients with tumors harboring ESR1 mutations (n=22): 55%Progression free survival All patients receiving 200 mg or 500 mg qd ARV-471 (n=71): median 3.7 monthsPatients with mutant ESR1 tumors (n=41): median 5.7 monthsPatients receiving 200 mg qd ARV-471 (n=35): median 3.5 monthsPatients with mutant ESR1 tumors (n=19): median 5.5 monthsAt the time of the data cutoff, data for 500 mg cohort were immature and therefore not included in a separate analysisSafety DataARV-471 was well tolerated across both dose levels.

A replay of the webcast will be archived on the Arvinas website following the presentation.About ARV-471ARV-471 is an investigational, orally-bioavailable PROTAC® protein degrader designed to specifically target and degrade the estrogen receptor (ER) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer.In preclinical studies, ARV-471 demonstrated near-complete ER degradation in tumor cells, induced robust tumor shrinkage when dosed as a single agent in multiple ER-driven xenograft models, and showed superior anti-tumor activity when compared to a standard of care agent, fulvestrant, both as a single agent and in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of ARV-471; Arvinas and Pfizer will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits.About ArvinasArvinas is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapies that degrade disease-causing proteins. Arvinas uses its proprietary PROTAC® Discovery Engine platform to engineer proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTAC® targeted protein degraders, that are designed to harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins. In addition to its robust preclinical pipeline of PROTAC® protein degraders against validated and “undruggable” targets, the company has three investigational clinical-stage programs: bavdegalutamide (ARV-110) and ARV-766 for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; and ARV-471 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

And while Soros has given away much of his fortune to philanthropic causes (some $30 billion+), his net worth today is a not-too-shabby ~$8.50 billon.So, when Soros goes stock shopping, investors are obviously keen to see what’s in his bag. The billionaire recently loaded up on two stocks, and we used TipRanks’ database to find out what the analyst community has to say about them. As it turns out, Soros is not the only one taking the bullish view here; both get the thumbs from the analysts and boast Strong Buy consensus ratings.Biohaven Ltd. (BHVN)Merger and acquisition activity can shake up the markets, and the first Soros pick has recently been involved in such action. Biohaven, Ltd. is a spin-off of the parent company Biohaven, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical research company that was bought out by Pfizer earlier this year. Pfizer took control of the parent firm’s full portfolio of anti-CGRP assets, while allowing the remainder to spin off as Biohaven Ltd., trading under the BHVN ticker, with Pfizer holding a 3% share of the spun-off stock.On its own hook, Biohaven Ltd. retains a solid portfolio of drug candidate assets. These include potential treatments for a variety of neurological and psychological conditions, including epilepsy, mood disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a late-stage program in the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In addition, the company has developmental programs in the pre-clinical stages.Story continuesThe company expects to complete enrollment of two Phase 3 studies next year, both in the use of drug candidate troriluzole in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The trials are expected to enroll a total of 1,300 patients across 200 global study sites. The company also has a Phase 3 study of taldefgrobep alfa ongoing, in the treatment of SMA. This study has a target enrollment of 180 patients.Additionally, Biohaven Ltd. is looking to complete the Phase 1 trials of BVH-7000 in the first half of 2023. On successful completion of these trials, in the treatment of epilepsy, the company aims to initiate at least one pivotal trial, also in 2023.To fund these programs, and to launch the new ticker, Biohaven Ltd. held a public offering of stock last month, putting 28.75 million shares of BHVN on the market at $10.50 per share. Gross proceeds from the sale, before deductions, came to $301.9 million.All of this caught the eye of George Soros. His firm bought 1,017,534 shares of the company in Q3. This is not a new position for the legendary investor; Soros first got into this ticker in Q2 of this year; clearly, he sees the Pfizer transaction and Biohaven spin-off as an opportunity. His recent buy represents an 81% increase in his total holding of the stock, which is now worth over $32 million.Soros is not the only bull on this stock. The merger and spinoff have also caught the attention of Cantor's Charles Duncan. While the 5-star analyst believes the rest of the pipeline is in the “show me” category, BHV-7000 is the “most-valuable pipeline asset.”“Looking ahead,” said Duncan, “the key potential value creating milestone for us will be the P1 data for BHV-7000. Based on our conversations with the company, the observations of note will relate to safety/tolerability as well as phamacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), which should generate enough information to select doses and titration schedules for the eventual P3 studies. We expect to see these data in 1H23 and for Biohaven to initiate its P3 trials in 2H23. In addition, we expect to see P3 data from troriluzole for OCD in 2023 and taldefgropeb alfa for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in 2024, which could provide upside to our current thesis.”A valuable asset and plenty of near- to mid-term catalysts are positives for this company, and Duncan rates the shares as Overweight (i.e. Buy). His price target, of $27, implies a robust upside of 91% in the next 12 months. (To watch Duncan’s track record, click here)Overall, BHVN has picked up 3 analyst reviews – and they are unanimous that this is a stock to Buy, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are trading for $14.10 and their average target of $24.33 suggests that a one-year gain of ~73% lies ahead. (See BHVN stock forecast on TipRanks)Booking Holdings (BKNG)The next Soros pick we’ll look at is Booking Holdings, a leading online travel company. Booking is a holding company, and its subsidiary brands include Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, Kayak, and OpenTable. Customers can use these sites to access rooms, flights, meals, and other services world-wide, and the brands can connect with customers everywhere. Services are offered in more than 40 languages and include over 6.6 millions listings of homes, apartments, and other accommodations.In recent quarters, Booking Holdings has consistently reported year-over-year quarterly revenue increases, reflecting the lifting of COVID lockdowns and the related surge in business and leisure travel. In the most recent reported quarter, 3Q22, the company had a top line of $6.05 billion, up 29% from 3Q21. For the first nine months of this year, the 3-quarter revenue total of $13.04 billion marked a 63% increase from the same period last year.In addition to revenues, the company reported strong earnings. Net income, at $1.67 billion, was more than double the year-ago value of $769 million, while the non-GAAP EPS, at $53.03, was up 41%. While liquid assets were down from the $11.1 billion reported at the end of last year, the company still has over $9.02 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30 this year.Standing squarely in the bull camp, Soros' fund pulled the trigger on the stock for the first time, buying up 10,800 shares. As for the value of this new position, it comes in at $20.95 million.Looking at this stock for Evercore ISI, 5-star analyst Mark Mahaney has taken note of the company’s strengths – especially its potential to ‘steer through stormy weather.’“We continue to like BKNG given its newer investments (merchandising, flights, cross-selling) that should support above pre-COVID growth in terms of Room Nights, Bookings, Revenue and EPS as conditions normalize. We also believe the material progress BKNG has made in driving more traffic directly to its site – e.g. 45% of Bookings are now via its Mobile app, up from 35% back in ’19 – carries very significant EBITDA Margin expansion implications,"" Mahaney noted.""There is clear discretionary consumer spend risk here, but strong valuation support should help, along with a management team and a business model that have been fully tested over the last 20+ years,"" the analyst added.These comments back up Mahaney’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares, and his price target, now set at $2,600, implies an upside potential of 34% on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Mahaney’s track record, click here)Overall, BKNG gets a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 recent analyst reviews from the Street. These reviews include 13 Buys over just 4 Holds. The shares are trading at $1,940 and change and the average price target of $2,650, slightly more bullish than Mahaney’s, indicates potential for ~19% upside by the end of next year.

Its subscriptions and total hours watched grew 45% and 70% year over year, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2023, making it FOX Nation’s highest quarter ever for hours watched. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.It released original content like Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back and Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner to expand its existing library and now awaits the release of Christmas at The Greenbrier, the second feature film from Fox News’ subscription streaming platform, which will premiere on Nov 24.Story continues Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteBesides this, Fox Business is also benefiting from a growing user base, as it achieved 142 million multiplatform views, delivered over 261 million multiplatform minutes, up 3% year-over-year, and had 19 million multiplatform unique visitors.This let Fox Business surpass Warner Bros Discovery’s WBD CNN Business for seven consecutive months. The latter’s launch of the streaming service CNN+ accounted for a huge loss for the company and was shut down a few months back. Management is still hunting for new sources of revenue.HeadwindsDespite a strong pipeline of content, Fox is suffering from a shift in consumer behavior. Consumers are opting for subscription video-on-demand and advertising-based video-on-demand from multichannel video programming distributors, which Fox is currently using to deliver broadcast and cable networks to consumers.The cable business faces a serious threat from OTT platforms like Netflix NFLX due to cord-cutting, which does not bode well for Fox. Netflix is set to launch its ad-tier subscription for customers by the end of this year. This low-cost subscription is expected to gain traction and the streaming giant currently expects to gain one million paid subscribers in the third quarter of 2022.Fox recently announced the merger with News Corporation NWSA, which not has boded well with the investors. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.Shares of Fox Corporation, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have declined 20.2% year to date compared to the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.6%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Trump made the announcement Tuesday night, saying he wants to give Republicans a fighting chance in the next election. This comes after the Democrats made significant gains in the midterm elections. Consequently, ‘Trump stocks’ are likely to gain big in line with how Trump fares in the political arena over the next couple of years.Politics has taken a beat seat for Wall Street in 2022, with the macroeconomic forces acting as key market drivers. However, with Trump’s smashing entry into the 2024 presidential race, a fair few Trump-linked stocks stand to gain immensely over the next couple of years.

In fact, the company has been linked to being a conservative media outlet for years, and it looks like those ties will only strengthen in the coming years. Trump has always had a strong relationship with Fox News, and the news outlet has often been one of his strongest supporters. So, it’s no surprise that Trump’s 2024 run will be good for Fox Corp. Trump’s candidacy will bring more attention to the network and its affiliates – which can only mean more viewers and higher ratings.From a fundamentals perspective, the media giant has consistently delivered healthy revenue and earnings growth each year. Advertising revenues have been driven by higher political advertising, an area that should demonstrate continued strength for the foreseeable future. Moreover, its stock trades at just 1.2 times trailing-twelve-month sales, roughly 25% lower than its 5-year average.Story continuesBlack Rifle Coffee Company (BRCC)Exterior of Black Rifle Coffee Company Store. BRCC stock.Source: YuniqueB / ShutterstockBlack Rifle Coffee Company (NYSE:BRCC) is a strong brand in the coffee market. BRCC’s competitive strengths come from quality products, effective media platforms, a scalable omnichannel strategy, and a loyal customer base. Hence, it’s in a strong position to compete in the massive $85 billion U.S. coffee industry. The company’s focus on quality and branding has helped it to become a leader in the premium coffee segment. In addition, BRCC’s media platform provides the company with a powerful tool for promoting its brand and connecting with customers.The veteran-founded coffee business went public via a shell company and has often been linked to the conservative party. It has received positive mentions from several popular names in the Republican Party, including Donald Trump Jr., who appeared on BRCC’s podcast. With its conservative slant and a focus on veterans from the armed forces, the firm is likely to deliver long-term gains ahead.Rumble (RUM)Illustrative Editorial of RUMBLE.COM website homepage.

But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. To wit, the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) share price is 26% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 22% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! However, the stock hasn't done so well in the longer term, with the stock only up 7.9% in three years.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last twelve months, International Business Machines actually shrank its EPS by 30%.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment.We haven't seen International Business Machines increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. It seems far more likely that the 42% boost to the revenue over the last year, is making the difference. After all, it's not necessarily a bad thing if a business sacrifices profits today in pursuit of profit tomorrow (metaphorically speaking).The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on International Business MachinesStory continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, International Business Machines' TSR for the last 1 year was 32%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that International Business Machines has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 32% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 5% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - International Business Machines has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.International Business Machines is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

183,333b8bbd-d019-30fc-8243-65e70f93cdf8,IBM,2022-11-22,Top 15 Edge Computing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-edge-computing-companies-145908729.html,1669042748,STORY,"['IBM', 'ANET', 'HPE', 'QLYS', 'FSLY', 'NET', 'ORCL', 'AKAM', 'DELL', 'LUMN', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 edge computing companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Edge Computing Companies in the World. The boom in big data has enabled companies and governments to have massive amounts of data at their disposal. This has opened up new technological avenues for data analysis, mainly cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. A relatively newer form of big data analysis and computing is edge computing. This seeks to bypass the hassles of transferring data all the way from the consumer (or source) to the cloud, and instead, it looks to bring computing closer to the consumer instead.Due to this, the edge computing industry is one of the largest emerging sectors in technology. A research report from Research and Markets estimates that the industry will be worth $155 billion by 2030, after it grows at a remarkable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.9%. The research firm believes that the integration of artificial intelligence into cloud computing will help drive this growth, with industries such as machine control and telecommunications taking charge. For the latter, telecommunication firms will seek to place their computing centers close to their data centers, a development that will further be aided by the growth in fifth generation (5G) communications technology.Another report, this time from Transparency Market Research, estimates that the global edge computing market was worth $6.95 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a 37.3% CAGR and sit at $161 billion by the end of the forecast period, mirroring the conclusions reached by Research and Markets. Transparency Market Research believes that the internet of things (IoT) industry will aid this growth, with connected devices providing more data and requiring the need to place the computing centers closer to the end user.Today's list will focus on some of the top edge computing companies in the world, and it covers hardware, software, and infrastructure providers. Some well known names in the list are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.As part of the transaction, Mercuria will enter into a long-term supply relationship to deliver renewable natural gas (RNG) to Chevron. This will enable CVX to market the RNG it either produces or procures through a nationwide network of CNG locations.Chevron mentioned that this acquisition of Beyond6 complements the energy giant’s strength in its traditional product business with new offerings. These will assist customers in supporting a lower carbon future, of which RNG is an essential part of the company’s portfolio of solutions.Additionally, through partnerships with Brightmark and California Bioenergy, Chevron is developing projects across the United States. These are designed to convert fugitive methane emissions from dairies to beneficial use as RNG, which is considered to be carbon negative on a lifecycle basis under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard.Andy Walz, Chevron’s president of Americas Products, stated that the company has seen robust demand for its RNG-to-CNG fuel offering from new and existing customers. “Because of its carbon negative attribute and the ability of fleet operators to efficiently adapt vehicles to run on CNG, renewable natural gas can be a lower carbon solution for fleets seeking to reduce their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions,” he added.Chevron, the American oil major, is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world with operations spanning worldwide.

QuoteShare RepurchasesBP announced plans to execute a $2.5-billion share buyback program, which is expected to complete before its fourth-quarter results. BP anticipates buying back $1 billion worth of shares every quarter, considering Brent crude price of $60 per barrel.Operational PerformanceOil Production &amp; Operations:For the third quarter, BP reported total production of 1,317 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), marginally up from 1,313 MBoe/d in the year-ago quarter.BP sold liquids at $93.14 a barrel in the third quarter compared with $65.53 in the prior-year period. It sold natural gas at $11.73 per thousand cubic feet compared with $5.61 in the year-ago quarter.

Higher commodity price realizations primarily caused the upside.Gas &amp; Low Carbon Energy:Segmental profits totaled $6,240 million, improving from earnings of $1,807 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily led by increased oil-equivalent production and prices.Story continuesIn the third quarter, the total production of 981 MBoe/d improved from 889 MBoe/d in the year-ago quarter. Key project start-ups primarily contributed to the production.Customers &amp; Products:After adjusting for non-operating items, underlying replacement cost earnings before interest and tax for the segment amounted to $2,725 million, up significantly from $1,158 million in the year-ago quarter. A favorable refining business and an exceptional oil trading contribution aided the segment.BP-operated refining availability at the September-end quarter was 94.3%, reflecting a decline from 95.6% in the year-ago quarter.

186,450f8f20-97bd-33ca-880e-227441b3aefd,MPC,2022-11-22,"EnLink Midstream, LLC (ENLC) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enlink-midstream-llc-enlc-hits-141502345.html,1669040102,STORY,"['MPC', 'ENLC']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of EnLink Midstream (ENLC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $12.75 in the previous session. EnLink Midstream has gained 83.3% since the start of the year compared to the 42.2% move for the Zacks Oils-Energy sector and the 44% return for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 1, 2022, EnLink Midstream reported EPS of $0.18 versus consensus estimate of $0.11 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 29.4%.For the current fiscal year, EnLink Midstream is expected to post earnings of $0.53 per share on $10.07 billion in revenues. This represents a 960% change in EPS on a 50.62% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.74 per share on $10.76 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 40.38% and 6.87%, respectively.Valuation MetricsEnLink Midstream may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.EnLink Midstream has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 24X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 5.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 9.4X versus its peer group's average of 11.2X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, EnLink Midstream currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if EnLink Midstream meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though EnLink Midstream shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does ENLC Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ENLC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC). MPC has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. Marathon Petroleum Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 14.85%, and for the current fiscal year, MPC is expected to post earnings of $16.53 per share on revenue of $171 billion.Shares of Marathon Petroleum Corporation have gained 8.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.74X and a P/CF of 14.9X.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is in the top 6% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ENLC and MPC, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 8.8%, the stock of this refiner is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MPC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 16.1% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MPC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.61. This indicates that the stock moves 61% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that MPC has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MPC earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MPC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MPC is currently trading at 0.32 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 32 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MPC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MPC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

And when you think about the number of instances where we've seen even some films come about because of one pilot that, unfortunately, may be drunk or whatnot, and you know that that's not the standard. It's just those are the instances that you safeguard against, is any type of malpractice from one pilot or just not knowing how to counter a situation.BRIAN SOZZI: Or someone dies.

I mean, we're seeing in so many different industries the difficulty in finding skilled workers. And so this seems to be stemming from the fact that it's difficult to find skilled pilots right now. Obviously, they've--[BUZZER]--got to figure out how to solve that problem.BRAD SMITH: 18 months to two-year backlog--JULIE HYMAN: Wow.BRAD SMITH: --the number of pilots going through training.]"

(NYSE:PNC) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$163). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At PNC Financial Services Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. Specifically, insiders ditched US$1.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$224m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, PNC Financial Services Group makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Colonel Macedonia served 27 years as a regular army officer, medical doctor, and senior scientist in the Pentagon. He earned his medical degree from the Uniformed Services University and completed his advanced imaging and genetics training (Maternal Fetal Medicine) at the National Institutes of Health and Georgetown University where the developed the world's first 3D ultrasound capable of imaging a living fetus. Firmly settled in the Keystone State after leaving government, he set about establishing his medical practice - Lancaster Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) - offering advanced obstetrical imaging and consulting for central Pennsylvania communities.Even with initial success, Dr. Macedonia set an ambitious eye to the future as part of the business plan.""From that very first day, I had a vision of growth for our practice. I wanted it to be more than just a practice,"" said Dr. Macedonia. ""We set out to be a business that grew jobs and had a real impact on the community."" Practice partner Dr. Rob Larkin, an MFM physician of clinical abilities and reputation widely known throughout Lancaster, has played a critical role in this effort.The practice's impact on the community has been extraordinary, with a diverse patient base ranging from college professors to out-of-state visitors, doctors, lawyers, refugees from war-torn regions of the world and members of the local Amish and Mennonite communities.Innovation and technology improve outcomesIn addition to serving a diverse patient demographic ranging from urban to suburban to rural, MFM provides pre- and post-natal care for patients with a variety of medical situations, including high-risk pregnancies as well as those with underlying medical conditions that may require coordinated medical care such as diabetes or high blood pressure. The practice also offers specialized diagnostics, preconception counseling and testing including 3D and 4D ultrasound, fetal echocardiography and genetic counseling.Story continues""Technology is a vital tool in our practice, and the necessary equipment can be expensive,"" said Dr. Macedonia. Though he opted to go with a different lender to finance his initial practice launch, Dr. Macedonia soon realized the value of the relationships he started with PNC bankers along the way, Tom Weikel and Cody Jones.A partnership that goes beyond the numbers""After a series of interactions with my bank at the time, I started to feel like that team's support, particularly upper management was more lip service than anything,"" said Dr. Macedonia. ""I knew if I was going to grow this practice to match my vision, I needed a real partner to achieve my goals, one that shared that vision and recognized its value.""Fortunately, Weikel and Jones had maintained contact and were prepared to step in when MFM took its next step to expand.""The bankers from PNC consistently told me, ‘We're going to take care of you. We're going to make it work. We appreciate your service,'"" said Dr. Macedonia. ""When Tom and PNC say ‘thank you. we're here to take care of you,' that's not just flowery words. That's commitment, the kind of commitment soldiers give each other.""By 2020, the practice was ready to expand to an additional location using its Paycheck Protection Program funding from the Small Business Administration. The second office put its services closer to people living in low- to moderate-income areas of Lancaster, making it the first new medical practice to open in the south of the city in two decades.Dr. Macedonia says that his practice is focused on providing quality medical care regardless of his patients' ability to pay - noting that he's even been paid in shoo-fly pie.""When I forgive - or forgo - payments from patients, there's no tax benefit to me. It's a business expense that I willingly incur,"" said Dr. Macedonia. ""I'm able to do that because of the solid financial foundation I have in place thanks to my partnership with Tom, Cody and PNC.""The amount of effort they put into this project - including the special lending rates for military vets - really made a difference for our practice and for our community,"" said Dr. Macedonia. ""Moving out of leased space and into our new property … that simply would've been impossible with our previous bank.""""What helps me helps my community""Dr. Macedonia is understandably proud of the work that MFM does in the Lancaster community to benefit maternal and fetal health, adding that the practice ""doesn't ever turn patients away. That's why our tagline is ‘Where ALL are welcome, and the future is born.'""Of course, we all recognize that our banking relationship is about money on the surface, but when that money is put into action it is intended to help the women and unborn babies of our community.,"" said Dr. Macedonia. ""We are good stewards of that money, making sure it's used to benefit this community as much as possible. It's very touching and emotional to have this deal come about and PNC has been truly incredible in its support.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info: Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727519/PNC-Helps-a-Medical-Practice-Grow-to-Impact-the-Community]"
199,a41ce192-651f-3ff3-bc62-c3e1a5d0782e,TGT,2022-11-22,"Target (NYSE:TGT) sheds 8.8% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-nyse-tgt-sheds-8-110115572.html,1669114875,STORY,['TGT'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 183% in five years. Unfortunately, though, the stock has dropped 8.8% over a week. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently -- you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.While the stock has fallen 8.8% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Target While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Target achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Target, it has a TSR of 219% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 20% in the twelve months, Target shareholders did even worse, losing 34% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 26%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Target   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Macy's M, Foot Locker FL and Lowe's LOW.Breaking Down Retail Earnings that Highlight Slower Consumer SpendingIt is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy have forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days and weeks ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers 'trading down' to its stores in response to the aforementioned headwinds.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in 'normal' times and these are anything but normal times. They need just the right amount of inventory, otherwise they will either lose sales if they don't have enough merchandise as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart and Target in the summer quarter.Retailers also need to make sure that they have the right type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much stuff like patio furniture that consumers weren't interested in buying any more after the initial pandemic boom. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target and others face daily.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.With respect to the group's Q3 earnings releases, it has been a mixed show overall. In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart was better, Target was not. Macy's, Foot Locker and Lowe's executed really well, but others didn't.Story continuesWith respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 29 of the 34 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index.Unlike the official S&amp;P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks' stand-along Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.5% from the same period last year on +8.6% higher revenues, with 72.4% beating EPS estimates and 58.6% beating revenue estimates.Retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, though it's a better showing relative to what we saw from the group 2022 Q2.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon's weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of the results that came through Friday, November 18th, we now have Q3 results from 476 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 95.2% of the index's total membership.For the 476 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +1.8% from the same period last year on +11.8% higher revenues, with 69.1% beating EPS estimates and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.The EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.Tracking Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China's continuing zero-Covid restrictions.The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.6% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up only +1.6%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can't go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.The above chart shows that earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be down -5.1% below the year-earlier level on +4.6% higher revenues.Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season. Estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis.Since mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.6% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole and -11.5% on an ex-Energy basis.The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.9% since mid-April), Construction (-25.1%), Retail (-18.6%), Industrial Products (-14.3%), Consumer Discretionary (-19.3%) and Aerospace (-13.4%). Overall, estimates have been cut for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors.There are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +2.8% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can't be below the 2022 level; they can be, and based on the current revisions trend, are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in 'real' GDP to automatically result in 'nominal' or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are 'nominal' values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Evaluating Further Downside Risks to Earnings Estimates   Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

206,068b4301-68d1-3fea-9bbd-7d91e3f39c85,ISRG,2022-11-22,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ISRG) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-140021164.html,1669039221.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past month. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Intuitive Surgical's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Intuitive Surgical's moderate 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 17% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Intuitive Surgical fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Intuitive Surgical Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Intuitive Surgical's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

207,b67da528-a819-3e39-96e5-4225c4f65a71,BXP,2022-11-22,SL Green vs. Boston Properties: Which REIT Is The Better Buy?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sl-green-vs-boston-properties-165614631.html,1669049774,STORY,"['BXP', 'SLG', 'SLG-PI']","[After poor performances by real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks in 2022, this could be one of the best times to buy them since the pandemic started in 2020.REIT prices are down and yields have risen, but many REITs have surpassed analysts’ expectations on third-quarter operating results. How do investors know which REITs to buy?Here are two of the leading office REITs, compared by eight different measures to help determine which is the better buy:SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is an office REIT and the largest office landlord in New York City with 62 buildings totaling 33.6 million square feet.Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) is a Boston-based office REIT with nearly 200 properties concentrated in the largest cities from Boston to Seattle. The firm calls itself “the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.”Size and diversity: Boston Properties has three times as many buildings under its portfolio. SL Green’s entire portfolio is in New York City, while Boston Properties’ portfolio is spread across the country. Boston Properties is the clear winner in this category.Long-term performance: Over the past five years, and without reinvesting dividends, SL Green has a total return of -9.96%, while Boston Properties’ total return is -24.82%. While both results are poor, SL Green has outperformed and gets the edge.Recent performance: Over the past five trading days, SL Green stock is up 6.93%, while Boston Properties stock is up 3.38%. Over the past month, SL Green is up 2.27% while Boston Properties is down 0.51%. SL Green gets the edge.Most recent quarterly operating results: Both companies recently reported third-quarter operating results. Boston Properties’ results were:Revenue of $784.4 million (up 8.6% from the third quarter of 2021).Funds from operations (FFO): $299.8 million (up 11% from third quarter of 2021).FFO margin: 38% (in line with third quarter of 2021).Story continuesFFO per share: $1.90 (up from $1.73 in third quarter of 2021).Revenue beat analyst estimates by 3.7%. Earnings per share (EPS) also bested the analyst estimates by a whopping 198%.By contrast, SL Green reported the following third-quarter operating results:Revenue: $190.5 million (flat from the third quarter of 2021).FFO: $114.2 million (down 10.0% from the third quarter of 2021).FFO margin: 60% (down from 67% in the third quarter of 2021).FFO per share: $1.80 (down from $1.97 in the third quarter of 2021).Revenue exceeded analyst estimates by 3.6%. EPS was also better than analyst estimates by 36%.Although both companies surprised to the upside, the clear edge goes to Boston Properties, whose numbers rose or were in line with third-quarter 2021, while SL Green’s numbers were flat or down from the previous year’s third quarter.Current dividend yield: The current dividend yield for SL Green is 9.18%. The current dividend yield for Boston Properties is 5.26%. SL Green clearly wins this category.Dividend growth: Over the past five years, SL Green has raised its annual dividend from $3.45 to $3.73, an increase of 8.1%. In March 2020, it changed its dividend payment schedule from quarterly to monthly. Over the past five years, Boston Properties has raised its annual dividend from $3.20 to $3.92, an increase of 22.5%. The clear edge goes to Boston Properties unless one needs monthly dividends.Dividend coverage by FFO: SL Green’s annual forward FFO is $6.69, and its forward annual dividend is $3.73. Therefore, the dividend payout ratio to FFO is 55%, which is within the 35% to 55% payout range that is usually cited as ideal for a REIT.Boston Properties’ forward annual FFO of $7.51 easily covers the forward dividend yield of $3.92, with a payout ratio of 52.1% — also within the ideal range. Slight edge to Boston Properties.FFO multiple (price/FFO): Similar to a stock’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-FFO (P/FFO) is a measure of a REIT’s current price to its next fiscal year consensus of FFO. The forward P/FFO for SL Green is 6.07. The forward P/FFO for Boston Properties is 9.91. Slight edge to SL Green.So, which is the better REIT to buy? SL Green comes out ahead on both recent and long-term performance, current dividend yield and FFO multiple. On the other hand, Boston Properties excelled in size and diversity, most recent operating results, dividend growth and dividend coverage. So it’s a 4-4 tie, but which categories are the most important?The answer in this competition depends upon your priorities as an investor. If income is your need, SL Green with its higher yield and monthly payments is the better stock to own. Another plus is SL Green’s superior short- and long-term performance, and that could continue with its 6.07 FFO multiple.On the other hand, if future safety is your concern, the edge goes to Boston Properties with its larger size, greater diversity, superior dividend growth and coverage. Its third-quarter results are also a positive factor.Each investor will just have to decide their own priorities and act accordingly.REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Price and EPS SurpriseAnalog Devices, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAnalog Devices, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Analog Devices, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderAnalog Devices’ performance in the fiscal fourth quarter is likely to have benefited from solid demand for high-performance analog and mixed-signal solutions.Strength across consumer, industrial, communications and automotive end markets is expected to have driven ADI’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.The solid momentum of Analog Devices’ precision signal chain, RF portfolios, power franchises, sensing technologies, and wired and wireless connectivity among factory automation applications is expected to have contributed well to its industrial revenues in the quarter under review.The growing traction across BMS and A2B solutions is likely to have driven Analog Devices’ performance in the automotive market in the fiscal fourth quarter.The rising uptake of the Battery Management System (BMS) solution in the electric vehicle space is likely to have been a tailwind.Strength in home entertainment, hearables and wearables is expected to have aided ADI’s performance in the consumer market in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, Analog Devices is likely to have continued gaining on the positive contributions from its Maxim acquisition.The growing deployment of 5G and solid momentum across the HEV platform are expected to have aided ADI’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.However, the weakening momentum across major applications and a leveraged balance sheet are anticipated to have been concerning in the quarter under review.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fintech industry, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Fintech Companies In The World.The fintech industry is growing rapidly as more and more companies are using technology to create innovative financial products and services. Fintech companies are using technology to create new ways to save, invest, and borrow money. They are also using technology to create new ways to pay for goods and services. The fintech industry is changing the way people track their finances, and it is revolutionizing the financial services sector.An Analysis of The Global Fintech IndustryAccording to a report by The Brainy Insights, the global fintech market was worth $115 billion in 2021 and is on track to reach a value of $936.5 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 26.2% from 2022 to 2030. This growth is attributed to the improved infrastructure for making payments and for storing and accessing financial data. This includes factors such as better internet connectivity, improved mobile networks, and advancements in disruptive technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence.Another key driver is the growing investment from both venture capitalists and traditional financial institutions. This investment is helping to fuel the development of new products and services and is also helping to increase awareness of fintech among the general public. According to KPMG, global investments in fintech totaled $210 billion in 2021, up from $125 billion in 2020. The payments segment dominated the share of global fintech investments in 2021 and accounted for $51.7 billion. Investments in blockchain technology and crypto grew from $5.4 billion in 2020 to $30 billion in 2021.Key Trends in The Global Fintech IndustryThere are a few key trends in the fintech industry that are worth noting. First, there is a trend toward more collaboration between traditional financial institutions and fintech startups. This is happening as traditional financial institutions are starting to realize the potential of fintech to disrupt the status quo. They are also seeing the benefit of partnering with fintech companies to bring new products and services to market faster.Story continuesSecond, machine learning and artificial intelligence are being used more and more to help automate financial processes and make better decisions. This is a trend that is likely to continue as fintech companies look for ways to improve their products and services.Third, blockchain technology is starting to gain more traction in the fintech industry. This is because blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the way financial transactions are processed. Blockchain technology is secure, transparent, and efficient, and it has the potential to make a big impact on the financial industry.Finally, there is a trend toward more mobile-centric fintech products and services. This is because more and more people are using their mobile devices to manage their finances. Fintech companies are responding by creating more mobile-friendly products and services. According to EY Global's official Fintech Adoption Index, which is a comprehensive survey of 27,000 consumers across 27 key markers, global consumer adoption of fintech services was recorded at 64% in 2019. 33% of respondents reported that they prefer third-party services over financial institutions, 46% of respondents noted that they are comfortable sharing their bank account details with a third-party organization that provides fintech services, and 68% of respondents voted in favor of using a non-financial services company for financial services.This article will discuss in detail some of the biggest fintech companies in the world.

To fight inflation, Dalio said the Fed will continue raising rates. “And there’ll be real pain, of course.” In an interview at MarketWatch's Best New Ideas in Money Festival, Dalio explained his outlook on the economy:""I do believe that as you raise the interest rate to what's appropriate, that competitiveness is going to drive it down, and then also, it will hurt earnings, it will hurt the economy.""The billionaire investor heralded further doom by stating his belief the Fed will raise its funds rate to between 4-5%, and that the US economy will further worsen in 2023 into a 'stagflationary environment', causing the S&amp;P 500 to pay the price by falling around another 20%. To avoid the aforementioned stagflation environment, Dalio observed that the central bank would need to find some balance between inflation and interest rates.As of the fiscal third quarter of 2022, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates manages $20 billion in 13F securities. Some of the top stocks in the portfolio of Ray Dalio's fund at the end of Q3 2022 included Procter &amp; Gamble Company. (NASDAQ:PG), Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Billionaire Ray Dalio is Dumping These 10 StocksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyThese stocks were sold entirely by Ray Dalio's fund in the third quarter. For each stock we have mentioned the number of shares the fund reported owning in the previous quarter.Story continuesBillionaire Ray Dalio is Dumping These 10 Stocks10. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Number of Shares Owned by Ray Dalio's Fund in Q2: 340.24KeBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is an American multinational e-commerce company based in San Jose, California, that facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.On November 15, MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton initiated coverage of eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) with a Market Perform rating and $44 price target. Morton states that he prefers market share gainers and finds it ""challenging to have an appetite for market share losers."" The analyst doesn't subscribe to the bear case of peak e-commerce penetration and believes e-commerce penetration growth will continue at the historical pace, contending that the internet ""creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for continued share loss once it starts.""42 out of the 920 hedge fund portfolios studied by Insider Monkey during this year’s third quarter had bought eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s shares. The firm's largest investor is D. E. Shaw which owns approximately 5.9 million shares that are worth $218 million.Unlike Procter &amp; Gamble Company. (NASDAQ:PG), Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Ray Dalio seems to have lost confidence in eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), and sold off its shares in Q3 2022.Smead Capital Management, an investment management company, mentioned eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”9. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Number of Shares Owned by Ray Dalio's Fund in Q2: 531.41KSnap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is an American camera and social media company that developed and maintains technological products and services, including Snapchat, Spectacles, and Bitmoji.Earlier this October, UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley lowered the price target on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) to $10 from $14 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares of the company. The analyst sees both ""positives and negatives"" from the quarter, but expects Snap shares to be range-bound pending better visibility. However, he sees the company being well positioned for an eventual recovery.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), with 21.89 million shares worth more than $215 million. Overall, 42 hedge funds reported holding shares in the company at the close of Q3 2022.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund had to say about Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“SNAP shares were our top detractor for the quarter on its July decline from weaker revenue growth relative to guidance (which had been reduced in May) and the fact that management did not provide an outlook for 3Q. Shares subsequently rebounded somewhat as the company announced better-than-expected near-term revenue growth, while announcing a broadbased cost restructuring.Although the company continues to face near-term macro headwinds and difficult year-over-year comparisons from COVID-fueled quarters last year, we believe SNAP can reaccelerate its revenue growth to greater than 20% annually over the next several years. With TTM revenue of $4.5 billion (as compared with Meta’s $120 billion), 347 million daily average users (about 1/10 of Meta’s), and $14 TTM ARPU (about 1/3 of Meta’s), we believe SNAP has a long runway for both revenue growth and expanded profitability as it improves its platform functionality, continues to grow its audience (daily active users continue to grow at a double-digit rate), and expands its monetization.”8. NCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Number of Shares Owned by Ray Dalio's Fund in Q2: 9.81KNCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR), formerly known as National Cash Register, is an American software, consulting and technology company providing several professional services and electronic products.DA Davidson analyst Matt Summerville lowered the price target on NCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR) to $35 from $45 but kept a Buy rating on the company's shares on October 27. According to the analyst, NCR's Q3 results were demonstrative of the continued sizable global challenges, including higher interest rates, outside of the company's control. However, Summerville states that the company's initiatives to address inflation and supply-chain challenges are generating results above what the management had in mind.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey that disclosed having a stake in NCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR) jumped to 49 at the end of the third quarter from 47 at the end of Q2. Glenn W. Welling's Engaged Capital reportedly held the highest stake in the company, worth roughly $84.64 million.Here is what ClearBridge Small Cap Value Strategy has to say about NCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Information technology (IT) proved a headwind to performance, and included the portfolio’s worst performing stock, NCR (NYSE:NCR), during the quarter. Broadly, the increase in interest rates discounted longer-term cash flows, compressed multiples and pressured share prices for the typically more growth-oriented sector. Still others felt pressure for company-specific reasons, such as the market’s disappointment that ATM and point-of-sale software company NCR was no longer the center of a bidding war between two private equity firms. However, we have high conviction in management’s decision to split the company, allowing for each entity to devote greater time and attention to optimizing very profitable and high cash flow generating businesses. We continue to own NCR as we believe the assets, and their respective free cash flow generation, are undervalued regardless of whether it continues as one company or two.”7. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61The world's largest telecommunications company by revenue and the third largest provider of mobile telephone services in the US, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) is an American multinational telecommunications holding company that provides telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide.On October 21, RBC Capital analyst Kutgun Maral lowered the price target on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) to $18 from $20 and kept a Sector Perform rating on the shares. Although the company's Q3 results were ""largely solid,"" the analyst stated that there may be a downside risk to AT&amp;T's prior outlook for 2023 EBITDA and free cash flow.Number of Shares Owned by Ray Dalio's Fund in Q2: 3.39MAccording to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 61 hedge funds were bullish on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) and D. E. Shaw held the biggest position in the company, comprising 11.4 million shares worth nearly $240 million.Here is what Chartwell Investment Partners has to say about AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In the Dividend Equity accounts, the three best performers in Q2 include AT&amp;T (NYSE:T, 2.5%), up 17.1%. AT&amp;T completed the spin off of the WarnerMedia business (HBO, CNN, etc.), and the market seemed to like the “back-to-basics” approach. Also, the telco business is expected to do relatively well in an inflationary environment.”6. Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Number of Shares Owned by Ray Dalio's Fund in Q2: 7.78kAutodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is an American multinational software corporation that provides 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software and services across the globe. It is also partnering with Epic Games to accelerate immersive real-time, or RT, experiences across industries, with an initial focus on AEC.Earlier this September, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz lowered the price target on Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) to $240 from $290 and kept a Buy rating on the shares following the company's annual user conference. According to the analyst, Autodesk's introduction of three new verticalized cloud environments has the potential to more meaningfully transform customer operations as they transition to the cloud over the long-term.By the end of this year’s third quarter, 62 out of the 920 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK). Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) largest investor as of Q3 is Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns 2.89 million shares that are worth $539.79 million.Although Ray Dalio trusts in stocks like Procter &amp; Gamble Company. (NASDAQ:PG), Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the same can't be said for AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), which was sold off from his portfolio in Q3.Arch Capital made the following comment about Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at a specific example. One of our portfolio companies is Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK), a construction/engineering/architecture software business with an incredible moat. Our cost basis on the stock is $230. Shares traded as high as $340 in 2021 but today are down around $200. With this declining share price, Autodesk management has been able to take the healthy free cash flow it generates and retire some of its shares outstanding at an accelerated rate.At the beginning of 2022, Autodesk had approximately 220 million shares outstanding. Today, that number is down to around 216 million, and we expect this number to continue to drop over the next few years as the company ramps up its free cash flow generation. This reduction in share count will juice growth in free cash flow per share, which will determine what returns we get owning Autodesk over the long haul. The lower the stock drops, the faster Autodesk’s share count drops, all else equal.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio is Dumping These 5 Stocks.   Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

219,4bb5bcaf-dfea-37ca-9106-2d5b53f0c6c8,V,2022-11-22,Visa (NYSE:V) Knows How To Allocate Capital Effectively,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-nyse-v-knows-allocate-110104301.html,1669114864,STORY,['V'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Visa (NYSE:V) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Visa, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$20b ÷ (US$86b - US$21b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Visa has an ROCE of 31%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the IT industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for Visa roceIn the above chart we have measured Visa's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Visa here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEVisa is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 43% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Key TakeawayTo sum it up, Visa is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Since the stock has returned a solid 90% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Visa can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesWhile Visa looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

Still, similar to Visa, UNH's 17.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate makes up for the shortfall.Other Noteworthy Cash GeneratorsNow, for those seeking exposure to tech, several companies within the realm also have inspiring free cash flow, including the legendary Microsoftand everybody's favorite, Apple.In Apple's latest release, free cash flow came in at $20.8 billion, reflecting a 22.7% Y/Y uptick.And in Microsoft's latest print, free cash flow was reported at $16.9 billion, representing a 9% Y/Y decline.Bottom LineA company displaying free cash flow strength has freedom for growth opportunities, can consistently shell out dividends, and wipe out debt easily.And when investors are scouting for potential investments, it's undoubtedly a metric worth paying serious attention to.For those seeking companies with strong free cash flow, all three stocks above – Visa, UnitedHealth Group and Exxon Mobil – could be considered.Now, for those seeking exposure to tech, Apple and Microsoft also generate substantial cash, providing additional options for investors.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +9.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has gained 10.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -3.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.12 indicates a change of -1.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.28 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $136.86 billion and $139 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $34.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The disposition price represents a trailing twelve-month NOI cap rate of approximately 4.4%.John McGrath, Chairman of the AIR Investment Committee, noted: ""Since the end of 2020, AIR has completed $2.2 billion of property sales and joint venture transactions at prices averaging 17% above internal estimates of gross asset value as of Q1 2020, which were substantially identical to those prepared and published at that time by Green Street Advisors.

EPS were lower than expected, while guidance was encouraging.Beyond the headline numbers, there were a number of encouraging points to note. Gaming revenue has fallen sharply over the last year, particularly over the last quarter. However, there are signs that customers are working through their inventories, and sales for this segment may start to improve soon.In the face of new restrictions imposed by the US on semiconductor companies exporting to China, the small increase in data center revenue was also good to see.Our take:  By most accounts, Nvidia is still executing very well. But there’s a lot that is beyond the company’s control. In the medium term, market sentiment is likely to outweigh Nvidia’s own performance in determining where the stock price ends up.Over the long term, revenue growth will be key. If there is one company that stands to benefit from the industries shaping the future - AI, the metaverse, virtual reality, and automation - to name a few its Nvidia. This is no secret and many investors are already betting on the company for that reason.Analysts are looking for revenue to be flat over the next yeast, and then to double by January 2028. That requires annual growth of 15 to 20%. Whether industry growth can accommodate that is the 390 billion dollar question.According to all the valuation metrics that Simply Wall Street tracks , Nvidia appears moderately overvalued at the current price. However, that may not be the case if the company can deliver revenue growth above 20% for the next few years.Story continuesAlibaba - Analysts have been Behind the Curve on this oneShares of Alibaba ( NYSE: BABA ) traded higher after the company reported mixed second-quarter results. EPS was better than expected while revenue was slightly lower than consensus estimates. This seemed to be another case of a company beating very low expectations, and the fact remains that revenue is down 6% from a year ago and margins continue to contract.Our take: Alibaba is widely considered as ‘cheap’, and investors point to  Charlie Munger’s purchase at twice the current price as proof of this. Over time his investment may indeed pay off, but it’s worth noting that analyst estimates have continued to decline and have continuously been behind the curve since January last year.The shaded area in the chart below is the range of estimates for EPS and shows that the gap between forecasts and actual EPS has continued to widen. So while analysts are forecasting an imminent recovery in earnings, their track record is not great.You can keep track of this on our Alibaba analysis page . Another factor to keep eye on is institutional ownership . Foreign institutions have reduced their ownership of Alibaba substantially over the last 12 months - but it would be a positive development if this trend reversed.Palo Alto's Cash Flows are Looking GreatPalo Alto Networks ( Nasdaq: PANW ) released another set of strong results last week which resulted in the stock price bouncing 7%. This is actually the third time the stock has gapped higher on earnings, but the sector has remained out of favor for most of this year.In September Palo Alto split its stock 3 for 1 and we wondered if it would lead to more ownership amongst retail investors.  Since then the sector has been out of favor, but the percentage of shares held by retail investors did rise modestly from 10% to 12.8%.Our take:  While the cybersecurity sector is still out of favor, Palo Alto has continued to outperform its peers. One of the reasons for this appears to be the fact that it is more profitable, despite slightly slower growth. We covered this in more depth earlier in the year.This quarter represented the company’s second quarter of positive net income, but it's even more profitable when we look at the free cash flowPalo Alto Networks is more profitable than it appears. The chart illustrates the point: while the net income margin for the last 12 months was -2.45%, the cash flow margin was 41%. This is well ahead of most of Palo Alto's peers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

231,bd5af654-a8b6-3992-ae2c-3da58b8a9cdc,NVDA,2022-11-22,Will ETFs Win During Thanksgiving Week Amid Recessionary Fears?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etfs-win-during-thanksgiving-week-180006506.html,1669053606,STORY,"['NVDA', '^GSPC']","[Wall Street remains typically upbeat in Thanksgiving week, marking the start of a year-end Santa rally. “The last five trading days of November are traditionally positive, since 1950,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “There’s a two-thirds likelihood the market is up on the day before Thanksgiving and a 57% likelihood the day after Thanksgiving, and a 71% likelihood that it’s up on Monday,” as quoted on CNBC.However, this year is a little different given the sky-high inflation, the resultant rate hikes and recessionary fears. Wall Street was downbeat last week. Each of the key equity gadgets — the S&amp;P 500 (down 0.7%), the Dow Jones (down 0.01%), the Nasdaq Composite (down 1.6%) and the Russell 2000 (down 1.8%) — lost last week. Rising rate worries and recessionary fears were the key concerns. This raised doubts over the possibility of a successful thanksgiving week this year.Can Wall Street Remain Positive This Thanksgiving?Minutes from the FOMC's latest meeting, the Federal Reserve committee which votes on monetary policy, are likely to show officials planning a half-point rate hike at their December meeting. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic was the latest Fed member to reinforce this likelihood.He said that he was comfortable to retreat from 75-basis-point increases at the next meeting but declared that rates may reach 4.75%-5% before the Fed is done with its current tightening cycle. “If the economy proceeds as I expect, I believe that 75 to 100 basis points of additional tightening will be warranted,” Bostic said. This is a kind of “mixed bag” news as this means rates will go up from here at a relatively moderate rate.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in at favorable. CPI rose at a 7.7% clip last month, down from 8.2% in September. Though recessionary concerns are rife, of S&amp;P 500 companies that conducted earnings calls from September 15 to November 16, 26% fewer companies mentioned the term “recession,” — 179 cited the word, down from 242 in the last quarter's earnings period, per FactSet data, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Story continuesAgainst this backdrop, we highlight a few ETFs for Thanksgiving week. These ETFs have higher chances of gaining in the week.ETFs in FocusIndustrial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLI – Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Industrial activities have been in decent shape. Growing employment in manufacturing sector calls for that strength. The sector is expected to witness revenue growth of 12.9% in Q3 revenues, after 10.8% growth in Q2 (read: 5 Sector ETFs to Play for Revenue Growth Potential).iShares U.S. Utilities ETF IDU – Zacks Rank #2The utilities sector has come up with mostly decent results this earnings season. More than half of S&amp;P 500 companies beat on bottom line while most of the companies surpassed the top-line estimates. Being a low-beta sector, utility is relatively protected from large swings (ups and downs) in the stock market and is thus considered a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil.AXS 1.25X NVDA Bear Daily ETF NVDSNvidia has gained a lot in recent times, but may not continue this run. “It’s the worst of all worlds, because the rate of revenue growth is declining, macro fundamentals are deteriorating, and the valuation is still exceptionally high,” said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management, per Bloomberg. Abate owns Nvidia but has been cutting his position in the stock.Nvidia disappointed investors with its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it missed earnings estimates and forecast weakness in revenues for the ongoing quarter.

The problem is that only a handful of countries, including the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, a few EU countries, and increasingly, China – have the specialised knowledge and capital-intensive capacity needed to produce them.For this reason, supply chains are subject to security risks and trade wars, turning semiconductors into a true geopolitical thorn.Cirrus Logic, Inc - Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) has a been assigned new patent for detecting wind noise incident on a single microphone to its already abundant intellectual portfolio.AXCELIS - Axcelis (NASDAQ: ACLS), a leading supplier of enabling ion implantation solutions for the semiconductor industry, just announced it became a founding member in the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC) of SEMI.WIseKey - Cybersecurity, IoT, and AI platform Swiss company WISeKey International Holding (NASDAQ: WKEY) who is currently working with the European Commission to help achieve the goals of the EU Chips Act just revealed its FY 2022 semiconductor revenue continued to surge. - WISeKey expects a transformative 2023 with record revenue growth over 40% as compared to FY 2022 due to new contracts to secure medical equipment, drones, routers, batteries, and smart meters - Its Semiconductor IoT segment that is located in South of France segment has returned to pre-COVID levels with FY 2022 revenue is expected to be approximately $22.7 million, marking a 34% increase.Intel Corp. - As part of its responsible AI commitment, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has productized FakeCatcher, a technology that can detect fake videos with 96% accuracy.- This is the world’s first real-time deepfake detector that returns results in milliseconds unlike detection apps that require uploading videos for analysis, then waiting hours for results.  - While most deep learning-based detectors try to identify what is wrong as they look for signs of inauthenticity. FakeCatcher looks for authentic clues that make us ‘human’ such as subtle “blood flow” signals in the pixels of a video that algorithms translate these signals into spatiotemporal maps. Using deep learning, it instantly detects whether a video is real or fake.   -This is of great significance to all those harmed by deception and its consequences, such as diminished trust.Story continuesNvidia Corp. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are building an AI super computer - It will be the first cloud computer that will integrate Microsoft's Azure cloud computing system with Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips, its Quantum-2 InfiniBand network and Nvidia AI Enterprise software.   - The AI supercomputer will harness Microsoft's virtual machines so they can handle more complex research and perform automated functions.   - Azure will help Nvidia develop advanced generative AI that provides machines with the ability to create new content.   - Nvidia’s latest earnings show its revenue fell 17 percent as PC market and gaming are slowing down after the pandemic boom, but data center remains its bright spot as growth remained strong.   - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that  the company is “adapting to the macro environment”.   All in all, chip wars have just began as a whole new world is being formed.See more from BenzingaAnother Day, Another Step Into the Digital Future - Briefing Up Wallstreet Today -Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Total debt (short and long-term) at the end of the second quarter of 2022 was $792.4 million compared with $792.2 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022.The cumulative net cash flow used in operating activities at the end of the third quarter of 2022 was $106.7 million compared with $98.1 million in the year-ago period.Story continuesGuidanceSmileDirectClub narrowed its guidance for 2022.The company narrowed total revenue guidance in the range of $470-$500 million (from the earlier projection of $450-$500 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $484.1 million.Gross margin (as a percentage of total revenues) is expected in the range of 70.5-71.5% ( from 69.5-71.5% guided earlier) for the full-year 2022.Our TakeSmileDirectClub exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, the company registered a year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter due to lower unique aligner shipments. The company also witnessed a drop in net and financing revenues on a year-over-year basis. The contraction of gross margin does not bode well. Escalating operating costs are exerting pressure on the bottom line.Throughout the third quarter, the macroeconomic challenges continued to impact SmileDirectClub’s core demographic and business spending. According to the company, challenges to consumer spending and sustained high inflation continue to impact its overall expected demand for the rest of the year.On a positive note, a series of cutting-edge innovations, strategic distribution and insurance partnerships are added positives. The company’s continued investments to influence consumer decision-making and penetrate new demographics also seem strategic.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksSmileDirectClub currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK, all carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

(NYSE:APD)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-air-products-120258706.html,1669118578,STORY,['APD'],"[Let's talk about the popular Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD). The company's shares led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Air Products and Chemicals’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals What Is Air Products and Chemicals Worth?Air Products and Chemicals is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 29.3x is currently well-above the industry average of 15.04x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Furthermore, Air Products and Chemicals’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach levels around its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What does the future of Air Products and Chemicals look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Air Products and Chemicals' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 40%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in APD’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe APD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on APD for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for APD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

The company has also outperformed its industry’s rise of 5.3% over the same time frame. It has also topped the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 6.2% decline over the same period.Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What’s Favoring the Stock?Better-than-expected earnings performance in the fiscal fourth quarter and upbeat outlook for fiscal 2023 have contributed to the gain in the company's shares. Air Products’ adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share for fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77. Revenues climbed around 26% year over year to $3,570 million, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,279.7 million.The industrial gases giant gained from increased pricing, higher volumes and higher energy cost pass-through in the quarter. Volumes were driven by new plants, recovery in hydrogen and improved merchant demand. The company witnessed improved pricing in the three largest regional segments.Air Products, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $11.20-$11.50, indicating a 9-12% year-over-year growth. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.60 -$2.80, suggesting a rise of 5-13% from the year-ago quarter.Air Products is benefiting from investments in high-return projects, new business deals, acquisitions and productivity initiatives. It remains committed to its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects. These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flows. The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2027) around $36.5 billion in high-return investments aimed at creating significant shareholder value. It has already spent or committed roughly 73% of the capacity.The company is also boosting productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead. Air Products also has been benefiting from higher pricing. Higher merchant demand is also driving its volumes.Air Products also remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong balance sheet and cash flows. The company, earlier this year, increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.62 per share from $1.50 per share. This marked the 40th straight year of dividend increase. The company expects to pay more than $1.4 billion of dividend to shareholders in calendar 2022.Story continues Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and Consensus Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

243,3d1db158-927b-3314-aff5-3f21db753c49,GPC,2022-11-22,Genuine Parts (GPC) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-gpc-incredible-growth-174505142.html,1669052705,STORY,['GPC'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Genuine Parts (GPC) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this auto and industrial parts distributor is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Genuine Parts is 9.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -1%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Genuine Parts has an S/TA ratio of 1.35, which means that the company gets $1.35 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 1.06, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Genuine Parts is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 15.9% this year versus the industry average of 10.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

Its subscriptions and total hours watched grew 45% and 70% year over year, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2023, making it FOX Nation’s highest quarter ever for hours watched. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.It released original content like Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back and Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner to expand its existing library and now awaits the release of Christmas at The Greenbrier, the second feature film from Fox News’ subscription streaming platform, which will premiere on Nov 24.Story continues Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteBesides this, Fox Business is also benefiting from a growing user base, as it achieved 142 million multiplatform views, delivered over 261 million multiplatform minutes, up 3% year-over-year, and had 19 million multiplatform unique visitors.This let Fox Business surpass Warner Bros Discovery’s WBD CNN Business for seven consecutive months. The latter’s launch of the streaming service CNN+ accounted for a huge loss for the company and was shut down a few months back. Management is still hunting for new sources of revenue.HeadwindsDespite a strong pipeline of content, Fox is suffering from a shift in consumer behavior. Consumers are opting for subscription video-on-demand and advertising-based video-on-demand from multichannel video programming distributors, which Fox is currently using to deliver broadcast and cable networks to consumers.The cable business faces a serious threat from OTT platforms like Netflix NFLX due to cord-cutting, which does not bode well for Fox. Netflix is set to launch its ad-tier subscription for customers by the end of this year. This low-cost subscription is expected to gain traction and the streaming giant currently expects to gain one million paid subscribers in the third quarter of 2022.Fox recently announced the merger with News Corporation NWSA, which not has boded well with the investors. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.Shares of Fox Corporation, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have declined 20.2% year to date compared to the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.6%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Trump made the announcement Tuesday night, saying he wants to give Republicans a fighting chance in the next election. This comes after the Democrats made significant gains in the midterm elections. Consequently, ‘Trump stocks’ are likely to gain big in line with how Trump fares in the political arena over the next couple of years.Politics has taken a beat seat for Wall Street in 2022, with the macroeconomic forces acting as key market drivers. However, with Trump’s smashing entry into the 2024 presidential race, a fair few Trump-linked stocks stand to gain immensely over the next couple of years.

In fact, the company has been linked to being a conservative media outlet for years, and it looks like those ties will only strengthen in the coming years. Trump has always had a strong relationship with Fox News, and the news outlet has often been one of his strongest supporters. So, it’s no surprise that Trump’s 2024 run will be good for Fox Corp. Trump’s candidacy will bring more attention to the network and its affiliates – which can only mean more viewers and higher ratings.From a fundamentals perspective, the media giant has consistently delivered healthy revenue and earnings growth each year. Advertising revenues have been driven by higher political advertising, an area that should demonstrate continued strength for the foreseeable future. Moreover, its stock trades at just 1.2 times trailing-twelve-month sales, roughly 25% lower than its 5-year average.Story continuesBlack Rifle Coffee Company (BRCC)Exterior of Black Rifle Coffee Company Store. BRCC stock.Source: YuniqueB / ShutterstockBlack Rifle Coffee Company (NYSE:BRCC) is a strong brand in the coffee market. BRCC’s competitive strengths come from quality products, effective media platforms, a scalable omnichannel strategy, and a loyal customer base. Hence, it’s in a strong position to compete in the massive $85 billion U.S. coffee industry. The company’s focus on quality and branding has helped it to become a leader in the premium coffee segment. In addition, BRCC’s media platform provides the company with a powerful tool for promoting its brand and connecting with customers.The veteran-founded coffee business went public via a shell company and has often been linked to the conservative party. It has received positive mentions from several popular names in the Republican Party, including Donald Trump Jr., who appeared on BRCC’s podcast. With its conservative slant and a focus on veterans from the armed forces, the firm is likely to deliver long-term gains ahead.Rumble (RUM)Illustrative Editorial of RUMBLE.COM website homepage.

Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.61,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-worldwide-nasdaq-100845409.html,1669111725,STORY,['CHRW'],"[C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) will increase its dividend on the 3rd of January to $0.61, which is 11% higher than last year's payment from the same period of $0.55. This takes the annual payment to 2.3% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. View our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide C.H. Robinson Worldwide's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before making this announcement, C.H. Robinson Worldwide was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 22.7% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 33%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendC.H. Robinson Worldwide Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.32 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.20. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.2% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. C.H. Robinson Worldwide has impressed us by growing EPS at 22% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.C.H. Robinson Worldwide Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about.

The decision was largely cheered by Wall Street, with Disney's stock gaining more than 6% on Monday to cut its loss to 37% for the year to date.The move is effective immediately.During his first tenure from 2005 to 2020, Disney's annualised shareholder returns were more than 14%, well above its rival Comcast Corp and the broader stock market, and in total in that period the stock rose more than 400%.Yet analysts and some investors say that a returning CEO repeating their past success is not a given, and the decision to once again hand them the reins may be a sign that a company's culture is sputtering.""From a governance perspective it's a big red flag,"" said Brian Frank, whose Frank Funds has owned Disney on and off in the past and currently does not have a position in the company, viewing its valuation as too high. ""This is one of the highest- quality companies in the world with the best brands in the world but it shows to me that they're bad at succession planning.""Disney did not return a request for comment for this story.GAME-CHANGER OR DUD?Overall, the stock performance of companies led by CEOs who returned for another stint in their former position - so-called boomerang CEOs - was 10.1% lower during their tenures than companies led by chief executives who had not had the job before, according to a 2020 study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review by Christopher Bingham, Bradley Hendricks, Travis Howell, and Kalin Kolev.Chief among the factors for the poor performance of repeat CEOs were if the executive was a company founder, if they worked in a dynamic or fast-changing industry, and if the company had neglected succession planning, the study found.Story continuesShares of Xerox fell 60% in the year after Paul Allaire returned as CEO in 2000 as the company was unable to adapt to new digital technologies, the study found. Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble Co, meanwhile, rose about 3% during A.G. Lafley's two-year second stint as CEO, while the broad S&amp;P 500 index rose about 26% over the same time.Xerox declined comment and P&amp;G did not respond to a request for comment.Yet there are reasons to think that Disney may have made the right decision in bringing back Iger, Bingham said.""There might be more reason for optimism relative to some of these other boomerang CEOs as Iger was not the founder, was not gone for too long, and is coming back in with a plan to help succession,"" he said in an email to Reuters.Apple Inc's Steve Jobs is perhaps the best-case scenario of a chief executive returning to their previous company. Jobs famously resumed his position as CEO in 1997 when Apple was near collapse and remade it into the world's most valued company by the time he stepped down again in 2011.Howard Schultz, who built the Starbucks Corp franchise, was also successful in his second stint. Shares rose more than 1,000% in his tenure between 2008 and 2017.Starbucks did not comment on this story, but directed Reuters to its earnings results that topped expectations after Schultz’s third term as CEO.“I think this is a game-changer,"" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, about Disney. Link has owned the stock in the past and is bullish on the name. ""This reminds me very much of Starbucks 2.0 or 3.0 with Howard Schultz returning to Starbucks,” Link said. “I think the only thing [Iger] is not great at is finding a successor.”While Wall Street is cheering Iger's return, Disney's long-term success will rest on whether he can successfully turn the company's streaming business profitable while managing the decline of its traditional television business and a likely slowdown in its parks division if the economy falls into a recession, said David Heger, an analyst at Edward Jones.""Iger may have dodged a bullet because the time period when Chapek was CEO was not ideal with the pandemic shutdown of the parks and the shutdown of movie production,"" Heger said. ""But it's not an enviable position to come back in to because there are so many different challenges across the business and industry.""(Reporting by David Randall in New YorkEditing by Megan Davies and Matthew Lewis)]"

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Edge Computing Companies in the World. The boom in big data has enabled companies and governments to have massive amounts of data at their disposal. This has opened up new technological avenues for data analysis, mainly cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. A relatively newer form of big data analysis and computing is edge computing. This seeks to bypass the hassles of transferring data all the way from the consumer (or source) to the cloud, and instead, it looks to bring computing closer to the consumer instead.Due to this, the edge computing industry is one of the largest emerging sectors in technology. A research report from Research and Markets estimates that the industry will be worth $155 billion by 2030, after it grows at a remarkable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.9%. The research firm believes that the integration of artificial intelligence into cloud computing will help drive this growth, with industries such as machine control and telecommunications taking charge. For the latter, telecommunication firms will seek to place their computing centers close to their data centers, a development that will further be aided by the growth in fifth generation (5G) communications technology.Another report, this time from Transparency Market Research, estimates that the global edge computing market was worth $6.95 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a 37.3% CAGR and sit at $161 billion by the end of the forecast period, mirroring the conclusions reached by Research and Markets. Transparency Market Research believes that the internet of things (IoT) industry will aid this growth, with connected devices providing more data and requiring the need to place the computing centers closer to the end user.Today's list will focus on some of the top edge computing companies in the world, and it covers hardware, software, and infrastructure providers.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So while Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Colgate-Palmolive:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 31%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceIn the above chart we have measured Colgate-Palmolive's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Colgate-Palmolive.So How Is Colgate-Palmolive's ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Colgate-Palmolive doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 44% where it was five years ago. However it looks like Colgate-Palmolive might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 20% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Colgate-Palmolive, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Comcast, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Comcast. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Comcast's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Comcast. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 9.2% and 7.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Brian Roberts, the CEO has 0.8% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of ComcastThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Comcast Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.3b of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Comcast , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is United Rentals (URI). URI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.70, which compares to its industry's average of 11.89.

Over the past 52 weeks, URI's P/CF has been as high as 8.82 and as low as 4.44, with a median of 6.08.These are only a few of the key metrics included in United Rentals's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Edge Computing Companies in the World. The boom in big data has enabled companies and governments to have massive amounts of data at their disposal. This has opened up new technological avenues for data analysis, mainly cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. A relatively newer form of big data analysis and computing is edge computing. This seeks to bypass the hassles of transferring data all the way from the consumer (or source) to the cloud, and instead, it looks to bring computing closer to the consumer instead.Due to this, the edge computing industry is one of the largest emerging sectors in technology. A research report from Research and Markets estimates that the industry will be worth $155 billion by 2030, after it grows at a remarkable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.9%. The research firm believes that the integration of artificial intelligence into cloud computing will help drive this growth, with industries such as machine control and telecommunications taking charge. For the latter, telecommunication firms will seek to place their computing centers close to their data centers, a development that will further be aided by the growth in fifth generation (5G) communications technology.Another report, this time from Transparency Market Research, estimates that the global edge computing market was worth $6.95 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a 37.3% CAGR and sit at $161 billion by the end of the forecast period, mirroring the conclusions reached by Research and Markets. Transparency Market Research believes that the internet of things (IoT) industry will aid this growth, with connected devices providing more data and requiring the need to place the computing centers closer to the end user.Today's list will focus on some of the top edge computing companies in the world, and it covers hardware, software, and infrastructure providers.

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 32%. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 20%. Longer term investors have fared much better, since the share price is up 20% in three years. On top of that, the share price is down 7.5% in the last week.After losing 7.5% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Micron Technology share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 50%. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.Given the yield is quite low, at 0.8%, we doubt the dividend can shed much light on the share price. Micron Technology's revenue is actually up 11% over the last year. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthMicron Technology is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsStory continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 20% in the twelve months, Micron Technology shareholders did even worse, losing 31% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 4% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Although Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) did well during the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting chip supply shortages, it has faced a drop in demand since then, and its lack of agility has been revealed to investors.The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the semiconductor industry. The shortage of raw materials and skilled labor, higher freight costs and delayed deliveries have all taken their toll. However, there has been one silver lining: the increased demand for smartphones, TVs and other electronic devices has helped to sustain the industry. The increased demand for microchips has allowed the industry to weather the storm well.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MU. Click here to check it out. MU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MUPeter Lynch Chart of MUHowever, growth is slowing down due to macroeconomic factors and a supply glut as supply chain issues begin resolving. Micron is among those companies that are feeling the squeeze. The company faces challenges on many fronts, including lower product demand and increased competition from rivals. As a result, Micron's stock price has dropped sharply in recent months.Micron Technology Will Take a Few Quarters to RecoverDespite these challenges, Micron remains a leader in the semiconductor industry, and its products are in high demand. However, it remains to be seen how well the company can weather the current storm.Micron is facing cyclical changesMicron Technology is facing several challenges that will likely weigh on the company in the near term. Firstly, demand for personal computers has declined over the years as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. This has led to weaker-than-expected demand for Micron's main product, DRAM chips. Secondly, the company is also facing headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar, which has made its products more expensive in overseas markets and decreased the value of international sales. Lastly, Micron is currently transitioning to newer technologies, which has led to higher research and development costs.Story continuesUnlike competitors, Micron focuses solely on memory chips and does not venture into the logical chips market. The company mainly derives revenues from its DRAM and NAND memory chips, which account for over 90% of its revenue. The singular focus has advantages, but Micron takes a big hit every time the demand for memory chips lowers.Currently, the market has an overflow of memory chips; it will take at least another quarter for the supply and demand to match. In other words, Micron is facing a supply glut. A supply chain crisis triggered by the global pandemic led to governments honing in on the chip shortage. This emergency-driven government investment resulted in an overshot.Recent earningsMicron's struggles came to light when it reported earnings recently. The company posted a 20% decline in its fiscal fourth quarter revenue to $6.6 billion, mainly due to rapidly weakening consumer demand. The annual revenue, though, jumped 11% to $30.8 billion. Most major business units saw a double-digit decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter.On the bright side, the company posted a $1.6 billion profit during the fourth quarter. The company also declared an 11.5 cents per share dividend and bought back shares worth $784 million during the quarter.In response to weakening demand, Micron has decided to cut its wafer starts by 20% to address the excessive production and avoid a price war in the industry. The chipmaker also plans on cutting its capital expenditures during the current quarter. Investors take this as a sign of weakness, which is why the announcements have sent the stock downward.Micron is playing the US-China trade tensions to its advantageOn a brighter note, Micron has opportunities to benefit from the U.S.-China trade tensions. The company plans to invest in building new plants in the U.S. due to governement financial incentives. There will be an element of risk associated with this course of action; after all, there are plenty of well-documented reasons as to why manufacturers moved out of the U.S. to begin with, first and foremost being the fact that the labor is expensive. However, Micron's pivot toward the American market could help protect it from future geopolitical tensions.The U.S. sanctions on China to reduce sales of semiconductor technology and manufacturing machinery to the country will have a two-way effect. It's like shooting your opponent in the foot, but in return you have to also shoot yourself in the foot. The long term impact of these actions is yet to be seen, but I believe Micron may benefit from this in the short term. China's YMTC is one of its main competitors, and its business will be negatively affected by U.S. sanctions. YMTC acquires materials worth up to $2.5 billion annually from Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), a semiconductor technology provider. Thus, YMTC is among the dozens of companies that will be directly affected by sanctions, as it will no longer be able to buy its manufacturing equipment from Lam, giving Micron a leg up.Micron plans to invest a total of $100 billion in a plant in New York over the next 20 years. It will create about 50,000 new jobs and help boost the local supply of semiconductors. The company also plans to invest $15 billion through the decade's end in a facility in Boise, Idaho. The moves come soon after the U.S. government passed the CHIPS and Science Act, which will see $50 billion spent on revitalizing local semiconductor production.TakeawayThe bottom line is that Micron is in trouble in the near term. It is expected to take a financial beating in the next few quarters due to excess inventory and a lack of sales momentum. Micron needs to find a way to sell its chips at a lower price, or it needs to find a way to increase its sales momentum. Lowering the price means compromising on margins. But that might be what it needs to do to combat the supply glut.However, Micron's problems are not unique, and many other companies face similar issues. Micron's stock price reflects the headwinds it is facing at this time, and the stock is down close to 40% this year. In the long term, it can likely recover, but a lot hinges on whether semiconductor manufacturing can be successfully and efficiently brought back to the U.S.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(MU): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-micron-technology-140002196.html,1669039202,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +4.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.8% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 11.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post earnings of $0.03 per share, indicating a change of -98.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -17.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $0.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -99.3%. This estimate has changed -62% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.13 indicates a change of +5,128.8% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -44.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $18.77 billion and $25.44 billion estimates indicate -39% and +35.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $6.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.7%. EPS of $1.45 for the same period compares with $2.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.03%. The EPS surprise was +3.57%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS) was double downgraded by Bank of America to Underperform from Buy with a price target of $42, down from the prior $72, as a result of the firm’s deep dive on the company’s business “Magic: The Gathering.” The trading card game generates about 15% of Hasbro’s total revenue and as much as 35% of EBITDA. The analyst said, ""The primary concern is that Hasbro has been overproducing Magic cards which has propped up Hasbro’s recent results but is destroying the long-term value of the brand.""2. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) was downgraded by Bank of America to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $50, down from the prior $77. The analyst said the recent crash of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has yielded “a number of new headwinds over the near/medium-term” for Coinbase. Separately, Mizuho reiterated a Neutral rating on Coinbase as daily industry volumes are back to trending 30-40% below YTD averages, which suggests “worn-out consumers who appear uninterested in the category.”3. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) (ETR:SAPG) was downgraded by Jefferies to Underperform from Outperform with a price target of €90 ($92.17) from the prior €117.79. The analyst said, ""We believe the new (more conservative) CFO will fail to deliver on promised upgrades"" and reflected negatively on the valuation of SAP stock, which he said remains “amongst the most expensive in the sector.”4.

HP (NYSE:HPQ) was downgraded by Credit Suisse to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $33, down from the prior $29.29.

Alcon (NYSE:ALC) was downgraded by Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) to Hold from Sell with a price target of CHF60.20 ($62.85).7. Dominion Resources (NYSE:D) was downgraded by Evercore ISI to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $78. The analyst said, ""We are downgrading Dominion from Outperform to In Line following the business review announced with Q3 release on Nov 4th.""8. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) was double downgraded by Credit Suisse to Underperform from Outperform with a price target of $14, down from the prior $20. While the analyst describes NCLH as a “quality” company, they see risk to estimates and valuation after the company “materially outperformed” year-to-date (YTD). Norwegian Cruise Line stock is down about 15% YTD, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.9. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) was downgraded by Deutsche Bank to Hold from Buy with a price target of $144, down from the prior $183. The analyst said, ""We have lower confidence that the company can meaningfully recapture margin in 2023 on lingering markdown pressure, particularly in light of comp growth coming under pressure.""10. Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR (NYSE:TEVA) was downgraded by JPMorgan to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $10, down from the prior $11.

In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$2.7m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Aon The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AonOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Eric Andersen, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$283 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$302). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 5.7% of Eric Andersen's holding.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.3m for 4.60k shares. But they sold 9.65k shares for US$2.7m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Aon shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Aon Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Aon. Specifically, insider Byron Spruell bought US$117k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This makes one think the business has some good points.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Aon insiders own 1.1% of the company, worth about US$714m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Aon Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchase is heartening. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The high levels of insider ownership, and the recent buying by an insider suggests they are well aligned and optimistic. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Aon.

You can live without a new house. Even the latest Hollywood thriller isn’t something that’s absolutely necessary. However, you can’t live without food – and that’s what makes food stocks a key investing priority of long-term conservative types.Food companies are the ultimate value stocks, given that they’re consistently profitable. When times are good, food stocks consolidate and create value with brand extensions. In times of inflation, these companies keep margins high by making smaller packages for the same price. Indeed, even in times of recession, investors clamor to hold food stocks, given the essential products they provide to a clientele that’s still buying, even when they’re cutting back everywhere else.Not all food stocks are great investments. This year, various protein players in the market like animal protein company Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and plant-based protein company Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), have been losing investments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat said, food stocks that operate in grain-based segments of the market appear to be handling inflation the best. Despite the price of wheat surging from around $8/bushel in 2022 to much higher levels flowing the the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the willingness to pay of consumers among grain-based foods appears to remain high.Thus, whether we’re talking about cookings, chips, or bread, consumers want it, and are willing to pay up. Indeed, I think 2023 could be set up as a year for staples. Accordingly, here are three companies worth considering right now.GISGeneral Mills$79.77KKellogg’s$70.03PEPPepsico$180.03KHCKraft Heinz$37.75MCDMcDonald’s$273.36General Mills (GIS)General Mills Cereal, GIS stockSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comFirst on my list of top food stocks to buy is giant General Mills (NYSE:GIS). From a performance standpoint, it makes sense to start here. That’s because the stock is up about 16% this year. Recently, General Mills increased its dividend 6% to $2.16 per year, reflecting a yield of 2.8%. It currently has a price to earnings multiple of 16.5-times.Story continuesGeneral Mills’ success comes from processing grains and milk into highly-profitable products. Famously, the company makes brands such as Old El Paso Mexican food and Totino’s pizza, Yoplait yogurt and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. General Mills also makes Blue Buffalo dog food, Epic protein bars, Bold Cultr milk-free cheese and Annie’s macaroni and cheese.That’s a long list to be sure. But the business is relatively simple, starting with milling grain into cereal and flour. However, turning a commodity into something consumers want isn’t easy. Accordingly, the company’s CEO has long said General Mills’ brands must “stand for something.” That’s because the company is in a constant fight against generics and store brands.Analysts seem to like the company’s business model, with Jefferies analysts projecting GIS to turn in earnings of $1.14 per share next quarter. Similarly, other analysts have been raising their price targets.The key reason to own GIS stock is its defensive posture and diversified portfolio of brands. This is a slow-growing company, but in a slow-growth economy, that could be just what investors need.Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIn 2022 Kellogg (NYSE:K) lost patience with breakfast cereal. I think what’s turned out to be a dramatic shift for the company could result in faster growth ahead.The company announced in June it will spin-off its North American cereal business. This massive segment provided sales of $2.4 billion, making its cereal business a significant company in its own right. Overall, the company plans to separate into three independent companies, in a bid to accelerate growth.The pre-split company, with sales of $14.2 billion in 2021, is now worth $23.9 billion, up about 5% on the year. That translates to a price to earnings ratio of around 16-times, with a dividend yielding 3.4%. If the break-up works as intended, it should yield faster growth for the main company and two attractive buy-out candidates for investors.Tomorrow’s Kellogg will be a global snacking business, using some of the cereals’ branding. North America will represent half the new Kellogg’s sales. The division represents 80% of total sales.Since the split was announced, Kellogg stock has traded sideways. That’s because investors and analysts gave a thumbs-down to Kellogg’s third quarter numbers, which showed almost no growth. Operating cash flow during the quarter, however, rose to $1.18 billion.Pepsico (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsico (NYSE:PEP) is best known for soda. But it’s also the biggest food processor in the U.S. On a global scale, it’s number two, behind only Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY).Most of Pepsi’s food sales come from the acquisitions of Frito-Lay in 1965 and Quaker Oats in 2000. When Pepsi bought Quaker Oats, it was assumed drinks like Gatorade would be the star. But Quaker also makes snack bars and cookies.The company wins by being constantly ready to innovate. This year, Pepsi announced it will introduce Ghost Kitchens to help its partners deliver hot food to consumers based on its brands. It’s replacing diesel with cooking oil in some of its delivery trucks. Further, the company is investing directly in global agriculture, and is quietly moving into alcohol.In its third quarter report, Pepsi’s net income grew to 8.8% year-over-year, coming in at $2.7 billion or $1.95 per share.  These earnings came on revenue of $21.97 billion. Analysts worried that food sales fell 1.5% but most still have a buy rating on the stock.Pepsi is often compared to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), but the two companies are very different. Coke remains committed to beverages, recently adding coffee and sports drinks brands to its portfolio. Pepsi remains tied to food, linking with Beyond Meat last year. The two debuted a plant-based beef jerky in May.Pepsico is a steady performer, providing welcome diversification in any portfolio that may get bloated with technology and other fast-growth stocks. Pepsi shares are up 57% in the last 5 years, and are even up this year. The company’s dividend, now yielding 2.6%, is also always welcome by long-term investors.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comMany laughed when Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) combined Heinz with Kraft Foods in 2015, under the leadership of Brazil’s 3G Capital, to create Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC).While some are still launching, and Kraft Heinz likely remains one of Buffett’s few mistakes, I think this is a stock worth considering. Shares of KHC stock are still down about 50% from where they were when the deal was done. However, Berkshire still has a 26% stake in the company, and under CEO Miguel Patricio, progress is finally being made. The stock held its own in 2022, with investors attracted by a dividend yielding 4.3%.For the September quarter, Kraft Heinz beat estimates with net income of $432 million, or 35 cents per share, on revenue of $6.5 billion. The company reaffirmed guidance of high single-digit growth. Net income was down, but the company cut its debt and future interest costs during the quarter.When Kraft was split up a decade ago, higher-margin products like Oreo cookies went to a new company, Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ). The assumption was that cookies would out-run things like Velveeta, Heinz ketchup and Oscar Meyer deli meats. Over the last five years, that’s been the case, with Mondelez up 53% and Kraft down a similar amount. An accounting scandal late in the last decade didn’t help.However, in 2022, this trend has reversed. Mondelez is down and Kraft Heinz is up, if only by a little bit. Patricio shed Planter’s nuts and the company’s natural cheese business, focusing instead on quirky marketing for traditional brands. Patricio insists the best is yet to come, and he’s seeking innovation with plant-based cheese. I agree, and think now is the time to get into KHC stock.McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comEver since former CEO Steve Easterbrook shifted the company’s strategy in 2015, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has been a winning investment. Shares of MCD stock have risen at twice the rate of the S&amp;P 500, and the company’s dividend is up 62% to $6.02 per year, yielding 2.2%.The key for these results appears to be the company’s supply chain, on which McDonald’s spends $14 billion per year. This includes private protein providers like Tyson, but also thousands of other, mainly privately-owned, food companies.Long-term, mutually-profitable relationships are what make McDonald’s the world’s largest food service operation. With over 38,000 locations in 100 countries, 93% of McDonald’s locations are operated as franchises.Easterbrook left after a sex scandal in 2019, but successor Chris Kempczinski continued in the same strategic direction. Thus, strong performance has been reflected in the company’s numbers. Last year, McDonald’s brought in margins of 32% on its whopping $23.2 billion in revenue. While the company’s market capitalization sits right around $200 billion, almost six times that of its nearest rival YUM! Brands (NYSE:YUM), I still think this is a stock with more upside from here.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in PEP.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Prologis'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Prologis How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, Prologis' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 6.9% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Prologis' decent 17% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Prologis' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 12% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PLD? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Prologis Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Prologis seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 51%, meaning the company retains only 49% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Besides, Prologis has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 58% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Prologis' future ROE will drop to 6.6% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Prologis' performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(NASDAQ:NWL) will pay a dividend of $0.23 on the 15th of December. This means the annual payment is 7.0% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Newell Brands' stock price has reduced by 37% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for Newell Brands Newell Brands' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Newell Brands' earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 48.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 47% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendNewell Brands Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.32, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Newell Brands May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. In the last five years, Newell Brands' earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 4.5% per annum. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Newell Brands (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing.

288,968a708a-03a2-3924-aa03-cdb7ee42a083,PCAR,2022-11-22,The Investment Case for Tesla (TSLA): Buy the Latest Dip?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investment-case-tesla-tsla-buy-150003980.html,1669042803,STORY,"['TSLA', 'PCAR', 'HOG']","[Tesla TSLA has been one of the most amazing growth stocks since its market debut in 2010, outperforming major tech titans and auto giants. While the electric vehicle (EV) bigwig had its share of ups and downs, it generated mind-boggling returns for patient investors.Indeed, its pricey valuation has never made sense but Tesla fans have always believed in Elon Musk’s vision. From a shaky startup, Tesla has come a long way on the back of its soaring popularity of e-mobility, exciting products, aggressive expansion efforts and legions of loyal fans. After running into losses for years, Tesla notched up its first full-year profit in 2020. Ever since, TSLA has managed to be in the black, proving its skeptics wrong.Over the last five years, shares of the company have skyrocketed more than 2,300%. But the stellar run on the bourses hit a pause this year, as is the case with many exciting and high-flying growth stocks. Logistical issues surfaced as a thorn in Tesla’s narrative. An ultra-hawkish Fed is further spoiling the momentum. Year to date, Tesla has plummeted roughly 50%, making even its most steady supporters jittery. On Friday, the stock sank to a 52-week low of $176.55, ending the session a tad higher at $180.19.Does the recent dip represent a buying opportunity? Before we look at Tesla’s outlook and valuation to see if it is indeed a good time to buy its shares, let’s check out what has been ailing the stock’s performance lately.Q3 Sales Miss, Twitter Hangover &amp; Other Pain PointsTesla reported third-quarter earnings last month, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same.Top-line growth was underwhelming, with sales missing expectations by 4% on revenues of $21.45 billion. A record 343,830 deliveries during the quarter slightly missed expectations as well. Shedding light on logistical challenges, management notified in a press release, “As our production volumes continue to grow, it is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost during these peak logistics weeks.” Of course, investors are discouraged by the sales miss and logistics concerns.Story continuesMarkets aren’t reacting too well to Musk’s takeover of Twitter. Tesla investors fear that Twitter could be a distraction for the entrepreneur. Musk’s selling of TSLA shares to fund Twitter is not going down well with its shareholders. Earlier this month, Musk liquidated more Tesla shares following his Twitter acquisition. He sold 19.5 million shares worth close to $4 billion, bringing the total value of Tesla shares sold by Musk to roughly $20 billion so far this year. A big concern of TSLA shareholders is that Musk will be spread too thin across all his responsibilities because of the Twitter takeover. Speculations are rife that the widely-hailed Tesla CEO doesn’t have enough time on his hands to navigate both companies properly.The stock was also hurt by the recent price cuts for its EVs in China. Tesla slashed the prices of Model 3/Y cars as much as 9% in China during late October amid signs of softening demand and rising competition in the world’s largest car market. Tesla is hardly immune to the supply-chain issues, and economic uncertainty and aggressive rate hikes are making matters worse for the automaker.Long-Term Prospects Still StrongThe world is doubling down on EV adoption with government subsidies, policy changes and infrastructure buildup. And Tesla has gradually established itself as a leader in the e-mobility space. This should be the perfect backdrop for solid growth into the foreseeable future. Tesla has a 5-year expected EPS growth rate of 31.4%, higher than the industry’s 18.7%.Robust demand for Models 3 and Y, production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin), and introduction of models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support delivery growth. Musk expects deliveries to surge at 30% annualized rate for the foreseeable future. It’s also worth noting that Tesla boasts an energy business with the potential to grow faster than its vehicles business. Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenues are on a massive growth trajectory, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products.Valuation &amp; Growth EstimatesDespite the massive sell-off this year, Tesla shares are still overvalued. TSLA has a P/E ratio of 34.95, above the industry average of 28.41. While the premium may be a factor, Tesla has never really been a value stock. Also, valuation is starting to become reasonable as the company is consistently improving its business model. Although expensive at 34.95X P/E, the value is the lowest level the shares have traded this year so far. TSLA’s P/S of 5.10 is also much lower than its decade-high 18.73 and near-the-median 4.06.While there could be better buying opportunities ahead, Tesla is trading at a far better valuation than it has in the past. Also, electric vehicles still represent a relatively small portion of the auto industry market and the space still has massive scope to grow.Year over year, TSLA’s 2022 EPS is now expected to rise 79.2% to $4.05. Earnings in 2023 are expected to jump another 30.5% to $5.29 per share. The top line is expected to climb 54% this year. Estimates point to another 39% ascent to $115.11 billion in 2023, more than quadrupling pre-pandemic sales of $24.57 billion registered in 2019.Final WordsAs Tesla's shares have slumped in the red year to date, long-term investors are therefore presented with an opportunity to buy the dips at a level not seen in some time. TSLA’s valuation multiples fell extensively, perhaps enticing investors with a long-term horizon. Further, Tesla has a strong growth profile, with revenue and earnings projected to soar by double-digit percentages in its current year and next. We believe, Tesla is a solid long-term investment option at current price levels based on its market leadership, progressively broadening global operations and new product developments that promise to take it to dizzy heights in the coming years.However, near-term headwinds persist. Tesla faces problems related to raw material procurement and the logistics. The strong U.S. dollar also doesn’t help a company that generates a significant percentage of sales overseas and a substantial ramp-up in production in the country. Commodity inflation has been shrinking the automotive gross margins of Tesla for the past two quarters. Persistent rate hikes and fears of a potential recession may create better opportunities, as the shares could get beaten down further. Considering all the tailwinds and headwinds, it would be a good idea to take a wait-and-see approach on Tesla.

(PCAR) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-inc-pcar-soars-52-141502682.html,1669040102,STORY,"['PCAR', 'HOG']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Paccar (PCAR)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $104.97 in the previous session. Paccar has gained 17.7% since the start of the year compared to the -41.2% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -48% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 25, 2022, Paccar reported EPS of $2.21 versus consensus estimate of $2.01 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.69%.For the current fiscal year, Paccar is expected to post earnings of $8.15 per share on $26.55 billion in revenues. This represents a 53.2% change in EPS on a 21.6% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.36 per share on $27.67 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 2.59% and 4.23%, respectively.Valuation MetricsPaccar may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Paccar has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 12.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 14.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 13.1X versus its peer group's average of 13X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Paccar fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Paccar shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does PCAR Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of PCAR have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is HarleyDavidson, Inc. (HOG). HOG has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of F.Earnings were strong last quarter. HarleyDavidson, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 22.76%, and for the current fiscal year, HOG is expected to post earnings of $4.74 per share on revenue of $4.88 billion.Shares of HarleyDavidson, Inc. have gained 32.5% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 10.1X and a P/CF of 7.97X.The Automotive - Domestic industry is in the top 50% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PCAR and HOG, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Joining me now is our very own Dani Romero, who got to hang out at a distribution center for UPS in Manhattan ahead of holiday. Sounds pretty cool.DANI ROMERO: Yeah. So 'tis the season for holiday shopping. But guess what? It's also the season for holiday shipping. So I got an inside look at one of the UPS centers here in Manhattan on how they're tackling this holiday season. Take a look. As customers click, companies like UPS ship.LEO CUMMINGS: It starts with the planning of the job prior to the actual unload, where the data that comes in from the shipping labels is sorted. The planners are then able to determine which vehicles will get which packages. And that sets up for the label application processes throughout the facility and allows for the package to flow through the facility in the right manner.DANI ROMERO: When you compare volume from last year to this year, what does that look like?LEO CUMMINGS: At this point, we're seeing a slight decrease. And we said that may happen due to the fact that there's not an inventory shortage of goods in the market.DANI ROMERO: Leo Cummings is the New York operations manager at this UPS center on West 43rd Street in Manhattan.LEO CUMMINGS: Well, I can tell you that all of the packages that come through this facility, 90% of the packages in our network go through some automated facility.DANI ROMERO: Here's how automation works at this location. Packages pass through machines like this that scans each parcel and spits out another label, giving workers a clear indication to where that package is going.LEO CUMMINGS: Well, automation here allows us to deskill certain handling opportunities for us. It allows us to make sure we're aware of where packages need to go in their final destination. It's a great tool for the entire building to use so we can identify where packages truly belong and get to the customer. Ultimately, we want to get to the point where the packages are going to the right vehicle so they can get to the right customer.Story continuesDANI ROMERO: Cummings says this has not reduced their number of workers inside the facility.LEO CUMMINGS: Automation allows you to take out the variables.DANI ROMERO: This facility processes more than 200,000 packages a day during this holiday season. At this site, they've already started to ramp up.LEO CUMMINGS: From the plan aspect, are we able to handle extra volume? Are we able to adjust when we have less volume? So we're ready for peak season.DANI ROMERO: Cummings says they will continue to hire more people.LEO CUMMINGS: There's a great opportunity for people. Last year alone, over 35,000 seasonal employees became permanent employees at UPS.DANI ROMERO: And those positions that you just heard, they range from $15 to $36 an hour. But Sozzi, there's also something else on the table for UPS. And that is one of the largest rail unions rejected a tentative deal.So that really, UPS is one of the largest rail customers. They sent us a statement that reads, ""We encourage an immediate resolution that is beneficial to all parties. And we believe that agreements can be reached. A rail strike would cause unnecessary impacts for the US economy and consumers. And UPS will flex our integrated smart logistics network to serve our customers."" So the stakes are really high here, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, Dani Romero, good reporting there.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fintech industry, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Fintech Companies In The World.The fintech industry is growing rapidly as more and more companies are using technology to create innovative financial products and services. Fintech companies are using technology to create new ways to save, invest, and borrow money. They are also using technology to create new ways to pay for goods and services. The fintech industry is changing the way people track their finances, and it is revolutionizing the financial services sector.An Analysis of The Global Fintech IndustryAccording to a report by The Brainy Insights, the global fintech market was worth $115 billion in 2021 and is on track to reach a value of $936.5 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 26.2% from 2022 to 2030. This growth is attributed to the improved infrastructure for making payments and for storing and accessing financial data. This includes factors such as better internet connectivity, improved mobile networks, and advancements in disruptive technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence.Another key driver is the growing investment from both venture capitalists and traditional financial institutions. This investment is helping to fuel the development of new products and services and is also helping to increase awareness of fintech among the general public. According to KPMG, global investments in fintech totaled $210 billion in 2021, up from $125 billion in 2020. The payments segment dominated the share of global fintech investments in 2021 and accounted for $51.7 billion. Investments in blockchain technology and crypto grew from $5.4 billion in 2020 to $30 billion in 2021.Key Trends in The Global Fintech IndustryThere are a few key trends in the fintech industry that are worth noting. First, there is a trend toward more collaboration between traditional financial institutions and fintech startups. This is happening as traditional financial institutions are starting to realize the potential of fintech to disrupt the status quo. They are also seeing the benefit of partnering with fintech companies to bring new products and services to market faster.Story continuesSecond, machine learning and artificial intelligence are being used more and more to help automate financial processes and make better decisions. This is a trend that is likely to continue as fintech companies look for ways to improve their products and services.Third, blockchain technology is starting to gain more traction in the fintech industry. This is because blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the way financial transactions are processed. Blockchain technology is secure, transparent, and efficient, and it has the potential to make a big impact on the financial industry.Finally, there is a trend toward more mobile-centric fintech products and services. This is because more and more people are using their mobile devices to manage their finances. Fintech companies are responding by creating more mobile-friendly products and services. According to EY Global's official Fintech Adoption Index, which is a comprehensive survey of 27,000 consumers across 27 key markers, global consumer adoption of fintech services was recorded at 64% in 2019. 33% of respondents reported that they prefer third-party services over financial institutions, 46% of respondents noted that they are comfortable sharing their bank account details with a third-party organization that provides fintech services, and 68% of respondents voted in favor of using a non-financial services company for financial services.This article will discuss in detail some of the biggest fintech companies in the world.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressThe Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$153. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, American Express insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At American Express Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at American Express. Specifically, insider Walter Clayton bought US$149k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This makes one think the business has some good points.Story continuesDoes American Express Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. American Express insiders own about US$131m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About American Express Insiders?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that American Express insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for American Express you should know about.Of course American Express may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(ARHS) and Tractor Supply (TSCO). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Arhaus, Inc. is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Tractor Supply has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ARHS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ARHS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.24, while TSCO has a forward P/E of 22.89. We also note that ARHS has a PEG ratio of 0.72. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TSCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.23.Another notable valuation metric for ARHS is its P/B ratio of 7.45. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSCO has a P/B of 12.51.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ARHS's Value grade of A and TSCO's Value grade of C.ARHS stands above TSCO thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ARHS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Remember, these are the SEC forms that the big money managers have to file 45 days after the end of the quarter which indicate what they have bought, or sold, during the prior quarter.We don't know when they bought or sold, or at what price, but we do know how big the position was and how many shares were sold.The Value Investor Podcast always checks in on Berkshire Hathaway's 13-F. In some quarters, Warren Buffett and his two lieutenants have done very little buying or selling. But with stocks selling off, and some deals out there in 2022, Berkshire has been more active.Q3 was no different.Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Shares or Buffett's Trades? Many value investors like to mimic the trades in Berkshire's portfolio.But in 2022, with value stocks back in favor, some investors are asking whether or not they shouldn't just buy Berkshire Hathaway's stock itself?Is it a deal?Berkshire Hathaway and its Portfolio: Values? 1.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Story continuesBerkshire Hathaway is more than just the stock portfolio and cash. It owns 62 companies including Dairy Queen, BNSF railroad, Duracell and Benjamin Moore, among others.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up 2.8% year-to-date which is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 which is down 17%. Over the last 5 years, it has also outperformed, gaining 70% versus the S&amp;P's gain of 54.8%.But I'm sorry to tell value fans that Berkshire Hathaway isn't a cheap stock. It trades with a forward P/E of 22.3. It also has a PEG ratio of 3.2. A PEG under 1.0 indicates value.Purely looking at Berkshire on a valuation basis, it probably shouldn't be on the short list.Is it worth the premium?2.       Taiwan Semiconductor TSMIn the third quarter, Berkshire added shares of Taiwan Semiconductor to the portfolio for the first time. It was a sizable position that puts it in as the 10th largest in the portfolio.Taiwan Semiconductor has an attractive P/E at 12.9. It also pays a dividend yielding 1.7%.Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are down 32% year-to-date but they've rallied 27% in the last month, after Berkshire had bought in.Did Buffett buy at the lows?3.       Louisiana-Pacific Corp. LPXLouisiana-Pacific, the buildings product company which makes items for the residential construction industry, was also added to Berkshire's portfolio for the first time in the third quarter. It's just a small position, of only 0.1% of the portfolio.Shares of Louisiana-Pacific have fallen 21% year-to-date. They're dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of just 5.2.But are they a trap? Louisiana-Pacific is expected to see earnings decline 12.2% this year and 57.7% next year.4.       Chevron Corp. CVXBuffett went all in on Chevron earlier in 2022 but Berkshire added another 2% to the position in the third quarter. Berkshire now owns 8.49% of the company.Shares of Chevron are up 57% year-to-date but they're still cheap, with a forward P/E of 9.8. In the third quarter, the shares had pulled back, so it's not surprising that Berkshire added to its position.Chevron pays a dividend of 3.1%.Should you be betting big on Chevron, even after the rally, as Buffett appears to be?5.       Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXYLike with Chevron, Berkshire started aggressively buying Occidental Petroleum earlier this year. But in the third quarter, it jumped in even further, establishing an $11.9 billion position. Berkshire now owns 20.74% of Occidental.Shares of Occidental Petroleum are up 146.7% year-to-date but remain cheap with a forward P/E of 7.5.Occidental has been paying down debt with some of its big free cash flow this year but it still pays a base dividend yielding 0.7%.Berkshire keeps diving into Occidental Petroleum.

We continued to leverage our operating efficiency and increasing scale to further improve our profitability profile, reporting a 15% operating profit margin in the third quarter.”Dr. Guo continued, “During the last two years, we have rebuilt our teams across the organization, bringing in some of the industry’s top talent. From research and development to legal, our teams are positively impacting our performance and being recognized for outstanding work with numerous industry awards such as the “Top 50 Emerging Chinese Consumption Brands with Strong Growth of the Year (2022)” by CBNData, and the “Top Chinese Brand 2022” from YiMagazine. I am exceptionally proud of the dedication from everyone at Luckin Coffee, as we continue to solidify our position as a world-class coffee brand. Furthermore, the release of our 2020-2022 corporate governance report showcased our determination to create both customer value and social value and laid a solid foundation for the long-term sustainable development of Luckin Coffee.”Dr. Guo concluded, “With our research and development capabilities and our operational efficiency, we are confident in our ability to continue capturing growth opportunities in the fast-growing China coffee market while driving long-term value and sustainable growth for our shareholders.”IMPACT OF COVID-19The global economy, the Chinese markets and the Company’s business have been and continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.With the gradual lifting of COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions since the second quarter of 2022, the Company experienced a downward trend in its temporary store closures for most of the third quarter of 2022. The Company had around 108 daily store closures on average in July and August 2022. However, as the winter season approached with bouts of COVID-19 cases in recent months, the Company experienced around 330 daily store closures on average in September and October 2022. As of the date of this earnings release, the number of daily store closures on average in November 2022 was around 500, and we believe this number may further increase for the months ahead.The COVID-19 situation remains highly unpredictable. The Company anticipates that its operations will continue to be negatively affected by pandemic-related market pressures for the foreseeable future. The extent of these impacts is difficult to predict given the uncertainties relating to the spread of the pandemic and its impacts on the local and national economies.THIRD QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTSTotal net revenues were RMB3,894.6 million (US$547.5 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 65.7% from RMB2,350.2 million in the same quarter of 2021. Net revenues growth was primarily driven by the increase in the number of products sold, the increase in stores in operation and the increase in the number of monthly transacting customers.Revenues from product sales were RMB2,995.5 million (US$421.1 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 54.9% from RMB1,934.1 million in the same quarter of 2021.Net revenues from freshly brewed drinks were RMB2,666.4 million (US$374.8 million), representing 68.4% of total net revenues in the third quarter of 2022, compared to RMB1,716.4 million, or 73.0% of total net revenues, in the same quarter of 2021.Net revenues from other products were RMB198.3 million (US$27.9 million), representing 5.1% of total net revenues in the third quarter of 2022, compared to RMB107.5 million, or 4.6% of total net revenues, in the same quarter of 2021.Net revenues from others were RMB130.9 million (US$18.4 million), representing 3.4% of total net revenues in the third quarter of 2022, compared to RMB110.2 million, or 4.7% of total net revenues, in the same quarter of 2021.Revenues from partnership stores were RMB899.1 million (US$126.4 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing 23.1% of total net revenues, which is an increase of 116.1% compared to RMB416.1 million, or 17.7% of total net revenues, in the same quarter of 2021. For the third quarter of 2022, revenues from partnership stores included sales of materials of RMB575.6 million (US$80.9 million), profit sharing of RMB144.8 million (US$20.4 million), sales of equipment of RMB66.3 million (US$9.3 million), delivery service of RMB106.4 million (US$15.0 million) and other services of RMB6.0 million (US$0.8 million).Total operating expenses were RMB3,309.4 million (US$465.2 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 40.4% from RMB2,356.9 million in the same quarter of 2021. The increase in total operating expenses was predominantly the result of the Company’s business expansion. Meanwhile, operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 85.0% in the third quarter of 2022 from 100.3% in the same quarter of 2021, due to increased economies of scale and the Company’s technology-driven operations.Cost of materials were RMB1,440.5 million (US$202.5 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 56.6% from RMB919.9 million in the same quarter of 2021, generally in line with the increase in the number of products sold and the increase in sales of materials to partnership stores.Store rental and other operating costs were RMB770.4 million (US$108.3 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 49.4% from RMB515.5 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in labor costs and store rental, as well as utilities and other store operating costs, as a result of the increased number of stores and items sold in the third quarter of 2022. Store rental and other operating costs increased proportionately less than revenues as a result of economies of scale.Depreciation and amortization expenses were RMB104.2 million (US$14.6 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 23.4% from RMB136.0 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the decrease in amortization of leasehold improvements for the stores whose leasehold improvements had been fully amortized before the third quarter of 2022, which was offset by the increase of depreciation expenses of additional equipment put into use in new stores in the third quarter of 2022.Delivery expenses were RMB432.8 million (US$60.8 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 62.1% from RMB266.9 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in the number of delivery orders.Sales and marketing expenses were RMB159.3 million (US$22.4 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 64.3% from RMB96.9 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly driven by (i) an increase in advertising expenses as the Company continued to make strategic investments in its branding through various channels, (ii) an increase in subcontract service fee, which was mainly for the Company’s e-commerce business and (iii) an increase in commission fees paid to third-party delivery platforms in line with the increase in the number of delivery orders. Sales and marketing expenses amounted to 4.1% of net revenues in the third quarter of 2022, which was the same as the third quarter of 2021.General and administrative expenses were RMB383.5 million (US$53.9 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 19.4% from RMB321.2 million in the same quarter of 2021.

General and administrative expenses amounted to 9.9% of net revenues in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 13.7% of net revenues in the same quarter of 2021. The decrease was mainly due to the economies of scale.Store preopening and other expenses were RMB9.5 million (US$1.3 million) in the third quarter of 2022, compared to RMB6.0 million in the same quarter of 2021, mainly due to more stores being opened in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of 2021. Store preopening and other expenses amounted to 0.2% of net revenues in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 0.3% of net revenues in the same quarter of 2021.Impairment loss of long-lived assets were nil in the third quarter of 2022, compared to RMB19.0 million in the same quarter of 2021.Losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring were RMB9.2 million (US$1.3 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 87.8% from RMB75.5 million in the same quarter of 2021, as the Company had successfully completed its provisional liquidation in March 2022 and substantially resolved all outstanding litigations. The losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring consisted primarily of professional and legal fees for U.S. securities litigations and other advisory service fees. Losses and expenses related to Fabricated Transactions and Restructuring amounted to 0.2% of net revenues in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 3.2% of net revenues in the same quarter of 2021.Store level operating profit margin – self-operated stores was 29.2% in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 25.2% in the same quarter of 2021, primarily due to the benefits of economies of scale from the increased number of products sold.GAAP operating income was RMB585.3 million (US$82.3 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing a GAAP operating income margin of 15.0%, compared to an operating loss of RMB6.7 million in the same quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating income was RMB693.8 million (US$97.5 million) in the third quarter of 2022, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 17.8%, compared to RMB71.4 million, or a non-GAAP operating income margin of 3.0%, in the same quarter of 2021.

The decrease was primarily attributable to the full redemption of the Company’s offshore notes following the restructuring of those notes on January 28, 2022, the settlement of payable to fulfill the Company’s obligations under the federal class action settlement and purchase of property and equipment, which was offset by operational cash generation and the proceeds from the issuance of senior preferred shares to Joy Capital on January 7, 2022.KEY OPERATING DATA  For the three months ended or as of    Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31, Mar 31, Jun 30, Sep 30,  2021 2021 2021 2021 2022 2022 2022               Total stores 4,951 5,259 5,671 6,024 6,580 7,195 7,846 Self-operated stores 3,939 4,018 4,206 4,397 4,675 4,968 5,373 Partnership stores 1,012 1,241 1,465 1,627 1,905 2,227 2,473 Same-store sales growth for self-operated stores 94.5% 71.8% 75.8% 43.6% 41.6% 41.2% 19.4% Average monthly transacting customers (in thousands) 8,728  12,285  14,722  16,229  15,975  20,712  25,103  KEY DEFINITIONSTotal net revenues include revenues from product sales and revenues from partnership stores.Revenues from product sales include net revenue from the sales of freshly brewed and non-freshly brewed items through self-operated stores, unmanned machines, e-commerce and revenue from delivery for self-operated stores.Revenues from self-operated stores include net revenue from the sales of freshly brewed and non-freshly brewed items through self-operated stores.Revenues from partnership stores include net revenue from the sales of materials, equipment, and other services including delivery and pre-opening services provided to partnership stores and profit sharing from partnership stores.Same-store sales growth for self-operated stores.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in the Company’s business, provide further information about the Company’s results of operations and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.The Company defines non-GAAP operating income/(loss) as operating (loss)/income excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP net income/(loss) as net income/(loss) excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and fair value changes of derivative asset bifurcated from Series B Senior Secured Notes and non-recurring item of provision for equity litigants and non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and fair value changes of derivative asset bifurcated from Series B Senior Secured Notes and non-recurring item of provision for equity litigants.For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this earnings release.EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATIONThis earnings release contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.1135 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on September 30, 2022 set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.REVISION OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe Company has revised its previously announced unaudited financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to reclassify the treatment of the foreign exchange impact of a planned capital reduction to transfer funds out of China for the settlement of overseas debt, which had been recorded in the Company’s foreign exchange gain, net. Following the revision, the Company has made adjustments in each successive period, including to its previously announced unaudited financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company has determined that it is more appropriate under GAAP to present the foreign exchange impact of capital reduction transactions in other comprehensive income, rather than in foreign exchange gain, net. The revision was non-cash and non-operating in nature and did not have any impact on the Company’s operating (loss)/income, assets or liabilities, or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company assessed the effects of the revision in the prior periods’ financial statements and determined that it is not material to any of the Company's prior interim and annual financial statements. For details on the impact of the revision, please see the note “Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements”.CONFERENCE CALLThe Company will hold a conference call today, on Tuesday, November 22, 2022, at 8:00 am Eastern Time (or Tuesday, November 22, 2022, at 9:00 pm Beijing Time) to discuss the financial results.Participants may access the call by dialing the following numbers:United States Toll Free:+1-888-317-6003International:+1-412-317-6061Mainland China Toll Free:400-120-6115Hong Kong Toll Free:800-963-976Conference ID:3372204As previously announced, all shareholders are able to submit questions to Luckin Coffee management by visiting https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=HRKFnvgS.

Following the revision, the Company has made adjustments in each successive period, including to its previously announced unaudited financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company has determined that it is more appropriate under ASC830 Foreign Currency Matters to present the foreign exchange impact of the capital reduction transaction in other comprehensive income, rather than in foreign exchange gain, net. The impact of the revision was a RMB107.7 million reduction to the Company’s foreign exchange gain, net, for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Correspondingly, the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 increased by the same amount, respectively. The revision was non-cash and non-operating in nature and did not have any impact on the Company’s operating (loss)/income, assets or liabilities, or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company assessed the effects of the revision in the prior periods’ financial statements and determined that it was not material to any of the Company's prior interim and annual financial statements.The following tables present the impact of the revision to prior period financials: For the six months ended June 30, 2021(Unaudited) As previouslyreported Adjustment As revised (Amounts in thousands of RMB)Foreign exchange gain/(loss), net109,056  (107,725) 1,331 Net loss(211,439) (107,725) (319,164)Foreign currency translation difference, net of tax of nil(64,862) 107,725  42,863 Total comprehensive loss(276,301) -  (276,301)Net loss per share -

FL posted better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2022, wherein the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. FL delivered the 10th straight earnings beat in the reported quarter.Driven by strong third-quarter results, robust demand and a healthy inventory, management raised the outlook for fiscal 2022. For the holiday season, management remains encouraged by the business momentum. Management expects a robust launch lineup, comprising the key releases of Jordan Retros, follow-up launches of Melo Ball 2, new Crocs collabs among others. Foot Locker’s FLX membership program and omnichannel capabilities appear encouraging.Shares of this athletic footwear and apparel retailer rallied 8.7% during the trading session on Nov 18. Over the past three months, the stock has increased 14.5% compared with the industry’s 2.5% decline.Q3 MetricsThe athletic shoes and apparel retailer posted adjusted earnings of $1.27 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. The bottom line decreased from $1.74 per share recorded in the prior-year fiscal quarter.Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseFoot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseFoot Locker, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Foot Locker, Inc. QuoteTotal sales of $2,173 million dipped 0.7% from the prior fiscal year’s level but came above the consensus estimate of $2,112 million. Excluding the foreign-currency fluctuation impacts, total sales grew 3.3%.Comparable-store sales (comps) inched up 0.8% in the fiscal third quarter, backed by strong demand, brand-diversification efforts and better access to high-quality inventory. The non-Nike sales across the company’s core banners grew mid-single digits. By category, footwear comped up in the low-single digits, while apparel and accessories declined mid-single digits.Comps in the company’s stores rose 4.7%. FL’s digital channel comped down 14.5% with the overall penetration at 16.3%, lower than the 19.8% witnessed last year, but above the 15.3% seen in 2019.Story continuesFoot Locker experienced sturdy demand signals within the basketball sneaker culture and kids. This trend is likely to continue into the fourth quarter. It saw outsized gains in brands like New Balance which was up about 70% in the reported quarter, Crocs and Converse, both were up over 25%, and UGG rose nearly 50%.The company’s controlled brands performed impressively, increasing above 50% on strong fleece and outerwear performance by CSG and Locker brands. However, apparel remained soft in the quarter.In North America, the overall comps decreased modestly 1.1%, with Foot Locker up high single digits on solid basketball trends and gains in the key back-to-school markets. Kids Foot Locker rose mid-single digits on broad-based strength across brands and solid marketing campaigns around the back-to-school season.Champs Sports dropped in low-double digits, but is up versus 2019. WSS contributed nearly $162 million in sales with comps up in the low single digits in the reported quarter.Further, comps in Europe grew 0.8%, backed by the strength in key markets, led by France, Italy and Spain. In Asia Pacific, comps surged 36.5%, driven by the easing of travel restrictions in certain Asian markets. Also, atmos witnessed strong trends with respect to the sneaker culture, contributing $40 million to sales and up double digits year over year on strong performance in Japan.In addition, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s community and Power Stores delivered healthy sales.An Insight Into MarginsFoot Locker's gross-margin rate in the reported quarter dropped 270 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Increased markdowns on higher promotional activity across the industry, and modest supply-chain cost pressures hurt the metric.The SG&amp;A rate deleveraged nearly 60 bps due to increased labor, partly offset by early savings from its cost-optimization program.Store UpdateDuring the fiscal third quarter, Foot Locker opened 24 stores, and remodeled or relocated 23 outlets. FL closed 29 stores during the aforementioned period.As of Oct 29, 2022, Foot Locker operated 2,794 stores across 28 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.  Also, FL had 155 franchised stores operating in the Middle East and Asia.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, management expects to open roughly 20 stores. It has plans to shut down nearly 85 stores in the aforementioned period.Other Financial DetailsFoot Locker ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $351 million. Long-term debt and obligations under finance leases amounted to $448 million, while shareholders’ equity summed at $3,259 million. As of Oct 29, 2022, merchandise inventories were $1,685 million, up 29.5% from the year-earlier quarter’s end level.During the reported quarter, Foot Locker paid out quarterly dividends of $37 million.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, total sales are likely to drop 8-10%, with comps falling 6-8%. Gross margin is likely to be 29-29.3%, while SG&amp;A rate is anticipated to deleverage 90-100 basis points to 23.3-23.4%. SG&amp;A deleverage will be caused by the ongoing wage inflation and comps decline, partly offset by an expected savings of nearly $9 million from the cost-optimization program. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be 45-53 cents a share for the fiscal fourth quarter.Management expects sales to decline 4-5% in fiscal 2022 compared with the earlier view of falling 6-7%. Currency is likely to act as a deterrent. Comps are likely to drop 4-5% compared with the prior guidance of 8-9% on the back of solid demand, execution and access to inventory.Gross margin is anticipated in the range of 31.7-31.8% compared with the prior view of 31.1-31.2%. The SG&amp;A rate is forecast to be 22% compared with the 21.3-21.4% rate guided earlier due to labor inflation, partly offset by cost optimization.FL now envisions adjusted earnings per share of $4.42-$4.50 for the full fiscal compared with $4.25-$4.45 projected earlier. Management predicts capEx at $275 million for fiscal 2022.At the end of the fiscal year, Foot Locker expects the inventories to remain up year over year, positioning the company strong to start in 2023. Management expects to conclude the year with a greater mix of Nike sales than earlier anticipated in addition to the robust demand across its portfolio.3 Top Retail StocksWe highlighted three better-ranked stocks in the Retail - Wholesale sector, namely Tecnoglass TGLS, Ulta Beauty ULTA and CVS Health CVS.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

305,472fedc4-f29e-30b3-a728-d965a1afd667,ULTA,2022-11-22,Will Ulta (ULTA) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-ulta-beat-estimates-again-171005329.html,1669050605,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This beauty products retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 28.41%.For the most recent quarter, Ulta was expected to post earnings of $4.96 per share, but it reported $5.70 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.92%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $4.44 per share, while it actually produced $6.30 per share, a surprise of 41.89%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Ulta. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ulta has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on December 1, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.09 a share, just 10 days from its upcoming earnings release on December 1, 2022.ULTA has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.09 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08.ULTA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at AutoZone (AZO) as well.AutoZone is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on December 6, 2022. AZO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $25.54 a share 15 days from its next earnings release.For AutoZone, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.82 is 2.91%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ULTA and AZO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.57bUS$4.95bUS$5.40bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.26bUS$6.47bUS$6.67bUS$6.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.2%Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$161bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$161b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$127b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$316, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.847. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Vertex Pharmaceuticals, we've put together three relevant elements you should assess:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Vertex Pharmaceuticals   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does VRTX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:INTU) prepared for the potential recession that may lie just ahead? Many economic and investment observers expect that the current recession in the real economy will translate to more concrete financial metrics soon, and if it does, then it makes sense to have some financially solid, well-established companies in our portfolios that can weather the storm.In this environment, I've turned to the legendary investor Peter Lynch for inspiration. Lynch had a ladder of stock categories, and one important category on that list was stalwarts. The stalwarts are established stocks that have grown their earnings by 10% to 20% per year.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTU. Click here to check it out. INTU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of INTUPeter Lynch Chart of INTUTo find such stocks, GuruFocus set up the stalwarts screener, which identifies stocks that have four key characteristics of stalwarts:They must have a business predictability ranking of at least 2 out of 5 stars.Their ROC (return on capital) or ROIC (return on invested capital) must average at least 14% per year over the past decade.Revenue growth over the past 10 years has averaged between 8% and 20%.Earnings per share without non-recurring items has grown between 10% and 20% per year for the past decade.In his book, One Up on Wall Street: How to Use What You Already Know to Make Money in the Market,"" Lynch had the following to say about the importance of stalwarts:I always keep some stalwarts in my portfolio because they offer pretty good protection during recessions and hard times... You know they wont go bankrupt, and soon enough they will be reassessed and their value will be restored...No matter how bad things get, people still eat cornflakes. They may take fewer trips, postpone the purchase of new cars... But they eat just as many cornflakes. [Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) was one of Lynchs stalwarts].Making the case for IntuitThe first criterion on the stalwart screener list is a business predictability ranking greater than 2 out of 5. Intuit meets that test with a business predictability ranking of 3.5 out of 5 stars, thanks to the relatively consistent growth of its revenue and Ebitda over time:Story continuesIntuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionThe second criterion is that ROC or ROIC must average at least 14% per year over the past decade. Consistency is hardly the word I would use to describe Intuits ROIC, so it must meet the requirement on the ROC front:Intuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionThe third criterion is revenue growth averaging between 8% and 19% per year. Notice that this screener has a ceiling for revenue growth; this is because faster growth is not consistent with the definition of a stalwart. For these stocks, GuruFocus offers the fast growers screener, which is where you can find stocks growing revenue between 20% and 25% per year.As shown above, Intuits revenue has grown in the correct range for a stalwart, averaging 12.13% per year:Intuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionThe fourth and final criterion is earnings per share without non-recurring items growth averaging between 10% and 19% per year. Again, Intuit makes the range at 15%:Intuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionThough the stock may technically meet the criteria, I am personally concerned by the low ROIC.FundamentalsOver the past five years, except this year, the stock has delivered robust total annual returns:2022 (to-date): -40.91%2021: 69.34%2020: 45.05%2019: 33.06%2018: 24.76%Based on its strong financial strength, profitability, growth, GF Value and momentum rankings, Intuit earns a very high GF Score of 97 out of 100:Intuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionTurning to the 10-K for 2022 (the company's fiscal year ended on July 31), the below chart from the 10-K shows how the stock has outperformed both a peer index and the S&amp;P 500:Intuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionOn the GF Score chart, the only area of weakness is the financial strength component, but I don't see that as much of an issue. The below screenshot of the company's GuruFocus financial strength table shows a strong Altman Z-Score of 7.21, meaning bankruptcy is not likely.Intuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionAccording to the balance sheet, Intuit had short-term debt of $499 million and long-term debt of $6.415 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Against that, it has $2.796 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as well as $485 million in marketable securities, for a total of $3.281 billion. The company should be able to maintain healthy cash balances based on these data points.As the last line on the financial strength table shows, Intuit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 7.57%, while ROIC is 10.51%. That means the company is creating value for shareholders.Add to that the growth rate of its free cash flow at 13.24%, and I believe this company's financials will be alright:Intuit: A Stalwart Stock for a RecessionCompared to its interest payments, it generates a significant amount of operating income of $2.571 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, which provides a healthy interest coverage ratio of 31.74.GurusGurus have a lot of confidence in Intuit; 17 of them have holdings in the stock, which is a relatively high number. The two biggest investors are Frank Sands (Trades, Portfolio) of Sands Capital Management with 1,339,551 shares (representing a 0.48% interest in Intuit and 1.95% of Sands latest 13F portfolio) and Andreas Halvorsen (Trades, Portfolio) of Viking Global Investments with 1,157,479 shares.Institutional investors own 85.39% of Intuit, while insiders own 0.51%. The biggest insider stake belongs to Brad Smith, a former CEO and executive chairman of Intuit.ConclusionIntuit may be weak on the ROIC criterion, but otherwise, it is a solid stalwart stock. It enjoys a suitable business predictability ranking and meets the criteria for revenue and earnings growth. It is the type of stock prudent investors will seek if they want recession protection and upside potential in my opinion.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Intuit hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Intuit peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Intuit will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Enough Growth For Intuit?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Intuit's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 3.4% decrease to the company's bottom line. Regardless, EPS has managed to lift by a handy 22% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the earlier period of growth. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 22% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 8.9% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Intuit is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Intuit's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  Intuit is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of Intuit's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Stryker’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Stryker What's The Opportunity In Stryker?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 9.1% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Stryker today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $247.13, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Stryker’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Stryker look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 45% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Stryker. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SYK’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SYK, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Stryker, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

To skip our discussion on the robotics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Robotic Stocks Under $10.According to Statista, the size of the industrial robotics segment is expected to compound annually at an average rate of 10% from 2021 to reach a size of $70.6 billion by 2028. Meanwhile, Coherent Market Insights believes that the size of the service robotics segment will compound annually at an average rate of 15.9% to reach $41.3 billion by 2028. Every notable player in the industry is trying to provide unique offerings to capture new markets in the robotics segment. The need for automation is increasing with every passing day, causing the adoption of robotics to grow rapidly.The adoption of robotics has been spearheaded by the food and beverage industry in the recent past as robots provided a replacement for human resources and proved to be time efficient. The food and beverage industry has been facing a significant shortage of labor since the COVID-19 pandemic as the workforce moved away from the food sector during the lockdown. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), the number of robots in the food and beverage industry grew by 25% YoY in 2021 to 3,402 units. One of the primary reasons for the rapid adoption of robots was a widespread belief that robots provided a higher level of hygiene and lowered human interaction during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.Meanwhile, the IFR estimates that half a million robots are already commissioned across the automobile, chemical, plastic production, machinery, electronics, food, and beverage industries. The steady growth in the adoption of robotics was partially hampered by supply chain-related challenges due to widespread lockdowns globally during the pandemic. Furthermore, in 2022, there have been supply-chain-related disruptions due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine impacting the commodities sector. Given the possibility of a recession with the rising cost of energy and labor shortages across numerous sectors, the adoption of robotics is expected to gain pace. Leading companies like International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), and Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) are investing heavily in research and development to develop robots and automated systems with unique features and higher applicability across different industries.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe have looked at the expansion plans and financial strength of these companies.

(SoCalGas) and Captura, a carbon removal company founded at Caltech, announced the deployment of an innovative, direct ocean carbon removal technology that uses 100% renewable energy and ocean water to draw down surplus atmospheric CO2.  The technology was recently installed at Caltech's Kerckhoff Marine Lab in Newport Beach and marks the first time the Captura system will be operating in ocean water conditions. Over the next few months, researchers will test and validate the energy efficiency costs and purity of the extracted CO2. Captura plans to scale up the technology to remove millions of tons of atmospheric CO2, which could help accelerate achieving California's climate goals.Captura""Just like solar panels, wind turbines, and clean fuels, carbon removal technologies will be essential tools in the clean energy transition,"" said Neil Navin, SoCalGas vice president for clean energy innovations. ""Supporting innovations like the Captura technology helps utilities like SoCalGas plan for the infrastructure investments that will be needed to reach California's climate goals affordably and reliably.""Carbon management technologies are expected to play an important role in meeting the state's climate goals. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom's recent ambitious climate proposal includes setting a 20 million metric tons (MMT) carbon removal target for 2030 and 100 MMT carbon removal target for 2045, emphasizing the role of natural and working lands and the need for safe and equitable engineered carbon removal.""The climate crisis is already having a staggering impact on California, from droughts and wildfires to heat waves and other catastrophic weather events,"" said Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris. ""These impacts are only expected to intensify, posing a significant threat to public health and our economy. State leaders need to deploy the full range of technologies available to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon removal, which leading experts have identified as a critical component of any successful strategy to meet our climate goals.""Story continues""Captura's process removes a measurable stream of CO2 from the ocean. We then return that de-carbonized water back into the ocean, which then absorbs the same quantity of CO2 from the air. The CO2 stream we produce can then be permanently sequestered or utilized in products,"" said Steve Oldham, CEO of Captura. ""We are grateful for the support that SoCalGas has provided Captura, enabling this initial pilot demonstration and assisting us in quickly scaling up the technology.""At commercial scale, Captura plans to deploy its technology atop offshore oil and gas platforms as they reach end of life. In this way, Captura can utilize existing infrastructure and co-locate the technology with existing storage sites. The company works closely with environmental health groups and ocean science experts for the protection of ocean ecosystems.Last year SoCalGas announced its aspiration to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its operations and the energy it delivers by 2045 and earlier this year released its ASPIRE 2045 Sustainability Strategy to help reach that goal.SoCalGas research has found that carbon management tools like Captura's, when combined with electrification and clean fuels like hydrogen and renewable natural gas, deliver the most affordable, resilient, and technologically proven path to full carbon neutrality.In 2021, SoCalGas joined the U.S. Department of Energy to fund testing of a first-of-its-kind direct air capture technology that captures carbon dioxide from the air while simultaneously collecting water that can be reused for irrigation. The company has a dozen carbon management projects in its Research, Development &amp; Demonstration portfolio, designed to develop new tools to help with decarbonization and net-zero innovation.Video of the pilot ocean carbon removal technology is available here.About SoCalGasHeadquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States. SoCalGas delivers affordable, reliable, and increasingly renewable gas service to 21.8 million consumers across 24,000 square miles of Central and Southern California.

Imaging experts are in short supply and high demand while, at the same time, imaging is moving beyond hospital campuses. By 2033, the U.S. alone could fall short by almost 42,000 of the needed radiologists and other specialist physicians 3 and burnout amongst healthcare professionals is a growing issue. Nearly two-thirds (61%) of radiologists suffer from burnout, up from 36% in 2013 to 49% in 2017. 4Imaging solutions integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), are aimed at supporting radiologists in meeting these challenges head on, by helping automate complex workload distribution, minimizing workflow steps, optimizing the workforce, and providing improved image quality to reduce scan time.""Radiologists are eager for the latest tools to keep up with an ever-increasing case load. GE Healthcare is focused delivering on technologies that not only help improve workflow efficiency and reduce burnout for our customers, but also provide better patient care. Our customers consistently ask for ‘fewer clicks’ and for actionable insights, and we design our solutions to meet those needs,"" said Jan Makela, President and CEO of Imaging at GE Healthcare.GE Healthcare’s Intelligent workload management solution is an option for its Picture Archive and Communications System (PACS) solutions, provided by the integration with Helix Radiology Performance Suite, developed by Quantum Imaging &amp; Therapeutic Associates. The innovative intelligent workload management solution, which leverages time-based predictive analytics, can help to optimize the radiologist workforce across an entire enterprise.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about General Electric. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.General Electric already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at General Electric's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in General Electric. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of General Electric Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$229m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand General Electric better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Since then, the company has made rapid progress in enhancing the developing technology, building a new system prototype to include:A larger detector with the possible goal of enabling quicker scan times as well as expanding coverage;ECG-gated cardiac scan capabilities designed for coronary artery imaging; andFaster acquisition speed with the intent to reduce the likelihood of blurred images due to motionii.""Photon counting CT has promise to embody the best of CT imaging available to date,"" explains Dr. Meghan G Lubner, professor of radiology at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. ""This technology has the potential to expand the scope of current indications by combining refined energy resolved data, high spatial resolution, reduced noise and improved soft tissue contrast. We are working with GE Healthcare by testing their novel photon counting solutions in human subjects to assess issues ranging from improving commonly encountered CT image quality limitations to evaluating whether previously out of reach clinical questions can now feasibly be answered.""Story continuesPhoton counting CT could potentially advance the capabilities of CT, including the visualization of minute details of organ structures, improved tissue characterization, more accurate material density measurement (or quantification) and lower radiation dose.GE Healthcare is pursuing a unique approach to photon counting CT, which may enable higher spatial and spectral resolution at the same time, thanks to several advantages provided by Deep Silicon detectors, including: the detector’s material purity, innovative geometric design, and true multi-bin technologies for high performance spectral imaging. As such, the research being done at UW–Madison will assist GE Healthcare in better understanding the heights of these unique capabilities.""Photon counting detectors push CT technology forward in two major ways: better spatial resolution and better contrast resolution,"" shares Tim Szczykutowicz, Ph.D., associate professor radiology at the school. Szczykutowicz is also affiliated with the Departments of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering. ""I think for CT, photon counting is undoubtedly the next big thing. We are a part of the process of evaluating and developing this unique approach to photon counting based on Deep Silicon technology.""UW–Madison will facilitate human subject research and produce technical feedback to test and advance GE Healthcare’s photon counting CT technology with Deep Silicon. The study will assess reconstruction methods, image presentation workflows, and clinical benefits for specific pathologies and disease types to determine how to best optimize photon counting CT with Deep Silicon detectors to enable better visualization and utilization.""Innovation requires close collaboration between medical technology innovators and academia,"" concludes Jean-Luc Procaccini, President &amp; CEO, Molecular Imaging &amp; Computed Tomography, GE Healthcare. ""We are thrilled to deliver our newest prototype to our long-time collaborators at UW–Madison and UW Health.

The unit generates more than $18 billion in revenue; it could easily digest Lantheus, which has a market cap of less than $4 billion. More importantly, of GE Healthcare’s operating units, pharmaceutical diagnostics has the least amount of revenue — just $2 billion in 2021 — so a pickup of a growth company like Lantheus would accelerate the newly public company’s growth trajectory. Estimates put GE Healthcare’s enterprise value at between $59 billion to $65 billion, about 20x the size of Lantheus. Celsius Holdings (CELH)A view of several cans of Celsius (CELH) energy drinks, on display at a local grocery store.Source: The Image Party / Shutterstock.comCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock is up 76.82% year-to-date and a whopping 2,472% over the past five years. The fitness energy drink company is one of the biggest growth stories of the past half-decade. If it were in the S&amp;P 500, it would have had the second-best performance over the past five years. In early August, Celsius announced it had signed a long-term distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Initially, Celsius only handed off its U.S. distribution to the world’s second-largest beverage company. Down the road, PepsiCo will take over global distribution. As part of the agreement, Pepsi bought $550 million in convertible preferred stock that paid a 5% annual dividend. If PEP converted the preferred shares to common equity, it would own 8.5% of Celsius. It has one representative on the Celsius board.Celsius generated $188.2 million in revenue in the third quarter, 98% higher than a year ago. Of that, just $8.7 million was outside the United States. PepsiCo’s global distribution network will turn that amount into merely a rounding error over the next couple of years. While losing money on a GAAP basis, its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) through the first nine months of 2022 was $57.5 million, 152% higher year-over-year. The company’s store count in the U.S. was over 174,000 at the end of the third quarter. Expect Pepsi to blow that number well beyond 200,000 in Q4. Maybe this turns out to be a similar deal to the one Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) made with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) in 2015, and Pepsi’s content with a minority position, or maybe it decides to bite the bullet and take out Celsius?It would have to appease Carl DeSantis, who owns or controls more than 24% of CELH stock. PDC Energy (PDCE)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comI recently included PDC Energy (NASDAQ:PDCE) in a group of seven companies that I thought were up-and-coming stocks to buy to retire a millionaire. However, I’ve got a hunch that Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) might be interested in acquiring the Wattenberg Field operator that also has operations in West Texas. In the third quarter, PDC produced 219,000 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent per day) in Colorado’s Wattenberg Field and 31,000 boe/d in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin.Now, I’m not going to pretend that I’m some hotshot geologist that knows a lot about the oil business. However, it’s hard not to notice that Diamondback will finish 2022 with production of 385,000 boe/d in the Permian Basin. Adding 31,000 from PDC would undoubtedly help strengthen its hold on this critical area of domestic oil production. Wattenberg would be an excellent diversifier from its existing business in Texas.This one’s a long shot, given Diamondback is currently digesting FireBird Energy LLC for $1.6 billion in cash and stock.But buy both, and you’ll be in dividend heaven even if nothing happens in the M&amp;A department.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Adams Resources &amp; Energy (AE). AE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.Investors should also recognize that AE has a P/B ratio of 1.01. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.06. Within the past 52 weeks, AE's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.71, with a median of 0.83.Finally, investors will want to recognize that AE has a P/CF ratio of 4.92. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 5.17. Within the past 12 months, AE's P/CF has been as high as 5.43 and as low as 3.29, with a median of 4.23.Investors could also keep in mind Valero Energy (VLO), an Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Story continuesValero Energy is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 6.36 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.06.

Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.47, with a median of 1.90.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Adams Resources &amp; Energy and Valero Energy are likely being undervalued right now.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy. The sharp decline in the stock market has investors and economists worried about the risks of a possible recession. According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance. We analyzed these stocks through their balance sheets, financial health, and dividend policies. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield, as of November 21.Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy14.

Revenue grew 21% and EPS grew 32% in the most recent reported quarter, and strong payment activity has persisted despite high inflation. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and was likely driven by adverse foreign exchange movements and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending.

Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7.

Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership. Similar to our prior presentations, one way to visualize the current portfolio and note recent changes versus the benchmark is to look at scatter plot of all of Distillate’s FSV holdings versus those in the benchmark with valuation on the vertical axis and free cash ϲow stability on the horizontal axis.”6. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Dividend Yield as of November 21: 1.74%Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in motion and control technologies.

These stakes are collectively worth over $848.3 million.Oakmark Funds mentioned Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

How do investors know which REITs to buy?Here are two of the leading office REITs, compared by eight different measures to help determine which is the better buy:SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is an office REIT and the largest office landlord in New York City with 62 buildings totaling 33.6 million square feet.Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) is a Boston-based office REIT with nearly 200 properties concentrated in the largest cities from Boston to Seattle. The firm calls itself “the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.”Size and diversity: Boston Properties has three times as many buildings under its portfolio. SL Green’s entire portfolio is in New York City, while Boston Properties’ portfolio is spread across the country. Boston Properties is the clear winner in this category.Long-term performance: Over the past five years, and without reinvesting dividends, SL Green has a total return of -9.96%, while Boston Properties’ total return is -24.82%. While both results are poor, SL Green has outperformed and gets the edge.Recent performance: Over the past five trading days, SL Green stock is up 6.93%, while Boston Properties stock is up 3.38%. Over the past month, SL Green is up 2.27% while Boston Properties is down 0.51%. SL Green gets the edge.Most recent quarterly operating results: Both companies recently reported third-quarter operating results. Boston Properties’ results were:Revenue of $784.4 million (up 8.6% from the third quarter of 2021).Funds from operations (FFO): $299.8 million (up 11% from third quarter of 2021).FFO margin: 38% (in line with third quarter of 2021).Story continuesFFO per share: $1.90 (up from $1.73 in third quarter of 2021).Revenue beat analyst estimates by 3.7%. Earnings per share (EPS) also bested the analyst estimates by a whopping 198%.By contrast, SL Green reported the following third-quarter operating results:Revenue: $190.5 million (flat from the third quarter of 2021).FFO: $114.2 million (down 10.0% from the third quarter of 2021).FFO margin: 60% (down from 67% in the third quarter of 2021).FFO per share: $1.80 (down from $1.97 in the third quarter of 2021).Revenue exceeded analyst estimates by 3.6%. EPS was also better than analyst estimates by 36%.Although both companies surprised to the upside, the clear edge goes to Boston Properties, whose numbers rose or were in line with third-quarter 2021, while SL Green’s numbers were flat or down from the previous year’s third quarter.Current dividend yield: The current dividend yield for SL Green is 9.18%. The current dividend yield for Boston Properties is 5.26%. SL Green clearly wins this category.Dividend growth: Over the past five years, SL Green has raised its annual dividend from $3.45 to $3.73, an increase of 8.1%. In March 2020, it changed its dividend payment schedule from quarterly to monthly. Over the past five years, Boston Properties has raised its annual dividend from $3.20 to $3.92, an increase of 22.5%. The clear edge goes to Boston Properties unless one needs monthly dividends.Dividend coverage by FFO: SL Green’s annual forward FFO is $6.69, and its forward annual dividend is $3.73. Therefore, the dividend payout ratio to FFO is 55%, which is within the 35% to 55% payout range that is usually cited as ideal for a REIT.Boston Properties’ forward annual FFO of $7.51 easily covers the forward dividend yield of $3.92, with a payout ratio of 52.1% — also within the ideal range. Slight edge to Boston Properties.FFO multiple (price/FFO): Similar to a stock’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-FFO (P/FFO) is a measure of a REIT’s current price to its next fiscal year consensus of FFO. The forward P/FFO for SL Green is 6.07. The forward P/FFO for Boston Properties is 9.91. Slight edge to SL Green.So, which is the better REIT to buy? SL Green comes out ahead on both recent and long-term performance, current dividend yield and FFO multiple. On the other hand, Boston Properties excelled in size and diversity, most recent operating results, dividend growth and dividend coverage. So it’s a 4-4 tie, but which categories are the most important?The answer in this competition depends upon your priorities as an investor. If income is your need, SL Green with its higher yield and monthly payments is the better stock to own. Another plus is SL Green’s superior short- and long-term performance, and that could continue with its 6.07 FFO multiple.On the other hand, if future safety is your concern, the edge goes to Boston Properties with its larger size, greater diversity, superior dividend growth and coverage. Its third-quarter results are also a positive factor.Each investor will just have to decide their own priorities and act accordingly.REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

American's filing did not identify an amount, but O'Melveny partner Andrew Frackman previously in court described it as ""very, very substantial.""American's fees could be expected to be at least tens of millions of dollars, given the length of the litigation, which included two trials and an appeal.An experienced partner at O'Melveny can bill at $1,200 or more hourly, U.S. court records in other cases show. Average partner compensation at 700-lawyer O'Melveny in 2021 was about $2.6 million, according to an American Lawyer report.A representative from American did not immediately comment on Monday, and a Sabre spokesperson did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Southlake, Texas-based Sabre is the country's largest owner and operator of a network that travel agents use to search and book flights listed by the airlines.Sabre will oppose the airline's demand for fees. It has said American's attorneys should not get anything, since the company won a $1 nominal verdict.The lawsuit against Sabre was filed in 2011 by US Airways, which later merged with American. The complaint accused Sabre of charging excessive fees and curbing competition in the flight-booking market.American alleged $300 million in damages at trial, where a team from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom defended Sabre and disputed the claims.Story continuesThe trial was the second in the case, after a 2016 jury verdict was wiped out by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.""Few cases involve such effort over such a long period of time,"" Frackman wrote in the fee filing.In July, Skadden partner Patrick Fitzgerald, representing Sabre, said in court that ""given the amount of fees we expect US Airways to seek, we think it makes sense to pursue settlement discussions.""Sabre and American tried for weeks to resolve the fee dispute out of court, filings show, but did not reach resolution.The case is US Airways Inc, for American Airlines Inc v Sabre Holdings Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. No. 1:11-cv-02725-LGS-JLC.For US Airways: Andrew Frackman of O’Melveny &amp; Myers; R.

Since 2013, American has invested more than $24 billion in modernizing our fleet by taking delivery of more than 600 new aircraft. Over the same period, we retired 670 older, less fuel-efficient planes through the end of 2021. The result: American has the youngest mainline fleet among U.S. network carriers, with an average age of 11.3 years old. At the end of 2021, 55% of American's mainline fleet was 10 years old or less.New aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A321neo, which incorporate the latest engine and airframe technologies, made up 17% of our total available seat miles (ASMs) in 2021. Approximately $3.6 billion, or 12% of our revenue during the year, stemmed from passengers flying on the market-leading, fuel-efficient aircraft in our fleet. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 reduces fuel use and CO2 emissions by an additional 14% over today's other most fuel-efficient single-aisle airplanes - and 20% better than the original 737 next generation aircraft when they first entered service.(1) The Airbus A320neo family delivers 20% fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared to previous generation Airbus aircraft.(2)Largely as a result of flying these more efficient aircraft, American has improved fuel efficiency by 10.2% compared with 2013, based on fuel burn per ASM. That adds up to 1.9 billion gallons of fuel saved and 19 million metric tons of CO2 avoided.At the end of 2021, American had 42 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft in our fleet. In January 2022, we announced our plans to exercise purchase options on an additional 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, bringing our firm order total to 88 additional deliveries through 2026. We also had 44 Airbus A321neo aircraft in our fleet at the end of 2021 and have agreed to purchase an additional 76 for delivery through 2026. Of the firm order for 76 aircraft, 50 are the latest generation and long-range Airbus A321XLR aircraft. By 2026, we expect approximately 34% of our ASMs will be flown by the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A321neo.Story continuesIn recent years, we have also made significant investments in updating our regional aircraft fleet. Smaller aircraft and shorter flights - which devote a larger percentage of overall flight time to takeoff and landing - come at a fuel-efficiency cost. However, our regional carriers enable American to serve many smaller communities and low-density markets that don't have the passenger traffic to support larger jets. This service plays a vital role in connecting members of those communities to other people, places and economic opportunities. American is committed to providing industry-leading regional service, while continuously working to make that service more fuel efficient. This includes retiring a number of small regional jets in recent years and replacing them with large regional jets - such as the Embraer 175 and the Bombardier CRJ900 - which are on average more fuel efficient. We also continue to evaluate emerging low-carbon technologies such as electric- and hydrogen-powered aircraft, which hold promise for use in regional air travel.American received a CDP Climate Change score of ""A-"" in 2021 - the highest score among airlines in North America, and one of only two airlines globally to score that high.Advancing Next-Generation AircraftDecarbonizing aviation requires near-term action to improve efficiency and significantly expand the use of SAF, but it will also depend on technological advancements that enable aircraft to be powered by low- and no-carbon fuel sources such as green hydrogen and electricity. American continues to engage with our aircraft suppliers and other key players in the aviation sector to support the advancement of next-generation aircraft.One initiative that will further this goal is American's investment in Vertical Aerospace Ltd., which is developing an emissions-free electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Designed for transporting customers quickly both between and within cities, Vertical's piloted four-passenger VX4 is projected to be capable of traveling distances over 100 miles at speeds over 200mph, while producing minimal noise and zero operating emissions.(1) https://www.boeing-me.com/en/products-and-services/commercial-airplanes/737-MAX.page.(2) https://aircraft.airbus.com/en/aircraft/a320/a320neo.Read MoreView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727561/American-Airlines-Fleet-Renewal]"

She's owned a clothing store. She opened a call center.But when it came to raising capital for her latest venture, Just Her Rideshare, the Charlotte, North Carolina, resident realized she had a knowledge gap. ""I've built small businesses, but I never had to fundraise on that scale,"" Evans says. ""I knew I needed to find out how to execute that. I'm good at some things, but as a small business owner you can't be good at everything.""Evans found help in the form of a 3Rs grant-Recovery, Rebuild, Resilience-from 1863 Ventures. The organization, supported by Principal® Foundation, offers leadership training and market access for people of color and women entrepreneurs. For Evans, that translated into team building and financial insights. For her community-and thousands of other communities across the U.S. that support small businesses-the benefits of such programs spread far and wide.Providing equitable support, all year longFocused events like Small Business Saturday help drive attention to the 30 million-plus small businesses in the U.S. But research demonstrates support is needed not just on one day, but throughout the year, year after year. That's particularly true for small businesses owned by people of color and women.For example, new research from the Global Financial Inclusion Index strongly indicates there's uneven access to financial security across gender and racial demographics. Women in the U.S. face more exclusion from the financial system than men, and access to financial products, tools, services, and advice proves more difficult for Black and Hispanic communities, the Index found.What helps? Programs provided by organizations like 1863 Ventures.Evans' idea-to create a safe space for women seeking a rideshare-was inspired by a community tragedy, the murder of a college student who mistook another car for her Uber driver. Since Just Her Rideshare's inception two years ago, Evans has weathered the amicable departure of a founding partner and plenty of ""no's"" in funding requests. The 3Rs program resonated at the right time. ""I see greatness in this idea, in the impact it may have, but there have been difficulties building a company of this magnitude,"" Evans says. ""I've gained so much benefit already.""Story continuesSmall business solutions: Starting with policies and communityThe number of women and people of color who own small businesses is increasing: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women employer businesses-those that employ others-have reached a total of 1.1 million, employing over 10 million workers. Approximately 18.7% of U.S. employer businesses are owned by people of color.However, that growth doesn't mitigate historic and continuing challenges. For example, Black people make up over 14% of the U.S. population, but only 2.3% of owners of employer firms. During the pandemic, 36% of Black business owners reported difficulties accessing credit, compared to just 29% of all survey participants.Those disparities play out in overall individual financial security, too. Women, for example, face worse outcomes on every measure of financial health, and women of color even more so.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.There hasn't been much to differentiate Eaton's and the market's earnings growth lately. It might be that many expect the mediocre earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Eaton peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Eaton.Is There Enough Growth For Eaton?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Eaton's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 11% gain to the company's bottom line. However, due to its less than impressive performance prior to this period, EPS growth is practically non-existent over the last three years overall. So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 16% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 8.9% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Eaton is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From Eaton's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Eaton's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Eaton has 2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Eaton.

350,c013333d-e0a8-3d64-8e71-6bf48a0b6a21,FRT,2022-11-22,3 REITs That Should Survive Dividend Cuts In A Bad Recession,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-survive-dividend-cuts-171319940.html,1669050799,STORY,"['MSFT', 'ESS', 'FRT', 'UHT']","[Although there’s been more positive inflation news lately, fears of a subsequent recession continue.Tech companies such as Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc., Tesla Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have been laying off thousands of workers. The Federal Reserve just released a report showing a sharp rise in American household debt. The new and pre-existing housing markets are at a standstill, with mortgage rates around 6.5%.Recessions, like inflation, can do real damage to real estate investment trusts (REITs) as tenants stop paying rent or space goes vacant. And when REITs lose revenue and funds from operations (FFO) decline, dividend cuts are sometimes possible.But many REITs survive the worst and manage to adapt during any economic cycle without cutting dividends. Here are three REITs from different subindustries that, based on their dividend history, earnings and other factors, should survive dividend cuts even through a bad recession:Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE: FRT) is a Maryland-based diversified REIT that owns 105 shopping malls and offices as well as 3,400 residential units. A member of the S&amp;P 500, Federal Realty Investment Trust has been in business since 1962 and is one of the oldest REITs on Wall Street.Federal Realty Investment Trust holds the REIT record for annual dividend increases of 55 years and counting. It recently increased its quarterly dividend from $1.07 to $1.08, and the $4.32 annual dividend yields 4%. The dividend is well covered by annual FFO of $6.28, and its third-quarter earnings beat expectations.In short, Federal Realty Investment Trust could be the most reliable dividend provider in the entire universe of REIT stocks.Essex Property Trust Inc. (NYSE: ESS) is a San Mateo, California-based residential REIT that owns and manages 62,000 apartment units in 253 communities, along with some retail space, in eight West Coast markets. Essex Property Trust was founded in 1971 and created its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994.Story continuesEssex Property Trust has a record of 28 consecutive years of dividend increases, making it an S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat. According to its website, it was the only REIT to increase its dividend during the recession in 2010.In the third quarter, Essex Property Trust increased its Core FFO by 18.3% from the third quarter of 2021. The forward FFO of $14.48 easily covers the annual dividend of $8.80, and yields 4.1%. This is well above the five-year average of 2.94%, so Essex Property Trust is not only a very reliable dividend provider, but down from its 52-week high of $363.36, it could be a bargain at its recent price of $212.18.Universal Health Realty Income Trust (NYSE: UHT) is a Pennsylvania-based healthcare REIT that owns and operates healthcare facilities such as acute care and rehabilitation hospitals, medical office buildings, free-standing emergency rooms and childcare centers. Universal Health Realty Trust has 71 properties across 20 states. About 60% of its properties are medical buildings and clinics.For 36 consecutive years, Universal Health Realty Income Trust has paid quarterly dividends. The $2.84 annual dividend yields 5.6% and has been raised nine times since 2017, with no cuts.Despite a year-over-year reduction in third-quarter FFO of $0.60 per share, the forward annual FFO of $3.57 still covers the dividend payout with room to spare.Another positive is that the chairman of Universal Health Realty Income Trust recently purchased more shares. Given that, as well as the dividend history and coverage, stock investors can sleep peacefully knowing that this dividend could be safe even in a recession.REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

""Taking easy steps to prevent FOG backups can avoid costly backups in the home, our wastewater systems, and adverse effects to our watersheds from overflows.""Traditional holiday staples like turkey, gravy, and all the trimmings come with fats, oils, and grease that, if poured down the drain, can adhere to the insides of pipes, causing clogs that lead to sewer overflows and backups.Yummy meals aside, the buildup of grease from such delights can restrict the flow of wastewater -- or worse yet -- block the homeowner’s or utility’s sewer pipes. Neither dishwashing detergents nor garbage disposals can properly break down these materials, which build up over time – act now, so you don’t get your tinsel in a tangle!Protect your pipes and watersheds by following these simple tips to prevent FOG overflows:Never pour grease into sinks, toilets, or down drains.Allow the grease to cool, and use a rubber scraper to remove the fat, oil, and grease from cookware, plates, utensils, and cooking surfaces. Then place the grease in a sealed container and dispose of it in the trash.Install baskets/strainers in the sink drain to catch food scraps and empty them into the garbage.Please remember that garbage disposals do not prevent grease from washing down the drain.Also, detergents that claim to dissolve grease may pass it down the line and cause problems in other parts of the wastewater system.Story continuesFinally, flushing wipes (even those labeled flushable or biodegradable) and paper towels down the toilet can wreak havoc on wastewater systems. Wipes and paper towels should be tossed in the trash!Pennsylvania American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), is the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to approximately 2.4 million people. With a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse U.S. publicly traded water and wastewater utility company.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders this past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-may-not-want-ignore-110205092.html,1669114925,STORY,['PEP'],"[While PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders have had a good week with the stock up 4.6%, they shouldn't let their guards down. Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$12m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, sold US$4.1m worth of shares at a price of US$176 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$185). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 15% of Hugh Johnston's holding.PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.PepsiCo Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PepsiCo. Specifically, insiders ditched US$6.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. PepsiCo insiders own about US$394m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At PepsiCo Tell Us?Insiders sold PepsiCo shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since PepsiCo is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PepsiCo. At Simply Wall St, we found 3 warning signs for PepsiCo that deserve your attention before buying any shares.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy. The sharp decline in the stock market has investors and economists worried about the risks of a possible recession. According to the latest survey conducted by Wall Street Journal, 63% of economists see the probability of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 49% in July’s survey. The report also mentioned that the last time a recession probability crossed 50% was in July 2020.In times of economic clampdown, analysts recommend loading up on blue-chip companies as they are leaders in the respective sectors. Moreover, these companies have excellent cash flows to their name, generating stable income for shareholders. Their strong balance sheets and sound financials make them secure investments during inflationary periods. This year’s returns also exhibited a remarkable performance of the blue chip companies relative to the rest of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index that tracks the performance of 30 prominent blue chip companies, is down 7.96% this year, compared with a 17.7% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of November 20.When it comes to blue-chip companies, investors often gravitate toward these securities because of their solid dividend policies. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) not only have solid financials but have also raised their dividends for decades. In addition to this, dividend stocks have outplayed their peers during previous periods of market turmoil. According to a report by Lord Abbett, dividends on average contributed 76% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 in each decade when annualized returns were less than 10% since 1929. In light of these arguments, we will discuss the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are blue-chip companies with long histories of sound financial performance. We analyzed these stocks through their balance sheets, financial health, and dividend policies. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yield, as of November 21.Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy14. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Dividend Yield as of November 21: 0.58%Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American multinational financial services company that provides a wide range of related services to its consumers.

The company's shareholder returns remained strong during the quarter as it repurchased shares worth over $1.6 billion. Moreover, it paid $474 million to shareholders in dividends, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks to buy now.Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past eight years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.49 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.58%, as of November 21. In addition to Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc.

Akre Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Baron Funds mentioned Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of global payment network Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) fell despite reporting financial results that exceeded Street estimates. Revenue grew 21% and EPS grew 32% in the most recent reported quarter, and strong payment activity has persisted despite high inflation. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and was likely driven by adverse foreign exchange movements and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending. We retain conviction due to Mastercard’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”13. Apple Inc.

Apple’s installed base is over 1.8 billion devices which helps drive a software and services business that has generated almost $80 billion of revenue over the past 4 quarters. As we have highlighted in the past, Apple’s relentless focus on the development and integration between hardware (especially ICs) as well as software, continues to add significant value for customers of its products and services. We expect this favorable competitive dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future.”12.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. Walmart Inc.

Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership. Similar to our prior presentations, one way to visualize the current portfolio and note recent changes versus the benchmark is to look at scatter plot of all of Distillate’s FSV holdings versus those in the benchmark with valuation on the vertical axis and free cash ϲow stability on the horizontal axis.”6. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Dividend Yield as of November 21: 1.74%Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in motion and control technologies.

These stakes are collectively worth over $848.3 million.Oakmark Funds mentioned Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“A former long-time holding, Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) made its way back into the Fund this quarter. We believe investors’ perception of the company as a short-cycle, diversified manufacturer that’s heavily tied to industrial production has become stale. Since becoming CEO in 2015, Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the portfolio to a longer cycle, higher growth, and higher return end markets. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition this calendar year, Parker Hannifin’s highly depressing aerospace segment will become its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses like clean energy technologies and factory automation-should further accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be as good or better than peers. At 12x next year’s cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

355,7c3f38b9-7935-34d7-9a8a-ff365b9376da,PEP,2022-11-22,3 Stocks That Could Be the Next Big M&A Targets,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-could-next-big-191633502.html,1668798993,STORY,"['PEP', 'PDCE', 'CELH', 'GE', 'LNTH']","[Bloomberg Law recently discussed the global mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) market. Their analysis pointed out that even though the 2022 M&amp;A volume is down from a record number of transactions in 2021, the potential deals in 2023 could be pretty standard relative to the pre-pandemic volume. “This year’s total M&amp;A deal volume was $3.1 trillion as of Oct. 28—roughly 11% behind the total annual M&amp;A deal volumes for 2017 and 2020. But with the typical push to close transactions by the end of the year still to come, 2022 could close the gap,” stated its Nov. 13 commentary. “Even if we see a Q4 as slow as Q4 2018 (which had the lowest volume of any Q4 since 2017), 2022’s total annual deal volume would surpass that of 2017 and 2020.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe publication’s analysis suggests that in my quest to find three stocks that could be the next big M&amp;A targets, I ought to start my search here in North America, focusing on software, real estate, real estate investment trusts, commercial services and the internet. As for the parameters to find my three stocks, I’ll focus on mid-cap stocks with significant revenue growth and larger competitors.LNTHLantheus Holdings$56.85CELHCelsius Holdings$97.24PDCEPDC Energy$74.37Lantheus Holdings (LNTH)Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock.Source: metamorworks / ShutterstockOf the three companies on my list, I’m least familiar with Lantheus Holdings (NASDAQ:LNTH), a Massachusetts-based developer of diagnostic and targeted therapeutics to help healthcare clinicians find, fight and follow disease. In business for more than 60 years, its revenues in Q3 2022 grew 134.4% to $239.3 million, generating $87.5 million in free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, it expects revenues to be at least $243 million, bringing its full-year revenues to $917 million at the midpoint of its guidance with adjusted earnings per share of at least $3.80. Should the company hit its midpoint estimate for revenue in 2022, it will have grown by 116% over 2021. Based on its current share price, Lantheus stock is trading at just 37.2x earnings and 4.8x revenue.Story continuesWho’s going to buy Lantheus? Well, if you look at the company’s 2021 10-K, it mentions GE Healthcare 30 times. It’s a major competitor.The only fly in the ointment is that it will be a busy year for GE Healthcare in 2023. Early next year, General Electric (NYSE: GE) will spin off its healthcare unit into a standalone, publicly traded company. The unit generates more than $18 billion in revenue; it could easily digest Lantheus, which has a market cap of less than $4 billion. More importantly, of GE Healthcare’s operating units, pharmaceutical diagnostics has the least amount of revenue — just $2 billion in 2021 — so a pickup of a growth company like Lantheus would accelerate the newly public company’s growth trajectory. Estimates put GE Healthcare’s enterprise value at between $59 billion to $65 billion, about 20x the size of Lantheus. Celsius Holdings (CELH)A view of several cans of Celsius (CELH) energy drinks, on display at a local grocery store.Source: The Image Party / Shutterstock.comCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock is up 76.82% year-to-date and a whopping 2,472% over the past five years. The fitness energy drink company is one of the biggest growth stories of the past half-decade. If it were in the S&amp;P 500, it would have had the second-best performance over the past five years. In early August, Celsius announced it had signed a long-term distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Initially, Celsius only handed off its U.S. distribution to the world’s second-largest beverage company. Down the road, PepsiCo will take over global distribution. As part of the agreement, Pepsi bought $550 million in convertible preferred stock that paid a 5% annual dividend. If PEP converted the preferred shares to common equity, it would own 8.5% of Celsius. It has one representative on the Celsius board.Celsius generated $188.2 million in revenue in the third quarter, 98% higher than a year ago. Of that, just $8.7 million was outside the United States. PepsiCo’s global distribution network will turn that amount into merely a rounding error over the next couple of years. While losing money on a GAAP basis, its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) through the first nine months of 2022 was $57.5 million, 152% higher year-over-year. The company’s store count in the U.S. was over 174,000 at the end of the third quarter. Expect Pepsi to blow that number well beyond 200,000 in Q4. Maybe this turns out to be a similar deal to the one Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) made with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) in 2015, and Pepsi’s content with a minority position, or maybe it decides to bite the bullet and take out Celsius?It would have to appease Carl DeSantis, who owns or controls more than 24% of CELH stock. PDC Energy (PDCE)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comI recently included PDC Energy (NASDAQ:PDCE) in a group of seven companies that I thought were up-and-coming stocks to buy to retire a millionaire. However, I’ve got a hunch that Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) might be interested in acquiring the Wattenberg Field operator that also has operations in West Texas. In the third quarter, PDC produced 219,000 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent per day) in Colorado’s Wattenberg Field and 31,000 boe/d in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin.Now, I’m not going to pretend that I’m some hotshot geologist that knows a lot about the oil business. However, it’s hard not to notice that Diamondback will finish 2022 with production of 385,000 boe/d in the Permian Basin. Adding 31,000 from PDC would undoubtedly help strengthen its hold on this critical area of domestic oil production. Wattenberg would be an excellent diversifier from its existing business in Texas.This one’s a long shot, given Diamondback is currently digesting FireBird Energy LLC for $1.6 billion in cash and stock.But buy both, and you’ll be in dividend heaven even if nothing happens in the M&amp;A department.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

356,667b2c86-5c6e-38a2-b784-4bab98963756,PEP,2022-11-22,5 Food Stocks Positioned to Profit in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-food-stocks-positioned-profit-142639099.html,1668781599,STORY,"['PEP', 'KHC', 'GIS', 'K', 'MCD']","[You can live without an iPhone. You can live without a new house. Even the latest Hollywood thriller isn’t something that’s absolutely necessary. However, you can’t live without food – and that’s what makes food stocks a key investing priority of long-term conservative types.Food companies are the ultimate value stocks, given that they’re consistently profitable. When times are good, food stocks consolidate and create value with brand extensions. In times of inflation, these companies keep margins high by making smaller packages for the same price. Indeed, even in times of recession, investors clamor to hold food stocks, given the essential products they provide to a clientele that’s still buying, even when they’re cutting back everywhere else.Not all food stocks are great investments. This year, various protein players in the market like animal protein company Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and plant-based protein company Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), have been losing investments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat said, food stocks that operate in grain-based segments of the market appear to be handling inflation the best. Despite the price of wheat surging from around $8/bushel in 2022 to much higher levels flowing the the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the willingness to pay of consumers among grain-based foods appears to remain high.Thus, whether we’re talking about cookings, chips, or bread, consumers want it, and are willing to pay up. Indeed, I think 2023 could be set up as a year for staples. Accordingly, here are three companies worth considering right now.GISGeneral Mills$79.77KKellogg’s$70.03PEPPepsico$180.03KHCKraft Heinz$37.75MCDMcDonald’s$273.36General Mills (GIS)General Mills Cereal, GIS stockSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comFirst on my list of top food stocks to buy is giant General Mills (NYSE:GIS). From a performance standpoint, it makes sense to start here. That’s because the stock is up about 16% this year. Recently, General Mills increased its dividend 6% to $2.16 per year, reflecting a yield of 2.8%. It currently has a price to earnings multiple of 16.5-times.Story continuesGeneral Mills’ success comes from processing grains and milk into highly-profitable products. Famously, the company makes brands such as Old El Paso Mexican food and Totino’s pizza, Yoplait yogurt and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. General Mills also makes Blue Buffalo dog food, Epic protein bars, Bold Cultr milk-free cheese and Annie’s macaroni and cheese.That’s a long list to be sure. But the business is relatively simple, starting with milling grain into cereal and flour. However, turning a commodity into something consumers want isn’t easy. Accordingly, the company’s CEO has long said General Mills’ brands must “stand for something.” That’s because the company is in a constant fight against generics and store brands.Analysts seem to like the company’s business model, with Jefferies analysts projecting GIS to turn in earnings of $1.14 per share next quarter. Similarly, other analysts have been raising their price targets.The key reason to own GIS stock is its defensive posture and diversified portfolio of brands. This is a slow-growing company, but in a slow-growth economy, that could be just what investors need.Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIn 2022 Kellogg (NYSE:K) lost patience with breakfast cereal. I think what’s turned out to be a dramatic shift for the company could result in faster growth ahead.The company announced in June it will spin-off its North American cereal business. This massive segment provided sales of $2.4 billion, making its cereal business a significant company in its own right. Overall, the company plans to separate into three independent companies, in a bid to accelerate growth.The pre-split company, with sales of $14.2 billion in 2021, is now worth $23.9 billion, up about 5% on the year. That translates to a price to earnings ratio of around 16-times, with a dividend yielding 3.4%. If the break-up works as intended, it should yield faster growth for the main company and two attractive buy-out candidates for investors.Tomorrow’s Kellogg will be a global snacking business, using some of the cereals’ branding. North America will represent half the new Kellogg’s sales. The division represents 80% of total sales.Since the split was announced, Kellogg stock has traded sideways. That’s because investors and analysts gave a thumbs-down to Kellogg’s third quarter numbers, which showed almost no growth. Operating cash flow during the quarter, however, rose to $1.18 billion.Pepsico (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsico (NYSE:PEP) is best known for soda. But it’s also the biggest food processor in the U.S. On a global scale, it’s number two, behind only Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY).Most of Pepsi’s food sales come from the acquisitions of Frito-Lay in 1965 and Quaker Oats in 2000. When Pepsi bought Quaker Oats, it was assumed drinks like Gatorade would be the star. But Quaker also makes snack bars and cookies.The company wins by being constantly ready to innovate. This year, Pepsi announced it will introduce Ghost Kitchens to help its partners deliver hot food to consumers based on its brands. It’s replacing diesel with cooking oil in some of its delivery trucks. Further, the company is investing directly in global agriculture, and is quietly moving into alcohol.In its third quarter report, Pepsi’s net income grew to 8.8% year-over-year, coming in at $2.7 billion or $1.95 per share.  These earnings came on revenue of $21.97 billion. Analysts worried that food sales fell 1.5% but most still have a buy rating on the stock.Pepsi is often compared to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), but the two companies are very different. Coke remains committed to beverages, recently adding coffee and sports drinks brands to its portfolio. Pepsi remains tied to food, linking with Beyond Meat last year. The two debuted a plant-based beef jerky in May.Pepsico is a steady performer, providing welcome diversification in any portfolio that may get bloated with technology and other fast-growth stocks. Pepsi shares are up 57% in the last 5 years, and are even up this year. The company’s dividend, now yielding 2.6%, is also always welcome by long-term investors.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comMany laughed when Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) combined Heinz with Kraft Foods in 2015, under the leadership of Brazil’s 3G Capital, to create Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC).While some are still launching, and Kraft Heinz likely remains one of Buffett’s few mistakes, I think this is a stock worth considering. Shares of KHC stock are still down about 50% from where they were when the deal was done. However, Berkshire still has a 26% stake in the company, and under CEO Miguel Patricio, progress is finally being made. The stock held its own in 2022, with investors attracted by a dividend yielding 4.3%.For the September quarter, Kraft Heinz beat estimates with net income of $432 million, or 35 cents per share, on revenue of $6.5 billion. The company reaffirmed guidance of high single-digit growth. Net income was down, but the company cut its debt and future interest costs during the quarter.When Kraft was split up a decade ago, higher-margin products like Oreo cookies went to a new company, Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ). The assumption was that cookies would out-run things like Velveeta, Heinz ketchup and Oscar Meyer deli meats. Over the last five years, that’s been the case, with Mondelez up 53% and Kraft down a similar amount. An accounting scandal late in the last decade didn’t help.However, in 2022, this trend has reversed. Mondelez is down and Kraft Heinz is up, if only by a little bit. Patricio shed Planter’s nuts and the company’s natural cheese business, focusing instead on quirky marketing for traditional brands. Patricio insists the best is yet to come, and he’s seeking innovation with plant-based cheese. I agree, and think now is the time to get into KHC stock.McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comEver since former CEO Steve Easterbrook shifted the company’s strategy in 2015, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has been a winning investment. Shares of MCD stock have risen at twice the rate of the S&amp;P 500, and the company’s dividend is up 62% to $6.02 per year, yielding 2.2%.The key for these results appears to be the company’s supply chain, on which McDonald’s spends $14 billion per year. This includes private protein providers like Tyson, but also thousands of other, mainly privately-owned, food companies.Long-term, mutually-profitable relationships are what make McDonald’s the world’s largest food service operation. With over 38,000 locations in 100 countries, 93% of McDonald’s locations are operated as franchises.Easterbrook left after a sex scandal in 2019, but successor Chris Kempczinski continued in the same strategic direction. Thus, strong performance has been reflected in the company’s numbers. Last year, McDonald’s brought in margins of 32% on its whopping $23.2 billion in revenue. While the company’s market capitalization sits right around $200 billion, almost six times that of its nearest rival YUM! Brands (NYSE:YUM), I still think this is a stock with more upside from here.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in PEP.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Libtayo® (cemiplimab) as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.""Despite recent advancements in the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer, there remain limited options for people with recurrent or metastatic cases,"" said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. ""Libtayo was the first PD-1 inhibitor to demonstrate significant improvements in survival compared to chemotherapy in a Phase 3 trial. With this fourth approval from the European Commission, Libtayo can now be extended to appropriate patients in the European Union with advanced cervical cancer, irrespective of their PD-L1 status or histology.""The EC approval in advanced cervical cancer is based on data from the global Phase 3 EMPOWER-Cervical 1 trial, which was conducted with the GOG Foundation, Inc. (GOG), the European Network for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT) and NRG Oncology-Japan. The trial evaluated Libtayo in comparison to an investigator's choice of chemotherapy and enrolled 608 patients across 14 countries, irrespective of PD-L1 expression status or histology. In March 2021, the trial was stopped early based on the highly significant effect of Libtayo on overall survival (OS) among squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients following a unanimous recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee.""Consistent with our mission to bring the best treatments to patients across Europe living with gynaecological cancers, we are proud to have been a part of the landmark ENGOT-cx9/GEICO/EMPOWER Cervical-1 trial for Libtayo,"" said Professor Ignace Vergote, investigator and gynecologist oncologist at University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium, and Vice-Chair of the Trial Steering Committee. ""Libtayo is an important advancement for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer whose disease has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and could offer a new standard of care in this setting. We are grateful to those who participated in the trial and to our partners at Regeneron, ENGOT, the GOG Foundation and NRG Oncology-Japan without whom this approval would not have been possible.""Story continuesCervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 35 and 44. Approximately 600,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 350,000 deaths from cervical cancer occur worldwide each year. Almost all cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, with approximately 80% classified as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; arising from cells lining the external portion of the cervix) and the remainder largely adenocarcinomas (arising from glandular cells lining the internal portion of the cervix). Cervical cancer is often curable when detected early and effectively managed, but treatment options are more limited in advanced stages.In addition to today's approval, Libtayo is approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).About the Phase 3 TrialEMPOWER-Cervical 1 was an open-label, multi-center Phase 3 trial that investigated Libtayo monotherapy versus an investigator's choice of commonly used chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients (median age: 51 years) were randomized to receive Libtayo (350 mg every three weeks) or chemotherapy (pemetrexed, vinorelbine, topotecan, irinotecan or gemcitabine). The primary endpoint for the trial was OS, analyzed first among patients with SCC, then in the total population.Patients were allowed to enroll regardless of PD-L1 expression status, with 78% of patients having SCC and 22% having adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma. The trial included women from 14 countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the U.S.Results from the trial demonstrated that those treated with Libtayo (n=304) compared to chemotherapy (n=304) experienced significant improvements in OS, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) including a:31% reduction in the risk of death and a longer median OS in the overall population (12.0 months Libtayo, 8.5 months chemotherapy; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56 to 0.84; p=0.00011).27% reduction in the risk of death and a longer median OS in patients with SCC histology (11.1 months Libtayo, 8.8 months chemotherapy; HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.91; p=0.00306).25% reduction of risk in progressive disease in the overall population (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.89; p=0.00048).16% ORR for Libtayo, versus 6% for chemotherapy in the overall population (95% CI: 12.5 to 21.1 vs. 3.8 to 9.6).Safety was assessed in 1,281 patients with advanced solid malignancies who received Libtayo monotherapy in five clinical studies. The median duration of exposure to Libtayo was 28 weeks (range: 2 days to 144 weeks). Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with Libtayo and led to permanent discontinuation in 4.6% of patients. The most common immune-mediated adverse reactions were hypothyroidism (6.8%), hyperthyroidism (3.0%), immune-mediated pneumonitis (2.6%), immune-mediated hepatitis (2.4%), immune-mediated colitis (2.0%) and immune-mediated skin adverse reactions (1.9%). Adverse events were serious in 32.4% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation in 9.4% of patients. The grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in &gt;1% of patients were anaemia (5.2%), hypertension (2.6%), fatigue (2.6%), urinary tract infection (2.3%), hepatitis (1.8%), musculoskeletal pain (1.8%), rash (1.6%) dyspnea (1.2%) and pneumonitis (1.1%). No new Libtayo safety signals were observed.Results from the trial were previously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Regeneron in OncologyAt Regeneron, we're applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer. Our oncology portfolio is built around two foundational approaches – our approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo and investigational bispecific antibodies – which are being evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with emerging therapeutic modalities. Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop potentially synergistic treatments for a wide range of solid tumors and blood cancers.If you are interested in learning more about our clinical trials, please contact us (clinicaltrials@regeneron.com or 844-734-6643) or visit our clinical trials website.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries, Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in advanced cervical cancer in the EU, Canada and Brazil. As of July 1, 2022, Libtayo is developed and marketed globally by Regeneron.In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Outside of the U.S. the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved Indications Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:People with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.People with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC):Adults with a type of lung cancer called NSCLC:It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?LIBTAYO is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system.

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Some Growth For Regeneron Pharmaceuticals?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 24%. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 155% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 7.1% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 8.9% growth per annum, that's a disappointing outcome.With this information, we find it concerning that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.We've established that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals currently trades on a higher than expected P/E for a company whose earnings are forecast to decline. When we see a poor outlook with earnings heading backwards, we suspect share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that you should be aware of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

359,98a678fd-cd63-3253-97fb-aeef1b85af47,UNP,2022-11-22,Should You Think About Buying Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-union-pacific-corporation-130136775.html,1669122096,STORY,['UNP'],"[Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Union Pacific’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 9.83% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $193.27, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Union Pacific’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Union Pacific look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Union Pacific's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? UNP’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UNP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Union Pacific at this point in time.

I should also note, of course, the longtime legendary CEO of Gap and J.Crew. Mickey, always good to see you. Where are all the shoppers they're not buying anything.MICKEY DREXLER: Well, they probably will. My guess is they're waiting for the prices to drop. I think Black Friday probably started a week or so ago. Everyone seems to be on sale with lots of price cuts. And it's been a tough go the last month or two.BRIAN SOZZI: I have to give you a shoutout. I think it was three or four months ago, you were on Yahoo Finance Live. And you said, Brian, I'm not seeing a lot of good things in retail. And nothing good really has come out of retail. Since you said that, margins under pressure, Retailers with too much inventory. How do you think this holiday season ultimately shakes out?MICKEY DREXLER: It's funny that you said that. I have a lot of people say, why are you so negative? I say, because it's negative out there. I think it's-- I don't know for sure. It has to be difficult because of the discounts and Black Friday literally started a week ago with most people. I don't think it's easy to call. My hunch is, it will be not a good one, but we'll see.BRIAN SOZZI: When will inventories get past their peak? I'm in a Target. I'm in a Walmart. I go-- recently went yesterday to Roosevelt Field Mall. There's so much inventory in these stores.MICKEY DREXLER: They're in the stores--BRIAN SOZZI: When is it gonna go away?MICKEY DREXLER: But there's more in the distribution centers. Some of the companies are OK. I think it'll go away when the prices get low enough to move the goods. But we all planned too ambitiously for this fall and holiday, and we own the goods. And if you don't make plan, which I don't think many people are, you'll just have the goods stack up.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Who ultimately wins in this environment?MICKEY DREXLER: In this environment? Well, last week, I think Walmart won. I'm trying to think of who else won.BRIAN SOZZI: I think that was the first-- I've never heard you mention Walmart.MICKEY DREXLER: Well, I don't usually, but I think it's interesting. That was a food win. And they counted as retail. But I think half their business is food. A few others reported, and a lot of the reporting says they beat estimates. But estimates seem to be very conservative. I don't know who else won, really. I don't recall--BRIAN SOZZI: Macy's was a surprise, a surprise winner.MICKEY DREXLER: A surprise, but again, you have to see the margins. And you have to see how they end up this quarter. November, from what I hear-- and we had the same-- was very difficult. And now we're, I guess, entering-- I think we're in the second week or third week. But what I hear anecdotally is that people are complaining about business.BRIAN SOZZI: Is Black Friday still a big thing?MICKEY DREXLER: I think it's been promoted to the n-th degree. I think it's almost a cliche. And I don't think it's a big deal personally, but we don't-- I've never been involved in the Black Friday business. So it's a big deal, and TV makes it a bigger deal with lots of people lined up at the store.BRIAN SOZZI: You have to keep the lights on, Mickey. You have to keep the lights on.MICKEY DREXLER: Yeah, right, so.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us about your-- well, your former employer, Gap. Now they don't have a permanent CEO in there. Why don't they just give you the gig?MICKEY DREXLER: Well, I got into trouble when I saw you last time.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes, you did.MICKEY DREXLER: So there were a lot of my friends there. I ended up having to apologize to a number of them. So I really can't talk about them.BRIAN SOZZI: What's their place? What should they look like?MICKEY DREXLER: Well, they should look like Gap looks. I think it's a great opportunity to be the all-American uniform-ish with very fair prices and with good-looking clothes, lots of color. But everyone needs to look good. And, you know, I think they'll do much better.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us a little about Alex Mill. Why are you still in the game?MICKEY DREXLER: Well--BRIAN SOZZI: This is in your blood, I imagine.MICKEY DREXLER: Yeah, well, the game to me is a hobby and a sport. My son started it about 10 years ago. And I always liked the name. And I liked what I had felt there. I left J.Crew, and I was a little bored. I was on some boards and all that. And then I joined him, and I have [INAUDIBLE], who was with me for 15 years at Madewell and J.Crew. He quit on the temporary CEO. And so I put them together, and I said, wow, I'm employed again. So I'm in work every day because I don't know what else I do. I don't play golf. I don't sit on the couch much.BRIAN SOZZI: But you're a bit of a celebrity here. We were sitting over around the corner. Somebody came over to completely unprompted, said, hey, Mickey Drexler. You must be Mickey Drexler. I sent an email to you 20 years ago, and you replied. You acknowledged that something was wrong with the product. I don't see a lot of other merchants do that. But give some advice to these retail CEOs who may not be doing that.MICKEY DREXLER: Well, most big corporations-- this is my personal, private opinion-- very bureaucratic. You have to touch the team.

Its sister company Athleta will debut here next in 2023 via the same agreement.The two brands follow Gap, which made its own comeback in the region earlier this year.More from WWDJenny Packham RTW Spring 2023Edeline Lee RTW Spring 2023They Are Wearing: Street Style at London Fashion Week Spring 2023As reported in March, Gap opened its first, new-generation shop-in-shop inside Next plc’s largest West End store on London’s Oxford Street, part of the joint venture agreement that was formed in 2021 after Gap Inc. pulled its businesses out of the U.K.Next plc is one of the few historic high street retailers to have survived the rapid rise of online shopping, soaring commercial property prices and COVID-19.Athleta will make its debut in the U.K. via a new joint venture between Gap Inc. and Next plc.The British retailer manages the Gap-branded shops at Next locations, as well as Gap’s e-commerce business.Next plc has 500 physical stores in the U.K. and Ireland, while the Next.co.uk marketplace carries more than 700 fashion, home and beauty brands. The Leicester, England-based company is also part-owner of high street clothing brand Reiss, and is the U.K. partner for brands including Laura Ashley home and Victoria’s Secret.The Gap.co.uk site has already migrated to the Next Total Platform, a services provider for online businesses. Gap has branded shops-in-shop at Next stores in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Thurrock, England, and in Glasgow, Scotland.Banana Republic will be relaunching in the U.K. with a curated collection for women and men that will be available on Next.co.uk. Athleta will enter the U.K. market in early 2023 on Next.co.uk.As reported, Gap is the largest brand shop within Next’s Oxford Street store, and spans more than 4,000 square feet. The space is smaller than the former Gap stores here, and the design is meant to be more “open, modern and minimal.”Story continuesIn July 2021, Gap announced plans to close all 81 of its company-operated stores and outlets in the U.K. following a strategic review of its European operations. Two months later, it inked the joint venture with Next.The U.K. was the first European market Gap entered, and the late ’80s and ’90s were among its most successful decades. It boasted big-box stores in prime locations, including Oxford and Regent streets in London.Jon Jeffery, managing director of the JV, said his hope was that the new iteration of Gap in the U.K. would “restore belief” in the brand’s pricing. “We know that our customers recognize value for money delivered through innovation, quality and attention to detail. To that end we will focus more on delivering great products, and less on promotions and discounts.”]"

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 one day from its next quarterly earnings release on November 22, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.62 a share.Dick's Sporting Goods' Earnings ESP sits at 17.23%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24.DKS is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Gap (GPS).Slated to report earnings on March 2, 2023, Gap holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.14 a share 101 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gap is $0.05, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 181.25%.Story continuesDKS and GPS' positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) share price is up 29% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 13% in the last year.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Cisco Systems managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.6% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Cisco Systems' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Cisco Systems's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Cisco Systems, it has a TSR of 50% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Cisco Systems returned a loss of 10% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future.

CSCO recently overtook the 200-day moving average, and this suggests a long-term bullish trend.The 200-day simple moving average is a useful tool for traders and analysts, establishing market trends for stocks, commodities, indexes, and other financial instruments over the long term. The marker moves higher or lower along with longer-term price moves, and serves as a support or resistance level.CSCO has rallied 11.7% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests CSCO could be on the verge of another move higher.Once investors consider CSCO's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 2 higher, and the consensus estimate has increased as well.Investors should think about putting CSCO on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

368,34748827-ae59-32f4-b38e-ca4d3a705dc1,CSCO,2022-11-22,3 Stocks to Watch as Company Layoffs Grab Center Stage,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-company-layoffs-121722705.html,1668860242,STORY,"['META', 'AMZN', 'CSCO']","[It’s getting ugly out there. That’s especially true in the tech sector, where a growing number of companies are undertaking mass layoffs. Heading into the end 0f the year, some technology companies have announced the biggest workforce reductions in their history as their businesses slow and they grapple with ongoing supply chain issues and persistent inflation. Layoffs are typically a sign of trouble at a company and important for investors and shareholders to pay attention to. Here are three stocks to watch ahead of a potential recession as layoffs grab center stage.METAMeta Platforms$110.40AMZNAmazon$92CSCOCisco Systems$47/80Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comLaying off 11,000 workers in one fell swoop will generate some media headlines. And that is exactly what happened to Meta Platforms (NASDSQ:META), which cut 13% of its staff in early November amid mounting financial losses at the parent company of Facebook. It was the biggest round of layoffs ever at the social network, and the cuts garnered media attention the world over.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe dismissals come amid a difficult time for Meta Platforms, which continues to spend heavily on new technologies for the virtual reality world known as the “metaverse” and moves further away from its social media platforms that include Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Facebook. The company has spent $9.4 billion on metaverse technologies in 2022 alone.Prior to the headcount reduction, Meta Platforms provided lukewarm guidance for the fourth quarter that caused its shares to plummet 20% in a single day. Analysts have been concerned about Meta’s rising costs, as its expenses rose 19% year-over-year in the third quarter to $22.1 billion. At the same time, Meta’s sales declined 4% YOY to $27.71 billion in Q3.Impacted employees received 16 weeks of pay plus two additional weeks for every year that they were employed at the company. Meta Platforms also said that it would cover the health insurance of its dismissed employees for six months. Meta Platforms had more than 87,000 employees worldwide before the cuts were announced.Story continuesIn 2022, META stock is down 67%, and it’s now trading trading at $110.40 per share, making it one of the worst performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index this year.Amazon (AMZN)amazon (AMZN) sign with dark backgroundSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comStaffing has been a key area of focus for e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as it tries to adjust its global operations coming out of the pandemic. In mid-November, the Seattle based company confirmed that it plans to lay off 10,000 of its employees across the entire company, making it one of the top tech stocks to watch. The cuts followed earlier news that Amazon had halted all corporate hiring amidst a slowing economic environment.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told staff in an internal memo leaked to the media that job cuts at the company are likely to continue in 2023 as senior management  conducts its annual planning. The employee reductions come after Amazon hired rapidly and expanded aggressively during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people around the world were forced to shop online.Other measures Amazon has taken to course correct coming out of the pandemic have included selling multiple warehouses, canceling several projects, and closing its telehealth unit. So far, the changes have done little to help Amazon’s finances, which have missed analysts’ average forecasts several times this year.Last quarter, Amazon earned 28 cents per share and reported revenue of $127.10 billion, both of which missed analysts’ mean expectations, according to Refinitiv’s data. Amazon also said that it expects to post fourth-quarter revenue of between $140 billion and $148 billion. Analysts, on average, were looking for Q4 sales to come in at $155.15 billion. Amazon also said it expects soft sales during this year’s holiday shopping season despite holding a Prime sales event earlier than normal in October.AMZN stock has declined 45% this year and currently trades at $92 per share. The company’s market capitalization has fallen below $1 trillion, its lowest level in more than two years. A year ago, Amazon had a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion.Cisco Systems (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comCalifornia-based Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has announced plans to lay off more than 4,000 employees, or about 5% of its workforce that numbers 83,000 people worldwide. The company said it plans to end this year with the same number of employees with which it started last January.The telecommunications-equipment maker is reducing staff as it struggles with weak demand and slowing sales. The company said that, going forward, it plans to focus more on its enterprise networking, security, and platform offerings, where it sees the most growth potential. But making the changes and undertaking the layoffs won’t be cheap.Cisco said the restructuring would likely cost it $600 million. The company added that it also plans to reduce the number of office buildings it owns and leases as the shift to remote work becomes permanent in many areas of its operations.The cost cutting comes after  the company reported mixed fiscal first-quarter earnings. Specifically, Cisco announced that its revenue rose 6% year-over-year to $13.6 billion. But, conversely, its net income fell 10% to $2.7 billion. Moreover, the sales of the company’s “Internet for the Future” unit declined 5% to $1.3 billion, while the revenue of its “Other Products” segment plunged 47% YOY. Finally, its Services revenue was essentially flat, coming in at $3.39 billion for the quarter.CSCO stock is down 24% this year at $47.80 per share. The stock trades today at roughly the same level it was at in 2000, just prior to the dotcom bubble bursting.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.
