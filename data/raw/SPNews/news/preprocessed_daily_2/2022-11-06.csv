Yet, here we are in 2022, and autonomous vehicles still feel more science-fiction than they do reality. But that’s all going to change next year. Yes, to date, the Self-Driving Revolution has been nothing but broken promises.  But in 2023, all those promises will actually become a reality. For the first time ever, self-driving cars will appear on roads and highways near you. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt will be a very exciting year. It will also be a very profitable year for prescient investors. As the highly anticipated and long-overdue concept of autonomous vehicles finally becomes a widespread reality, autonomous vehicle stocks will soar. Not by a little – but by a lot. We think some AV stocks could rise 200%-plus next year alone!So, buckle up, and get ready for the (self-driving) ride of a lifetime. Self-Driving Vehicles Are HereFor the first time ever, self-driving vehicles are making their way to Main Street America. In Houston, Domino’s (DPZ) is using small autonomous vehicles to deliver pizzas. Uber Eats is using its own autonomous vehicles to deliver food in Houston and Mountain View. Meanwhile, 7-Eleven is also using self-driving cars to deliver food orders in Silicon Valley.An image of an Uber Eats' Nuro self-driving vehicle parked on the street, a tree and home in the backgroundSource: UberKroger (KR) – America’s largest grocer – uses a fleet of autonomous cars to deliver groceries in Phoenix and Houston. FedEx (FDX) is testing out autonomous trucks in Houston, too. So is IKEA.Meanwhile, the first non-Tesla self-driving cars with full-stack sensor suites are already being produced in China. And in 2023, they’ll start production in the U.S., too.Autonomous vehicles have arrived. To be sure, most of the applications mentioned above deal with the autonomous transportation of goods – not people. But that’s how this all begins.From Goods to PeopleThat is, the AV Revolution starts by testing self-driving technology with the transportation of goods. That’s because the cost of a mistake is only the cost of the goods (not a human life). Then, once proven safe with goods, companies will apply that same technology to human transport.Story continuesThat will happen in 2023. Mark my words. Autonomous vehicles transporting people around major U.S. cities will increasingly become the standard in 2023. Case in point: Google’s Waymo unit announced a few months ago that it’s launching a fully autonomous robo-taxi service in San Francisco.So, forget what all those naysayers are saying about self-driving cars not booming until the 2030s. With every major food and logistics company set to test autonomous delivery and trucking in 2022 – and some major AV players already launching full robo-taxi services – the AV Revolution will go parabolic in 2023. Within years, self-driving trucks and vans will constitute the bulk of the world’s logistics network. And by 2030, self-driving cars will be a ubiquity, transporting not just our goods everywhere – but you and me, too.Of course, the economic implications are huge. We’re talking about a paradigm shift in not just the multi-trillion-dollar transportation market, but a fundamental reshaping of the insurance, healthcare, oil &amp; gas, and tourism industries.In total, the AV Revolution is projected to inject $7 trillion into the global economy each year!The investment opportunity here is enormous.But at this point, the intelligent investor has to be asking: What changed? I mean… autonomous vehicles have, for years, been a mere sci-fi concept with very rare on-road testing. Now they’re ready to take over the world? What happened!?The Millionaire-Maker Tech Behind AVsI’ll tell you what changed: the cost of LiDAR technology.You see; the key to unlocking full autonomy is by enabling cars to have complete “vision.” Specifically, we have to give them a human-like ability to see and respond to their surroundings.Ideally, you want to do this with built-in cameras since they’re space- and cost-efficient on the hardware front.But computer vision (what you get from cameras) has significant limitations that have proven difficult to overcome. Long story short, if the human eye were a camera, it would have more than 100X the resolution of a standard on-car cameras. So for cars to gain a comparable ability to see and respond to their surroundings, you’d need hundreds of cameras on the car.That just isn’t possible. It’d cost thousands of dollars — and result in ugly and bulky cars.The fix? A different type of sensor called LiDAR.LiDAR — short for Light Detection and Ranging — are laser sensors. They beam out lasers to their surroundings. Those beams hit objects around the car and then bounce back to the sensors. And the sensors then carefully measure either the travel time of those laser pulses (time-of-flight or ToF) or a change in frequency of the returning light wave (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave or FMCW) to create a proxy for distance.Do this thousands of times in a 360-degree frame-of-view, and voila. You have a complete and dynamic “picture” of the surrounding environment.The science is crystal clear here. LiDAR fixes the shortcomings of computer vision and cameras. And therefore, LiDAR is the key enabling technology behind the $7 trillion Autonomous Vehicle Revolution.Costly No MoreBut for years, there has been one problem with LiDAR. It has been prohibitively expensive.Less than 10 years ago, your typical LiDAR sensor cost about $75,000. That’s more than double the average sales price of an entire car. At that price, automakers couldn’t integrate the tech into their cars. It would result in a car that no one could buy.But LiDAR costs have collapsed over the past few years.Thanks to improvements in manufacturing capabilities, economies of scale and innovative technological breakthroughs, the cost of LiDAR sensors has plummeted to a point where there are some LiDAR makers out there today that are integrating the technology into vehicles for less than $1,000 per sensor.A graph depicting the price decrease in LiDAR sensors over timeThat’s right. LiDAR costs have plunged from $75,000 to less than $1,000.And at less than $1,000, today’s LiDAR sensors are no longer prohibitively expensive. In fact, they’re quite reasonable. And as a result, they can now be integrated into cars to enable self-driving.No wonder self-driving cars are starting to pop up everywhere…And with the costs of car ownership only rising rapidly — thanks to the Russia-Ukraine war — the economic value proposition of self-driving cars is becoming exponentially more attractive by the day.That’s why we’re pounding on the table about autonomous vehicle stocks. It’s their time to shine — and take over the world. We firmly believe that people who buy the right autonomous vehicle stocks today will make much more than 10X their money over the next few years.The Final Word on Self-Driving CarsMark my words. Thanks to soaring gas and metal prices converging on rapid technological improvements in the field of self-driving, 2022 will go down as the year the AV Revolution really got started.That means it is time to buy autonomous vehicle stocks for huge long-term gains.And what better way to play this $7 trillion revolution than by buying the companies creating the ground-breaking LiDAR technology making it all possible?There is no better way. The best way to play the AV Revolution is to buy LiDAR stocks.Specifically, there is one LiDAR stock out there… trading for less than $5. And it could end up being the stock market’s biggest winner in the 2020s. Seriously. This stock could easily rise 10X, 15X, or 20X within the next few years alone, mostly because its LiDAR could power the world’s most popular electric vehicle by 2030.Find out its name, ticker symbol, and key business details.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post The Long Overdue Self-Driving Revolution Will Arrive Next Year appeared first on InvestorPlace.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$5.5b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 20% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Starbucks. View our latest analysis for Starbucks ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Starbucks?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Starbucks. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Starbucks' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Starbucks. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.4% and 3.9% of the stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of StarbucksThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Starbucks Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$2.2b. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Starbucks better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Starbucks   (of which 2 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Parker-Hannifin's shares before the 10th of November to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.33 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.32 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Parker-Hannifin has a trailing yield of approximately 1.8% on its current stock price of $298.88. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Parker-Hannifin has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Parker-Hannifin paid out a comfortable 48% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 27% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Parker-Hannifin, with earnings per share up 5.8% on average over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. Organisations that reinvest heavily in themselves typically get stronger over time, which can bring attractive benefits such as stronger earnings and dividends.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Parker-Hannifin has increased its dividend at approximately 13% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Parker-Hannifin for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Parker-Hannifin is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Parker-Hannifin is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. We've identified 4 warning signs with Parker-Hannifin (at least 1 which is a bit concerning), and understanding these should be part of your investment process.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest food and beverage companies in the world in 2022.The biggest food and beverage companies in the world in 2022 are mostly full of household names. The global food and beverage industry is worth trillions of dollars and grew from $5,818 billion in 2021 to jump to $6,327 billion in 2022 at a very decent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. Despite facing several issues which we'll discuss in a moment, the industry is expected to grow to $7,942 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 5.8% according to the Business Research Company.The food and beverage sector was quite badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic which engulfed the world in 2020. Most restaurants and bars were closed immediately and were among the last to open after restrictions were ended in most countries. Furthermore, the global supply chain was significantly affected as well, affecting the operations of most major corporations and especially those with international operations. According to a report by Deloitte, food and beverage companies faced lower consumptions during the pandemic even as at-home consumption increased, which typically has lower margins. Even though out of home consumption has now increased, it is still not at levels before the pandemic as many potential customers now prefer at-home consumption mainly for comfort reasons.Largest Food and Beverage Companies in the World in 2022Copyright: stockbroker / 123RF Stock PhotoWhile recovery from the pandemic loomed in early 2021, the Russia-Ukraine war turned everything on its head. The war has resulted in a lot of sanctions imposed by mainly the West has resulted in the prices of commodities soaring which has resulted in higher costs for the food and beverage industry. The supply chain has also faced disruption because of the war which has also resulted in uneven supply and higher costs. Further, inflation has soared globally with many countries facing record levels of soaring prices, which has reduced disposable income and hence, spending on food and beverages.Story continuesTo determine the biggest food and beverage companies in the world in 2022, we referred to Forbes Global 2000 list and isolated those companies which are part of the food and beverage industry. We have only considered public companies because while there are companies such as Mars Wrigley which is a massive company, there is no information available as the company does not issue annual reports and of course, does not have a market cap. We considered three criteria namely revenue, market cap, profits and assets, with 30% weightage each assigned to the first three criteria and 10% to the last one. For market cap, we checked each company's latest market cap on Yahoo Finance and used it to base our rankings on.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest airlines in the world in 2022.Since 2020, you cannot discuss the airline industry without considering the impact of the pandemic, which didn't just devastate the industry for the last 2 years, but also has changed its trajectory for the future. Before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the world was connected more than ever before, and airlines played a huge part, with more routes than ever before allowing people to travel easily to wherever they want at an affordable cost.However, once the pandemic hit, most countries across the globe went into lockdown, with initially both domestic and international travel being suspended, before lifting the suspension for the former after a few months. For several months at a time, multiple times a year, people were confined to their own homes, and travelling by plane in a closed space with over a hundred other people was almost unfathomable. The devastation this wreaked on the airline industry cannot be understated; the industry's 2020 revenues were around 40% of the total revenues of 2019.While it seems that the pandemic has mostly subsided, at least in most countries with pandemic restrictions being lifted, the impact of the last two years has changed the industry forever, in multiple ways. For example, the airline industry, and the biggest airlines in the world in 2022 in particular, have increased hygiene and safety standards to ensure the comfort of passengers while digitization has increased massively as well. While many digitized options, such as online check-in and seat selection, had been introduced well before the pandemic, they are now the go-to choice for many passengers in a bit to reduce human contact and increase efficiency.Largest Airlines in the World in 2022The modus operandi of many airlines is to provide cheap seats in economy class with low margins and subsidize that by overcharging for business class. Business class is generally used by either extremely rich people, or corporations for business trips, with many companies instituting policies of business class travel being permitted if the total flight duration meets a certain threshold. However, while leisure travel is expected to rebound faster, the same cannot be said for the business segment, as most employees prefer working remotely, being able to easily connect with a vast array of digital tools. According to McKinsey, even in 2024, business travel will only be at 80% of pre-pandemic levels. History backs this belief as well; business travel took much longer to recover after 9/11 and also after the financial crash. In fact, business travel had still not recovered to pre-financial crash levels before the pandemic occurred. Meanwhile, leisure trips have historically rebounded faster and considering the travel fiasco in 2022, that still holds true.Story continuesSince leisure trips have rebounded faster, that is the area that airlines have targeted to decrease their losses, and in some cases, even register profits. When business declined drastically in the past 2 years, most airlines and major airports reduced their staff significantly, with companies laying off or furloughing tens of thousands of employees at a time in an effort to combat mounting losses. When travel returned to normal, or almost normal, in the summer of 2022, some airlines and most airports in Europe and the United States were understaffed significantly, and unable to handle the traffic. This is why it was probably the worst time to be a passenger. Many airlines, especially in the United States, posted a record Q2, though this revenue was driven by exorbitantly high tickets rather than an increase in passengers (the amount passengers paid per mile in the big four US airlines was 19.3% higher than in the same quarter in 2019). While passenger numbers have swelled majorly in 2022, they are still short of pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, airports weren't properly staffed or ready in time, resulting in chaotic pictures of queues of hundreds of people, baggage strewn everywhere due to a lack of baggage handlers and passengers being told to arrive several hours ahead of their flight in order to avoid any potential delays. This even led to spats between airlines and airports, with the biggest one being between Emirates and Heathrow Airport when the latter instituted a 100,000 passengers per day limit, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights.According to the International Air Transport Association, profitability is within reach of the global industry in 2023 driven by strong demand and higher prices. Flights in 2022 are already expected to be at 87% of 2019 levels, which is a major rebound, and unless the pandemic makes a comeback or a global recession chokes off the recovery, this will continue growing, with expected global revenues of $782 billion in 2023, 93.3% of 2019 levels.Ranking the biggest airlines in the world in 2022 was not an easy task. There are several ways to rank airlines but most of the information found when searching for the biggest airlines is either unsourced or outdated. Sometimes, it's just impractical such as defining the biggest airlines by number of seats available, when there are far better metrics to consider. For our rankings, we considered the latest revenues of each airline, as well as the number of employees, assigning 70% to the former and 30% to the latter. We also considered market value; however, some of the biggest Middle Eastern airlines aren't listed, and excluding them would lead to a major inaccuracy in the rankings. All the information for revenue and employees is either taken from Fortune 500, each company's annual reports or their official website. So, let's take a look at the kings of the sky, starting with number 15:15. JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU)Total revenue in the latest financial year (in billions of dollars): 6.04Total number of employees: 17,459JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) is an American low cost carrier, and operates more than 1,000 flights daily.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest companies headquartered in Ireland.The third-largest island in Europe, Ireland boasts a highly developed knowledge which is focused on financial services, life sciences, high-tech and agribusiness. Considered to be an open economy, Ireland ranks top in the world for high-value foreign direct investment while in terms of GDP per capita, it ranks 4th in lists compiled by the International Monetary Fund as well as the the World Bank. All of this is even more impressive considering the fact that after consistent growth for 23 years, Ireland was badly affected by the global 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the Irish property bubble, which resulted in the country entering a recession.Largest Companies Headquartered in IrelandJames Kennedy NI/Shutterstock.comIreland's economy finally rebounded in 2011, growing by 2.2%, followed by 0.2% in 2012, before plunging into another crisis driven by the European sovereign-debt crisis before rebounding again. There have been accusations that Ireland's economic growth is distorted due to Ireland having favorable corporate tax regimes which has led to many major foreign companies merging with companies in Ireland and moving their headquarters to the company to take advantage of the aforesaid corporate tax regime. Mainly companies in the United States have decided to move their headquarters to Ireland starting with Accenture in 2009. To a lesser extent, the United Kingdom also has had companies moving their headquarters to Ireland. This has also been dubbed as ""leprechaun economics"" by economists while a few multinationals including the Central Bank of Ireland have proposed alternative methods of calculation. These moves, especially for companies in the United States have said to have reduced the effective tax rate on corporations from 30% to 20% while these corporations have highly artificially inflated the GDP of the country.Story continuesTo determine the largest companies headquartered in Ireland, we headed over to Forbes Global 2000 list for 2022 and filtered out companies in Ireland. We then ranked these companies based on revenue, profits, assets and market value as of 29th October 2022. We then assigned 30% weightage to revenue, profits and market value, assigning 10% weightage to assets. This has allowed us to create a more accurate ranking.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Amgen share price has climbed 56% in five years, easily topping the market return of 39% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 30% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Amgen In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Amgen achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.8% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Amgen's TSR for the last 5 years was 81%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Amgen has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 30% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The global food and beverage industry is worth trillions of dollars and grew from $5,818 billion in 2021 to jump to $6,327 billion in 2022 at a very decent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. Despite facing several issues which we'll discuss in a moment, the industry is expected to grow to $7,942 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 5.8% according to the Business Research Company.The food and beverage sector was quite badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic which engulfed the world in 2020. Most restaurants and bars were closed immediately and were among the last to open after restrictions were ended in most countries. Furthermore, the global supply chain was significantly affected as well, affecting the operations of most major corporations and especially those with international operations. According to a report by Deloitte, food and beverage companies faced lower consumptions during the pandemic even as at-home consumption increased, which typically has lower margins. Even though out of home consumption has now increased, it is still not at levels before the pandemic as many potential customers now prefer at-home consumption mainly for comfort reasons.Largest Food and Beverage Companies in the World in 2022Copyright: stockbroker / 123RF Stock PhotoWhile recovery from the pandemic loomed in early 2021, the Russia-Ukraine war turned everything on its head. The war has resulted in a lot of sanctions imposed by mainly the West has resulted in the prices of commodities soaring which has resulted in higher costs for the food and beverage industry. The supply chain has also faced disruption because of the war which has also resulted in uneven supply and higher costs. Further, inflation has soared globally with many countries facing record levels of soaring prices, which has reduced disposable income and hence, spending on food and beverages.Story continuesTo determine the biggest food and beverage companies in the world in 2022, we referred to Forbes Global 2000 list and isolated those companies which are part of the food and beverage industry. We have only considered public companies because while there are companies such as Mars Wrigley which is a massive company, there is no information available as the company does not issue annual reports and of course, does not have a market cap. We considered three criteria namely revenue, market cap, profits and assets, with 30% weightage each assigned to the first three criteria and 10% to the last one. For market cap, we checked each company's latest market cap on Yahoo Finance and used it to base our rankings on.

In fact, over the last 12 months, the Nasdaq Composite Index has dropped more than 35%. This isn’t surprising, given the more growth-oriented nature of stocks listed on this exchange. Growth stocks are far more sensitive to interest rate increases, hence these types of stocks have been more greatly affected by the steep rise in interest rates this year.In addition, as the Federal Reserve continues to hike rates, in its efforts to bring inflation under control, Nasdaq-listed equities may be in for further volatility. However, while that suggests holding off on popular tech and other growth names listed on the exchange, there are some Nasdaq Composite components you may want to consider.For example, these seven Nasdaq stocks, all of which currently trade within 10% of their respective 52-week lows. Already pushed to favorable valuations, each one could be in for a rebound, even if an overall Nasdaq rebound takes time to happen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCMECME Group$170.44FOXFox. Corp.$27.58POOLPool Corp.$287.84QCOMQualcomm$105.97RILYB. Riley Financial$43.28SBGISinclair Broadcast Group$16.88SSRMSSR Mining$13.80CME Group (CME)Nasdaq 100 stocks: the Nasdaq building lit up at nightSource: ShutterstockCME Group (NASDAQ:CME) is the world’s largest commodities futures exchange operators.Despite strengths like high margins and a deep economic moat, CME stock has been knocked lower during the market downturn. The stock is down over 21% since last Nov. So, as one of the Nasdaq stocks hitting a new 52-week low, what makes it a buy today? It’s possible that the market is overreacting to the prospect of a slowdown in trading volume on CME’s exchange, after the big run-up in commodities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The CME continues to exceed expectations in terms of trading volume, revenue, and earnings. This may mean shares, trading for a reasonable 20.96 times forward earnings, are oversold. CME stock also sports a 2.31% forward dividend yield, with an 11-year track record of dividend growth.Story continuesFox Corporation (FOX)Businessman is drawing a growing virtual hologram stock bar chart on dark blue background representing value stocksSource: Costello77 / ShutterstockConsisting of the media properties not included in 21st Century Fox’s sale to Disney (NYSE:DIS), Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) delivered middling returns since it debuted as a separate, publicly-traded company in 2019.FOX stock has been under even more pressure recently, due to another possible merger move. That is, the Murdoch family is looking to re-merge Fox with News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS). News Corp, spun off of Fox’s former parent company in 2013, consists of print media properties such as The Wall Street Journal.But while the market today isn’t too keen on the proposed deal, this deal could ultimately pay off for FOX stock investors. Mostly, through cost synergies stemming from consolidating the news operations of both entities. These cost savings, plus continued growth of Fox’s video streaming business (Tubi TV), could help this cheap stock (trading for only 8.14 times earnings) make a comeback.Pool Corp. (POOL)Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming poolSource: ShutterstockPool Corp. (NASDAQ:POOL) is a distributor of swimming pool chemicals, equipment, and supplies. Although operating results continue to exceed expectations, it is Pool’s future that’s weighing on the minds of investors. For example, concerns about the impact of a recession has pushed the POOL stock to a new 52-week low. Yet while the sell-side expects Pool Corporation’s earnings to decline in 2023, you may want to “buy the dip,” as it were.That’s because the POOL stock could continue to be a long-term winner. As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth argued last month, Pool’s business may be more resilient than the market currently believes. This may enable the stock to remain a top-performing S&amp;P 500 component. Pool shares are also a great dividend growth play. Although the current dividend yield (1.31%) is low, payouts have grown by an average of 21.5% over the past five years.Qualcomm (QCOM)a big pile of smartphonesSource: ShutterstockUnderwhelming guidance pushed Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to a new multi year low. Shares in the mobile chip maker now trade at their lowest prices in more than two years. There’s now high uncertainty regarding results in the coming quarters, as the global economic slowdown affects mobile chip demand.At first glance, this news, and the subsequent reaction, may signal that it’s best to steer clear of QCOM stock. However, based on the latest sell-side analyst ratings, the prospect of what Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is calling a “temporary cyclical inventory drawdown” isn’t a reason to stay away.Analysts from Canaccord Genuity, Piper Sandler, and KeyBanc have all maintained “buy” or equivalent ratings on QCOM. Although they’ve each slashed their respective price targets,  each of these targets are well above QCOM’s current highly-discounted (10 times earnings) valuation.B. Riley Financial (RILY)A person holds a phone with a stock chart visible on it with another chart visible on a computer nearby.Source: Bro Crock / Shutterstock.comThe market downturn pushed investment bank B. Riley Financial’s (NASDAQ:RILY) shares down nearly 50% in the past year. A bear market could continue to affect the firm’s operating performance. However, while the market bails out of the stock, B. Riley’s management is seizing the opportunity.As InvestorPlace’s Thomas Yeung pointed out last month, insiders such as founder Bryant Riley are making big purchases of RILY stock. The firm itself has announced plans to buy back up to $50 million in shares over the next year. In hindsight, this snapping up of shares could prove to be a shrewd move.After getting through today’s rough patch, RILY could make a big recovery. Better yet, one can buy this stock today, and get paid to wait for said comeback. RILY currently pays out $4 per share in dividends, making this one of the high-yield (10%) Nasdaq stocks.Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI)graphs and stock charts are superimposed on a stock image of a businessmanSource: ShutterstockSinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) is one of largest owners of broadcast television stations in the U.S., owning and/or operating 185 TV stations in 86 media markets. The company also owns several “diginets,” or digital broadcast subchannels, as well as a 50% interest in a joint venture that operates regional sports channels under the Bally Sports brand.Negative sentiment, made worse by a recent downgrade from Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall, has pushed SBGI stock to a new 52-week low. Cahall’s bearishness is based largely on an expected drop in net retransmission revenue from cable operators.Yet based on Sinclair’s Oct. 2022 investor presentation, factors such as increased political advertising on its stations could make up for this. Also, like peer Nexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST), the launch of NEXTGEN TV, aka ATSC 3.0, could open new opportunities for Sinclair to further monetize its broadcast spectrum assets.SSR Mining (SSRM)Mining cart in a silver, copper, and gold mine representing VOXR Stock.Source: TTstudio / ShutterstockSSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM) mines for gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc at projects located in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, and Turkey.Trading at a reasonable 13.4 times forward earnings, the SSRM stock may be a great way to add precious metals exposure to your portfolio. Even as precious metal prices remain in a slump, silver and gold prices could start to bounce back, once the Fed ends its current tightening cycle. If the Fed pivots, and cuts rates down the road, precious metals could zoom higher.Also, as a Seeking Alpha contributor argued last month, the resumption of operations at its Çöpler gold mine in Turkey points to stronger results going forward. With all this in mind, consider snapping up SSRM, while it remains one of the Nasdaq stocks near its 52-week low.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

In contrast individual stocks will provide a wide range of possible returns, and may fall short. That's what happened in the case of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT): its share price dropped 31% while the market declined 25%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 21% in three years.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Medtronic share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 35%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.It's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Revenue was pretty flat on last year, which isn't too bad. However, it is certainly possible the market was expecting an uptick in revenue, and that the share price fall reflects that disappointment.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 25% in the twelve months, Medtronic shareholders did even worse, losing 29% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

(NYSE:ROK) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-know-rockwell-automation-120207471.html,1667736127,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Rockwell Automation's shares before the 10th of November to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.18 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.72 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Rockwell Automation has a trailing yield of approximately 1.9% on its current stock price of $247.43. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Rockwell Automation paid out 56% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 76% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Rockwell Automation earnings per share are up 4.7% per annum over the last five years. A payout ratio of 56% looks like a tacit signal from management that reinvestment opportunities in the business are low. In line with limited earnings growth in recent years, this is not the most appealing combination.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Rockwell Automation has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Rockwell Automation worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and Rockwell Automation paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Rockwell Automation from a dividend perspective.So if you want to do more digging on Rockwell Automation, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Rockwell Automation and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

25,86d60f84-e8bc-3575-88e5-e0566bd417e3,BA,2022-11-06,UPDATE 2-China 'reheats' $17 bln Airbus deals during Scholz visit,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-china-reheats-17-bln-102519119.html,1667557519,STORY,"['AIR.PA', 'EADSY', 'BA']","[(Recasts, adds details, quotes)By Albee Zhang, Tim Hepher and Eduardo BaptistaBEIJING/PARIS, Nov 4 (Reuters) - China on Friday formally announced existing deals for Airbus jets worth $17 billion, in what experts described as an effort to showcase a visit by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that caught the European planemaker and China-watchers off guard.China's state buying agency CASC said it had signed a bulk agreement for 140 Airbus aircraft including 132 A320-family jets and eight A350 wide-body aircraft during Scholz's one-day visit.However, the timing triggered speculation as an Airbus spokesperson said it covered deals already on its books including part of a 292-jet deal in July, and an industry source familiar with the matter said the A350 deal went back to 2019.""China's modus operandi is to announce business deals commensurate with the importance of the guest,"" said Noah Barkin, managing editor with research firm Rhodium Group's China practice and an expert in German-Chinese relations.""Germany was not keen to make this about deals. So the Chinese side appears to have reheated an old deal and announced it on their own.""CASC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The announcement comes as Beijing is widely seen as keen to show concrete achievements from the visit, which has stirred concerns in Germany that Berlin will prioritise economic ties with Beijing over security and strategic matters.China is Germany's biggest trading partner and Scholz decided to take a large business delegation with him to the dismay of China hawks in the West.In the face of growing criticism, a German official said ahead of the visit no deals would be signed during it.Scholz told journalists in Beijing late on Friday he had campaigned for a level playing field for European and Chinese companies during his trip, but did not mention an Airbus deal.'DIPLOMATIC SIGNALS'Experts said the discrepancy between the narrative from Beijing and the reaction in Europe highlighted the importance of the Scholz visit in the eyes of the Chinese leadership.Story continuesThe German Chancellor's in-person meeting with Xi marked the end of a three-year period where Xi did not interact face-to-face with any leader of a G7 nation.The aircraft announcement also marked an apparent signal to the United States where Boeing remains largely frozen out of the Chinese market after several years of trade tensions.China's ""Big Three"" state airlines in July pledged to buy a total of 292 Airbus jets, making it the biggest order at the time by Chinese carriers for several years and a breakthrough for Europe.Airbus officially booked the deal in August.Boeing acknowledged on Wednesday it may have to do without the world's largest import market as it strives to raise output and reach delivery targets in the wake of a safety crisis.""China has long used jet deals to send diplomatic signals, rewards friendships and punish critics,"" said a veteran Western watcher of China's aviation industry, asking not to be named.Friday's announcement covered 132 out of the 292 single-aisle jets purchased from Airbus earlier this year.Industry sources said that amounted to a carrot for remaining orders to receive the same fanfare during any future trip by French President Emmanuel Macron.

26,ec5b5f10-0bb6-3643-af64-089b9de88340,SO,2022-11-06,The Southern Company's (NYSE:SO) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 88% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-companys-nyse-intrinsic-value-110040843.html,1667732440,STORY,['SO'],"[Does the November share price for The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Southern Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$598.0mUS$850.5mUS$1.41bUS$2.62bUS$3.65bUS$4.68bUS$5.63bUS$6.46bUS$7.16bUS$7.76bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 39.29%Est @ 28.1%Est @ 20.26%Est @ 14.78%Est @ 10.94%Est @ 8.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% -US$564US$756US$1.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.7kUS$3.3kUS$3.7kUS$4.0kUS$4.2kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$193bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$193b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$107bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$132b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$64.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Southern as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Southern, we've put together three relevant aspects you should assess:Risks: You should be aware of the 3 warning signs for Southern (1 is significant!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does SO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

He clarified that the program is not an attempt to steer clients to Wells Fargo, but toward micro-lending programs or Small Business Administration financing.The Inclusivity Project, which has serviced over 2,000 business owners and entrepreneurs, was launched in early 2021 after Black and African American businesses were hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic.]"

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. Its return of 77% has certainly bested the market return! While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 16% drop, in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for CSX There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, CSX achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on CSX's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, CSX's TSR for the last 5 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that CSX shares lost 15% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand CSX better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with CSX , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.CSX is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

No, this is not a popular topic by any means, usually arousing anger among the investing faithful. However, everyone must realize that when it comes to money, it’s best to look out for number one. And if that means dumping shares, so be it.To lessen the possible guilt associated with targeting stocks to sell, the matter has been forced out of our hands. With the Federal Reserve committed to its hawkish monetary policy, risk-on names suffer disproportionately due to higher borrowing costs. In turn, this dynamic limits business activity, often leading to sharp market losses. Frankly, you want to be ahead of the crowd in this exercise.To navigate this sensitive topic, I used Gurufocus.com to extract some of the worst offenders among stocks to sell. This way, we’re largely dealing with an objective assessment based on hard numbers and little else. So, if you’re ready, here are the stocks to sell before the year ends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRCLRoyal Caribbean$54.75GOLGol Intelligent Airlines$4.00SRNESorrento Therapeutics$1.52HRTXHeron Therapeutics$3.41ARECAmerican Resources$1.71MARKRemark Holdings$0.27AIUMeta Data$1.09Royal Caribbean (RCL)cruise stocks docked cruise ships. CCL stock.Source: Kokoulina / Shutterstock.comA famous global cruise ship holding company, Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) has been one of the hardest-hit companies during the coronavirus pandemic. With few people willing to be around complete strangers in tight quarters, Royal and its ilk became victims of circumstance. Unfortunately, even with the return to normal, RCL never quite gained momentum. On a year-to-date basis, RCL dropped over 33% of its equity value.To be fair, Royal Caribbean shares gained nearly 23% in the trailing month. Much of the enthusiasm centered on the company’s third-quarter earnings report, where it beat the consensus earnings estimate. However, management also reported disappointing guidance for the current quarter. For those that take a holistic view of their investments, they might want to heed Gurufocus.com’s warning: RCL may represent a value trap.Story continuesWhile certain metrics like its forward price-earnings ratio coming in below the industry median seem attractive, both sales and earnings projections are poor. Plus, the company features a weak balance sheet. Notably, its Altman Z-Score is 0.26 below parity, reflecting high bankruptcy risk in the next two years.Gol Intelligent Airlines (GOL)a picture of an airplane flying with the sun in the background. Airline Stocks to Buy and HoldSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Gol Intelligent Airlines (NYSE:GOL) is a low-cost carrier. Like the cruise ship operator industry, the airlines suffered disproportionately during the initial onset of the Covid-19 crisis. During the recovery process, certain companies performed better than others. Unfortunately, GOL hasn’t been able to gain much positive traction. Since the start of the year, shares fell nearly 36%.On the surface, certain valuation metrics seem to point positively for Gol Intelligent. For instance, the company’s price-to-sales ratio is 0.33 times, far below the transportation industry’s median of 1.02. However, the enterprise’s growth and earnings trajectories are suspect. Mainly, revenue growth on a per-share basis and profitability margins ping well below breakeven.In addition, the company’s balance sheet raises significant questions. For instance, its Altman Z-Score slipped 2.31 points below parity, reflecting substantial distress and bankruptcy risk. Also, Gol’s cash-to-debt ratio is only 0.02 times, extremely low for the industry. Sadly, then, GOL represents one of the stocks to sell.Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE)An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around itSource: ra2 studio/ShutterstockA biotechnology firm, Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRNE) garnered much popularity during the early phase of the new normal. Primarily an oncology specialist, Sorrento made a hard pivot to Covid-19, developing both treatment alternatives and vaccines. Unfortunately, fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus faded and subsequently so too did SRNE’s bullish narrative. Shares fell nearly 70% YTD.While it might be tempting to pick up shares on “discount,” the reality may be that SRNE is one of the stocks to sell. Frankly, its financial prospects leave much to be desired. For instance, in Q2 2022, Sorrento suffered declines in revenue and expansions of net losses on a year-over-year basis. More critically, investors may take a dim view of the massive share dilution that occurred between the start of the new normal till now.Aside from that, Sorrento features other red flags associated with stocks to sell. Primarily, the company features a weak balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 5.5 below parity. Again, this reading indicates significant distress and bankruptcy risk over the next two years.Heron Therapeutics (HRTX)Phot of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effectSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageAnother biotechnology firm, Heron Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HRTX) seeks to improve the lives of patients by developing novel, best-in-class treatments to address some of the most important unmet patient needs, per its website. Though a noble pursuit, the harsh reality is that Wall Street isn’t giving HRTX much of a chance. Since the start of the year, HRTX stock slipped 66%.Unlike some other stocks to sell, Heron doesn’t enjoy the excuse of pointing to positive near-term momentum. Instead, over the trailing month, HRTX fell a worrying 28%. One of the biggest issues with the underlying company centers on stability (or lack thereof). For instance, its cash-to-debt ratio is only 0.53 times, below nearly 89% of its peers.Further, the company suffers from declining sales trends. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis sits 6% below parity. That’s worse than 61% of the underlying sector. Combined with negative operating and net margins, HRTX easily ranks among the stocks to sell.American Resources (AREC)a lithium ion batterySource: Olivier Le Moal/ShutterStock.comBilled as a next-generation, socially responsible, supplier of raw materials, American Resources (NASDAQ:AREC) focuses on the new infrastructure and electrification market. Per its website, the company’s products go to produce steel, alloys, and lithium-ion batteries, among other applications. However, the Street doesn’t give much of a chance for AREC, with shares sliding over 17% YTD.Fundamentally, American Resources appears like a major value trap, according to data from Gurufocus.com. Yes, AREC trades at 5.3 times forward earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 5.8 times, suggesting a somewhat undervalued proposition. However, both its revenue growth rate on a per-share basis and its net margin ping deeply below breakeven. Therefore, under an environment of monetary tightening, circumstances appear unfavorable for AREC.Also, American Resources suffers from poor fiscal stability. For instance, the company’s Altman Z-Score is 5.8 points below parity, reflecting strong bankruptcy risk. Also, its cash-to-debt ratio is middling for the industry. With headwinds rising, it’s time to consider AREC as one of the stocks to sell.Remark Holdings (MARK)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solutionSource: ShutterstockAccording to its website, Remark Holdings (NASDAQ:MARK) is a global leader in video analytics with one of the most intelligent, reliable, and fast artificial intelligence platforms. The company gained a cult following of sorts during the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. However, at the moment, it’s one of the stocks to sell, with shares trading hands at only 27 cents a pop. Since the beginning of the year, MARK hemorrhaged over 74% of its equity value.From a technical perspective, MARK appears to be dead money. In the trailing month, shares lost about 8.5%. Fundamentally, several red flags have sprouted. Perhaps most notably, the balance sheet is a mess. For example, Remark’s Altman Z-Score fell nearly 15 points below parity, signifying a deeply distressed business. As well, its equity-to-asset ratio of 0.19 times below breakeven ranks worse than 95% of the underlying industry.Not surprisingly, the company features red ink on both its three-year revenue growth rate and net margin. With forward prospects dimming, it’s best to consider MARK as one of the stocks to sell.Meta Data (AIU)text books on a desk with a chalkboard in the backgroundSource: ShutterstockBased in China, Meta Data (NYSE:AIU) offers education services. Specifically, it provides after-school learning programs for students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Meta Data also offers one-to-one education, examination question analysis, mistakes settlement, tutoring, culture programs, and other services. However, investors see very little value in AIU stock, sending shares down over 84% YTD.Presently, shares trade hands at only 8 cents above a buck. However, if circumstances continue to worsen, AIU could be a literal penny stock in no time. Fundamentally, Meta Data is deeply distressed. On its balance sheet, the company’s Altman Z-Score sits over 57 points below parity. Frankly, that’s an unheard-of level of instability, suggesting that AIU is easily one of the stocks to sell.Other factors to monitor include its three-year revenue growth on a per-share basis slipping into negative territory. The same can be said about its operating and net margins. Honestly, it’s probably best not to play hero and just let this one go.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

Check out our latest analysis for Visa While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Visa managed to grow its earnings per share at 23% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Visa, it has a TSR of 82% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Visa shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 8.4% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals.

40,c6dec758-6de9-3f6e-b8f4-64217988008a,APH,2022-11-06,7 Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Market Blasts Higher in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-tech-stocks-buy-market-162653615.html,1667579213,STORY,"['ACN', 'MSFT', 'TSM', 'ASML', 'APH', 'AMAT']","[A number of catastrophic headwinds imposed significant volatility, especially for popular tech stocks to buy. Primarily, the dovish monetary policies of the past came to roost this year, sending inflation skyrocketing. Now, the Federal Reserve must unwind prior excesses, resulting in a decline in money stock.Depending on how far the central bank wants to go, the environment moving forward could be deflationary in nature. Because many tech stocks to buy receive support from dovish policies, a hawkish ecosystem presents significant challenges, hence their losses. Still, it’s also important to remember that the tech space undergirds myriad innovations. Therefore, the sector may not be deflated indefinitely.To advantage what could be an incredible discount at this juncture, I used Gurufocus.com to extract relatively low-risk ideas that the market either undervalues or ignores. While these names require some patience and tolerance for volatility, it may be worth checking out for potentially large gains. With that, here are seven tech stocks to buy before the market blasts higher next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMSFTMicrosoft$216.61TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$61.79ASMLASML.$457.80ACNAccenture$258.44AMATApplied Materials$90.06APHAmphenol$74.81LOGILogitech$50.21Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest consumer technology firms in the world, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) essentially owns the business world. For instance, the company dominates the desktop operating system segment, commanding around 76% market share. In other words, if you don’t know your way around Microsoft applications, it’s going to be a long day in the office.However, the market can’t seem to run fast enough away from tech stocks to buy, even the established stalwarts. Therefore, MSFT shares slipped 36% on a year-to-date basis. As well, circumstances look rough in the immediate picture, with MSFT losing 14% of equity value in the trailing month. Nevertheless, for those that have a longer-term perspective, the red ink represents a viable discount.Story continuesFinancially, Microsoft is a profitability machine. For instance, its net margin of over 34% ranks better than nearly 97% of the industry. Moreover, Microsoft features a return on equity (ROE) of almost 43%, exceeding the levels printed by 96% of its peers. This reading also signifies that Microsoft represents a very high-quality business. Thus, MSFT easily ranks among the tech stocks to buy.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)a close up image of a semiconductorSource: ShutterstockBased in its namesake country, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is a semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. Per its public profile, TSM is the world’s most valuable semiconductor company, the world’s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry and one of Taiwan’s largest companies. Unfortunately, these stats don’t impress Wall Street much, with shares dropping over 53% YTD.Still, astute investors will be wise to ignore the noise and consider building a position. For one thing, Taiwan Semiconductor is significantly undervalued, according to Gurufocus.com. Using traditional metrics, TSM trades for 10.6 times forward earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 15 times forward earnings.Like Microsoft above, Taiwan Semiconductor truly comes alive on the bottom line. The company’s net margin stands at 40.6%, ranking higher than over 97% of the competition. Also, its ROE and return on asset (ROA) rate within the top 10% of the industry, reflecting tremendous business quality. Fundamentally, then, TSM is a no-brainer among tech stocks to buy.ASML (ASML)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockAn advanced semiconductor specialist, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) specifically focuses on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Per CNBC, ASML is one of a kind, the only company manufacturing the $200 million machines to print every advanced microchip. This fact alone suggests investors should consider ASML as one of the tech stocks to buy.However, Wall Street apparently would rather focus on the sector’s challenges. Since the beginning of the year, ASML gave up nearly 45% of equity value. To me, this selloff seems overly harsh considering the company’s unique offerings. Moreover, Gurufocus.com rates ASML as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations.More importantly, ASML represents a high-quality business. Both its ROE and ROA rank among the sector’s top echelon. On the top line, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20.9% beating out over 76% of its rivals. Plus, during the same period, ASML’s free cash flow (FCF) growth rate pinged at 61%, better than over 85% of the industry. Basically, the business is too strong and unique to ignore.Accenture (ACN)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) specializes in information technology services and consulting. While one of the top beneficiaries of the new normal, ACN shares peaked in late 2021. Unfortunately, this creates an unfavorable backdrop for technical comparisons. Since the beginning of the year, Accenture dropped 37% of equity value.However, ACN makes a case for tech stocks to buy based on its combination of strong margins and fiscal stability. For the former category, Accenture’s operating margin stands at 15.2%, ranked higher than nearly 83% of its peers. Also, its net margin is 11.2%, beating out 79% of the competition. Finally, relating to the income statement, Accenture’s ROE came out to 33%, signifying a very high-quality business.On the stability front, the company features an Altman Z-Score of 6.8. This puts the overall business in the safe zone, meaning that it has low risk of bankruptcy. For a lesser-appreciated name among tech stocks to buy on the dip, ACN brings much to the table.Applied Materials (AMAT)light bulb on abstract technology backgroundSource: Thitichaya Yajampa / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) bills itself as the leader materials engineering solutions used to produce virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world. Though one of the most fundamentally significant tech stocks to buy, the Street has a dim view on AMAT. Since the Jan. opener, shares stumbled and gave up 46% of equity value.To be fair, the volatility isn’t entirely undeserved. For instance, Applied Materials “cut its current-quarter sales and earnings guidance, saying that new export regulations for U.S. semiconductor technology sold in China will weigh on results,” per MarketWatch. While it’s a major distraction, it also opens up a compelling discounted opportunity.Primarily, the company generates excellent profitability margins. For example, its net margin is 26.4%, ranked better than 88% of its rivals. Further, the strength of its financials helped spark a ROE of 55.5% and ROA of 26%. Both stats rank among the top tier of the semiconductor industry, making AMAT an attractive idea for tech stocks to buy.Amphenol (APH)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockBased in Connecticut, Amphenol (NYSE:APH) is one of the lesser-known names among tech stocks to buy. Per its corporate profile, Amphenol is a major producer of electronic and fiber optic connectors, cable and interconnect systems such as coaxial cables. Despite its under-the-radar nature, the Street hasn’t taken much of a liking to the enterprise. Since the start of the year, APH declined by 14%.Nevertheless, Amphenol may be worth checking out for contrarian market participants. Financially, the company drives home strong stats regarding the income statement. In addition, it’s a stable entity. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate hit 9.8%, better than 69% of its peers. Its net margin is 15%, above 87% of the underlying sector. Plus, its ROE is 29%, reflecting a very high-quality business.On the balance sheet, Amphenol features an Altman Z-Score of 5.24, putting the enterprise in the safe zone. Moving ahead in unchartered economic waters, this stability could command a premium.Logitech (LOGI)Two receivers for wireless Logitech (LOGI) devices, plugged into a laptop computer.Source: Somphop Krittayaworagul / Shutterstock.comSpecializing in computer peripheral equipment, Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) represents a dual threat within tech stocks to buy, catering to both business and entertainment demand. From keyboards to contoured mice to video game controllers, Logitech is a vital cog in how people interact with their various machines. Still, the market hasn’t been too thrilled with LOGI, sending shares down over 43% so far this year.However, this negative dynamic could be due for a turnaround. Recently, Reuters reported that Logitech “reported better-than-expected profit during its latest quarter and stuck to its full-year guidance.” Prior to the disclosure, analysts worried that headwinds such as tough comparisons, a strong dollar and fragile consumer confidence would derail Logitech’s financial results. Fortunately, the red wave never materialized.Moving forward, investors can have confidence in LOGI because of its broader relevance. As society fully returns to normal, demand for its computer peripherals should rise. Also, Logitech can handle some economic storms, based on its strong cash-to-debt ratio of nearly 11 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

They would have to rise by more than 200,000 bags though,"" said a Europe-based trader at a global trade house.Certified stocks are a strong driver of ICE coffee prices because, unlike other factors, they are visible to all on a daily basis and many algorithmic funds are pre-programmed to buy when they fall and sell when they rise.The coffee crop in Brazil, responsible for around 40% of global arabica production, could grow by as much as 10% in 2023 due to favourable weather in recent months, analysts say.Story continuesThat should push prices for exchange-grade Brazilian coffee, known as 'semi-washed', down to levels where it becomes economical to deliver the beans to ICE - a market of last resort at times when there is excess supply.Traders said physical prices for Brazilian semi-washed coffee dipped in September to levels where exchange deliveries became economical, but the fall was short-lived, hence just 250,000 bags are at or heading to exchange depots to be certified this year.Next year, those numbers could swell if the favourable weather in Brazil holds up and demand remains depressed due to the economic downturn.""Demand is very, very quiet. No one wants to buy, roasters are stepping out the market. Whoever (has) coffee wants to get out so the only natural buyer is (exchange participants),"" said another Europe-based trader.(Reporting by Maytaal Angel and Marcelo Teixera; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"
44,0f9078a2-e66e-3037-ae03-c4fcfe96db1e,VZ,2022-11-06,"With 64% ownership of the shares, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/64-ownership-shares-verizon-communications-120133196.html,1667736093,STORY,['VZ'],"[A look at the shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 64% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Verizon Communications. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Verizon Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Verizon Communications' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Verizon Communications. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Verizon Communications Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$28m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 36% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors.

45,f6bae5ff-1708-3a41-9f36-d7cc5ebc6f0a,NVDA,2022-11-06,NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Popularity With Investors Is Under Threat From Overpricing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporations-nasdaq-nvda-popularity-120142927.html,1667736102,STORY,['NVDA'],"[When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 14x, you may consider NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 45.5x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times haven't been advantageous for NVIDIA as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA peKeen to find out how analysts think NVIDIA's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, NVIDIA would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 8.8%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 176% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.4% each year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that NVIDIA's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's P/E?It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that NVIDIA currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Plus, you should also learn about this   1 warning sign we've spotted with NVIDIA.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

There have been accusations that Ireland's economic growth is distorted due to Ireland having favorable corporate tax regimes which has led to many major foreign companies merging with companies in Ireland and moving their headquarters to the company to take advantage of the aforesaid corporate tax regime. Mainly companies in the United States have decided to move their headquarters to Ireland starting with Accenture in 2009. To a lesser extent, the United Kingdom also has had companies moving their headquarters to Ireland. This has also been dubbed as ""leprechaun economics"" by economists while a few multinationals including the Central Bank of Ireland have proposed alternative methods of calculation. These moves, especially for companies in the United States have said to have reduced the effective tax rate on corporations from 30% to 20% while these corporations have highly artificially inflated the GDP of the country.Story continuesTo determine the largest companies headquartered in Ireland, we headed over to Forbes Global 2000 list for 2022 and filtered out companies in Ireland.

(NYSE:UPS) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-united-parcel-120332730.html,1667736212,STORY,['UPS'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is about to go ex-dividend in just 3 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase United Parcel Service's shares before the 10th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.52 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$6.08 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, United Parcel Service has a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current stock price of $165.69. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. United Parcel Service paid out a comfortable 44% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether United Parcel Service generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 46% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see United Parcel Service has grown its earnings rapidly, up 27% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. United Parcel Service has delivered 10% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayHas United Parcel Service got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that United Parcel Service is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about United Parcel Service, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for United Parcel Service that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials How Fast Is Martin Marietta Materials Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Martin Marietta Materials grew its EPS by 13% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that, last year, Martin Marietta Materials' revenue from operations was lower than its revenue, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for Martin Marietta Materials remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 16% to US$5.9b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Martin Marietta Materials' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Martin Marietta Materials Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Martin Marietta Materials, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$132m. We note that this amounts to 0.6% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Martin Marietta Materials but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Martin Marietta Materials Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Martin Marietta Materials is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Martin Marietta Materials  that you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

56,2e34399e-2f44-3558-a52b-7cf4c81e3fb5,MDLZ,2022-11-06,"Is Mondelez International, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MDLZ) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-international-inc-nasdaq-mdlz-120050981.html,1667736050,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Mondelez International's (NASDAQ:MDLZ) stock increased significantly by 13% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Mondelez International's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mondelez International is:12% = US$3.1b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Mondelez International's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Mondelez International's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Mondelez International's moderate 6.7% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesWe then compared Mondelez International's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 4.9% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MDLZ? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Mondelez International Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Mondelez International has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 45% (or a retention ratio of 55%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, Mondelez International has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 52% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Mondelez International's future ROE will rise to 17% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Mondelez International's performance has been quite good.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest food and beverage companies in the world in 2022.The biggest food and beverage companies in the world in 2022 are mostly full of household names. The global food and beverage industry is worth trillions of dollars and grew from $5,818 billion in 2021 to jump to $6,327 billion in 2022 at a very decent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. Despite facing several issues which we'll discuss in a moment, the industry is expected to grow to $7,942 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 5.8% according to the Business Research Company.The food and beverage sector was quite badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic which engulfed the world in 2020. Most restaurants and bars were closed immediately and were among the last to open after restrictions were ended in most countries. Furthermore, the global supply chain was significantly affected as well, affecting the operations of most major corporations and especially those with international operations. According to a report by Deloitte, food and beverage companies faced lower consumptions during the pandemic even as at-home consumption increased, which typically has lower margins. Even though out of home consumption has now increased, it is still not at levels before the pandemic as many potential customers now prefer at-home consumption mainly for comfort reasons.Largest Food and Beverage Companies in the World in 2022Copyright: stockbroker / 123RF Stock PhotoWhile recovery from the pandemic loomed in early 2021, the Russia-Ukraine war turned everything on its head. The war has resulted in a lot of sanctions imposed by mainly the West has resulted in the prices of commodities soaring which has resulted in higher costs for the food and beverage industry. The supply chain has also faced disruption because of the war which has also resulted in uneven supply and higher costs. Further, inflation has soared globally with many countries facing record levels of soaring prices, which has reduced disposable income and hence, spending on food and beverages.Story continuesTo determine the biggest food and beverage companies in the world in 2022, we referred to Forbes Global 2000 list and isolated those companies which are part of the food and beverage industry. We have only considered public companies because while there are companies such as Mars Wrigley which is a massive company, there is no information available as the company does not issue annual reports and of course, does not have a market cap. We considered three criteria namely revenue, market cap, profits and assets, with 30% weightage each assigned to the first three criteria and 10% to the last one. For market cap, we checked each company's latest market cap on Yahoo Finance and used it to base our rankings on.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.5bUS$8.49bUS$6.82bUS$6.68bUS$6.63bUS$6.64bUS$6.68bUS$6.75bUS$6.84bUS$6.95bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.74%Est @ 0.08%Est @ 0.65%Est @ 1.05%Est @ 1.33%Est @ 1.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4% US$10.5kUS$7.1kUS$5.2kUS$4.7kUS$4.2kUS$3.9kUS$3.6kUS$3.3kUS$3.0kUS$2.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.0%) = US$95bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$95b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$39bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$87b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$73.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.448. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The 20.9% stake does not include these holdings.""Reporting its proportional share of earnings will reduce Berkshire's price-earnings multiple, making its stock look less expensive,"" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst covering Berkshire at Edward Jones &amp; Co.Berkshire uses the equity method for its 26.5% stake in packaged food company Kraft Heinz Co and 38.6% stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers.Kraft Heinz is controlled by Berkshire and Brazil's 3G Capital, and its board includes three directors from Berkshire. The Pilot stake is expected to grow to 80% early next year.Story continuesBerkshire does not use the equity method for its 20.3% stake in American Express Co, reflecting its 1995 agreement with the Federal Reserve board of governors to keep the stake passive.Some investors and analysts have said Berkshire could eventually buy Occidental, diversifying its energy portfolio.Berkshire paid $26.5 billion in 2010 for the BNSF railroad, after earlier amassing a 22.6% stake.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Diane Craft)]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Coca-Cola with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Coca-Cola grew its EPS by 7.9% per year. While that sort of growth rate isn't anything to write home about, it does show the business is growing.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While Coca-Cola did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Coca-Cola?Story continuesAre Coca-Cola Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Coca-Cola has a market capitalisation of US$256b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.7b. This comes in at 0.7% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Coca-Cola To Your Watchlist?One positive for Coca-Cola is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Before you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola that we have uncovered.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

63,20faab26-f886-362e-be83-25a511855a8f,INTU,2022-11-06,Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-inc-nasdaq-intu-stock-130021022.html,1667739621,STORY,['INTU'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) recent performance, when its stock has declined 23% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Intuit's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Intuit How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuit is:13% = US$2.1b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Intuit's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Intuit's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. This certainly adds some context to Intuit's moderate 15% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Intuit's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 25% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for INTU? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Intuit Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 32% (implying that the company retains 68% of its profits), it seems that Intuit is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Intuit has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 22%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Intuit's performance has been quite good.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest companies headquartered in Ireland.The third-largest island in Europe, Ireland boasts a highly developed knowledge which is focused on financial services, life sciences, high-tech and agribusiness. Considered to be an open economy, Ireland ranks top in the world for high-value foreign direct investment while in terms of GDP per capita, it ranks 4th in lists compiled by the International Monetary Fund as well as the the World Bank. All of this is even more impressive considering the fact that after consistent growth for 23 years, Ireland was badly affected by the global 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the Irish property bubble, which resulted in the country entering a recession.Largest Companies Headquartered in IrelandJames Kennedy NI/Shutterstock.comIreland's economy finally rebounded in 2011, growing by 2.2%, followed by 0.2% in 2012, before plunging into another crisis driven by the European sovereign-debt crisis before rebounding again. There have been accusations that Ireland's economic growth is distorted due to Ireland having favorable corporate tax regimes which has led to many major foreign companies merging with companies in Ireland and moving their headquarters to the company to take advantage of the aforesaid corporate tax regime. Mainly companies in the United States have decided to move their headquarters to Ireland starting with Accenture in 2009. To a lesser extent, the United Kingdom also has had companies moving their headquarters to Ireland. This has also been dubbed as ""leprechaun economics"" by economists while a few multinationals including the Central Bank of Ireland have proposed alternative methods of calculation. These moves, especially for companies in the United States have said to have reduced the effective tax rate on corporations from 30% to 20% while these corporations have highly artificially inflated the GDP of the country.Story continuesTo determine the largest companies headquartered in Ireland, we headed over to Forbes Global 2000 list for 2022 and filtered out companies in Ireland. We then ranked these companies based on revenue, profits, assets and market value as of 29th October 2022.

65,adc725a1-ef86-3292-9e14-2806e41ed04a,UNH,2022-11-06,UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) Returns Have Hit A Wall,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-groups-nyse-unh-returns-120038630.html,1667736038,STORY,['UNH'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for UnitedHealth Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$27b ÷ (US$243b - US$101b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 19%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 10% it's much better. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceIn the above chart we have measured UnitedHealth Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For UnitedHealth Group Tell Us?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 19% and the business has deployed 72% more capital into its operations. 19% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that UnitedHealth Group has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesAnother thing to note, UnitedHealth Group has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 42%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.In Conclusion...The main thing to remember is that UnitedHealth Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 174% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.UnitedHealth Group does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

67,12c4ae04-9629-3c13-8f42-65759a1eccce,ORLY,2022-11-06,"O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 87% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oreilly-automotive-inc-nasdaq-orly-134448873.html,1667655888,STORY,['ORLY'],"[If you want to know who really controls O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of O'Reilly Automotive. See our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About O'Reilly Automotive?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that O'Reilly Automotive does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at O'Reilly Automotive's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in O'Reilly Automotive. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 4.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 23 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of O'Reilly AutomotiveThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.. Insiders own US$558m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in O'Reilly Automotive. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand O'Reilly Automotive better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for O'Reilly Automotive  you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Is There Some Growth For Regeneron Pharmaceuticals?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 24%. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 155% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 6.8% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.4% growth per year, that's a disappointing outcome.In light of this, it's somewhat alarming that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings are unlikely to support a more positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

If we do dive into a recession, cash-rich stocks will be more than prepared for whatever slowdown comes their way. However, when investing, it’s not enough to look for businesses with cash. They should also have limited debt and strong cash flow generation in good times and bad. So, who are these companies?For this article, I selected four large-cap and three mid-cap cash-rich stocks to buy. Cash-rich to me means having net cash on the balance sheet. There aren’t many around but with interest rates rising; it’s more important than ever to have manageable finances. To make the cut, a stock must have net cash that’s at least 5% of its market capitalization. MRNAModerna$154.59REGNRegeneron$727.32ATVIActivision Blizzard$71.61CSGPCoStar Group$78.07GRMNGarmin$84.60INCYIncyte$76.83FSLRFirst Solar$149.46InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsModerna (MRNA)Moderna (MRNA) research Coronavirus (Covid 19) vaccine.

It had zero debt and $8.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That’s 14.5% of its current market cap. The vaccine company’s stock wobbled a little on the disappointing news, which included cutting its vaccine sales estimate by $2 billion to $3 billion in 2022. The company cut the full-year estimate due to supply constraints. Where have we heard that before?“We’ve had quite a number of pain points,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel, as quoted by Barron’s. “We are working through a lot of those issues… There are many lessons to be learned that we are working on.”It’s easy to sit here in the cheap seats and criticize the company for missing revenue estimates in the quarter by $100 million and cutting the number of its advanced purchase agreements by $2 billion to $3 billion for all of 2022. However, those were merely deferred until 2023. In the end, the company has still generated $7.8 billion in operating profits through the nine months that ended Sept. 30. In fiscal 2020, it had an operating loss of $763 million. It could always be worse for long-time shareholders.Story continuesRegeneron (REGN)The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comRegeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) reported its Q3 2022 results on Nov. 3. While it beat analyst expectations, earnings were down 28% over Q3 2021. In terms of revenues, sales were 15% lower year-over-year to $2.94 billion due to lower numbers from Regen-Cov, the company’s Covid-19 antibody treatment. The good news is that sales beat the estimate by $30 million. Excluding Regen-Cov, the company’s sales rose 11% in the quarter.REGN stock is up more than 18% on the year as I write this. That’s considerably better than the S&amp;P 500 healthcare sector, which is down 7.5% through Nov. 2.  In addition, the biotech had $13 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Sept. go along with $2 billion in long-term debt. Its net cash position is $11 billion, 13.6% of its current market cap.  Eylea, the company’s drug to slow vision loss, generated 55% of its revenue in the third quarter.

Microsoft made no such guarantees. It now faces a potentially lengthy full-scale probe by the Commission. The regulatory body has until Nov. 8 to announce a Phase 2 investigation. Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox business, and the person responsible for ATVI’s integration into Microsoft believes the deal will happen. “I’m pretty confident in the deal closing,” he told The Tech Game. “I think [regulators] are asking good, honest questions about a big deal … it’s definitely the biggest deal I’ve ever done.” In addition, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) has an 8.7% stake in ATVI worth $4.9 billion. The company bought 14.7 million shares in Q4 2021 before Microsoft announced the $95 a share offer in Jan. By the end of Q1 2022, it owned 64.3 million shares.

Real estate stocks.Source: Stock-Asso / ShutterstockIf you work in commercial real estate, you’ve probably worked with CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP). Its reason for being is to provide real estate information, analytics, news, and online marketplaces. Its online brands include CoStar, LoopNet, Apartments.com, and BizBuySell. Relative to the S&amp;P 500, CSGP stock is having a good year, up 1.3%, more than 23% better than the index. Since mid-July, its stock has taken off, up 43% in less than four months. At the end of October, CoStar reported healthy growth in its third quarter.On the top line, revenues were up 12% YOY, with a 62% increase in net new bookings. That’s significant because CoStar operates a subscription-based business. New bookings mean recurring revenue. That’s the best kind. On the bottom line, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was $153 million, 6.0% higher than a year earlier. Those aren’t spectacular results, but they were enough for the company to raise its guidance for 2022. It now expects at least $2.18 billion in revenue and an adjusted EBITDA of $665 million.  As CoStar CFO Scott Wheeler stated in its Q3 2022 press release, “Our financial results in the third quarter and improved 2022 revenue outlook demonstrate the strength of our products and resilience of our subscription-based business model. “We are making great progress with our Residential investment strategy while managing investment levels well below our initial estimates. This results in our improved profit outlook for 2022.”Garmin (GRMN) A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comGarmin (NYSE:GRMN) is down from an all-time high of $178.81. Yet, the “Cult of Garmin” remains strong. The company reported Q3 2022 results on Oct. 26 that were mixed from an analyst estimate perspective. On the top line, it delivered sales of $1.14 billion, $70 million shy of the consensus. However, on the bottom line, it beat by eight cents at $1.24 a share.The good news is that its gross margin increased by 40 basis points in the quarter to 58.8%. As a result, it raised its earnings outlook for all of 2022 to $4.95 a share. The bad news is that the company lowered its revenue guidance to $4.85 billion. A real bright point in 2022 is its Outdoor business. Through the first nine months, the unit’s revenues increased 22% YOY to $1.11 billion, putting it first amongst its five operating segments. More importantly, Outdoor has an operating profit margin exceeding 34%. That’s lights-out good.Lastly, Garmin finished the third quarter with $1.46 billion in net cash, representing 9.1% of its market cap. Trading at 3.3x sales, it’s cheaper than it’s been since 2016, and it’s got a healthy 3.33% dividend yield.

It was Swift Current’s second big order from First Solar in 2022.However, it turns out Swift Current has nothing to do with Swift Current, Saskatchewan. It turns out the renewable energy company is based in Boston. The news, regardless of geography, is excellent news for both companies. First Solar is doubling down on its commitment to American manufacturing. It is spending $1.2 billion to expand its Ohio manufacturing facility and open its fourth U.S. plant. The company recently increased its guidance for net sales in 2022 while lowering its outlook for operating profits. The cause for lower profitability had to do with unexpected additional logistics costs. The good news is First Solar is a business with more than 58 GW of modules yet to be shipped. It also finished the third quarter with $1.93 billion in cash on its balance sheet and zero debt, representing 12% of its market cap. It’s an excellent long-term buy.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
