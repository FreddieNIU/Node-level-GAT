1,582a9bf8-883c-36d2-9a4b-2d8bc9d66a34,TXN,2022-09-26,Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) shareholders have earned a 15% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-shareholders-110017747.html,1664190017,STORY,['TXN'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) shareholders have enjoyed a 80% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 40% (not including dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Texas Instruments achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Texas Instruments' TSR for the last 5 years was 105%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Texas Instruments returned a loss of 17% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 15% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

2,fc3d61aa-c836-3cbe-b851-6aa0f8d342ce,UNM,2022-09-26,"Zacks.com featured highlights include Marathon Petroleum, Unum Group, HF Sinclair and Murphy USA",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-com-featured-highlights-marathon-082808949.html,1664180888,STORY,"['MPC', 'UNM', 'MUSA', 'DINO']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 26, 2022 – Stocks in this week’s article are Marathon Petroleum MPC, Unum Group UNM, HF Sinclair DINO and Murphy USA MUSA.4 Stocks with Recent Price Strength for Volatile TimesThe Fed’s latest move to raise its core interest rate by another 0.75% has cast a pall over the stock market. It led to a precipitous drop in the equity indices on Thursday — marking the third consecutive day of declines and falling to lows not seen since July. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.As such, trading is expected to be choppy for the U.S. stock markets going ahead, even as investors have been witnessing extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022. Risks stemming from recession fears, geopolitical tensions and dwindling liquidity may also lead to a rough road for equities.In the current jittery market environment, for investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup, it is time to focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Here are the four stocks that made it through the screen:HF Sinclair: HF Sinclair is a producer and marketer of gasoline, diesel fuel and other specialty products.

DINO shares have gained 61.6% in a year.Marathon Petroleum: Based in Findlay, OH, the company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

3,90f4c5b5-c688-3f58-94ee-f6c6e22686b4,STT,2022-09-26,"State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) Looks Like A Good Stock, And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corporation-nyse-stt-122508819.html,1664195108,STORY,['STT'],"[State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in three days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase State Street's shares on or after the 30th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.63 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.52 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that State Street has a trailing yield of 4.0% on the current share price of $63.63. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether State Street's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for State Street Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. State Street paid out a comfortable 31% of its profit last year.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at State Street, with earnings per share up 7.5% on average over the last five years.Story continuesState Street also issued more than 5% of its market cap in new stock during the past year, which we feel is likely to hurt its dividend prospects in the long run. Trying to grow the dividend while issuing large amounts of new shares reminds us of the ancient Greek tale of Sisyphus - perpetually pushing a boulder uphill.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, State Street has increased its dividend at approximately 13% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid State Street? State Street has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Overall, State Street looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.Ever wonder what the future holds for State Street? See what the 12 analysts we track are forecasting,  with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flowIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

IRT and BRT Apartments Corp. BRT.Industry: Residential REITLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1984188/3-top-stocks-from-a-prosperous-residential-reit-industryThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential constituents are expected to benefit from the healthy fundamentals of this industry. Rental housing demand remains robust, with young adults forming new households and the job market showing improvement. De-densification and the desire for more space is leading to fewer adults per apartment, thereby creating incremental demand for renting units. Moreover, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option.While product absorption continues in the Sun Belt and other non-gateway metros, the gateway metros are also showcasing a strong rebound. Therefore, residential REITs like Equity Residential, Independence Realty Trust, Inc. and BRT Apartments Corp. are expected to ride the growth curve, despite interest rate hike, elevated deliveries and regulation woes.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs also focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region.Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, enrollment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Healthy Rental Demand, Rent and Occupancy Growth: The urban and job-centered suburban markets have been experiencing a continued flow of residents with the reopening of offices and returning of lifestyle amenities to the established markets. Moreover, de-densification and the desire for more space are resulting in fewer adults per apartment, thereby creating incremental demand for renting units.Also, higher household income is supporting rent growth. There is strong demand from young adults who are gaining from tight labor market conditions and record wage growth. Since high mortgage rates have increased the cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is becoming difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option. These positives are supporting high occupancy and rent growth for properties of residential REITs.While in most parts of the United States, apartment rents are climbing, growth is taking place at a moderate rate reflecting a more seasonal trend. This indicates that the fundamentals are still healthy but trending toward a sustainable level. In terms of markets, while there is a rebound in demand for the coastal markets, the Sun Belt markets too, continued to experience high demand compared to supply.There has also been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. In fact, the fall 2022 pre-lease season closed with record occupancy and growth in rents.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend, and now the residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, as well as enhancing customer experience. The REITs are now focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in process and process enhancements.Improvement in search and tour booking as well as smart home access has gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on these. Such efforts are aimed at generating incremental net operating income in the years ahead.Rent Control and Higher Interest Rates: The rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In fact, in recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees. Moreover, the hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #87, which places it at the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s FFO per share estimate for 2022 and 2023 has moved 4.2% and 0.6% north, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 20.7% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 16.2% and the broader Finance sector’s decline of 14.7%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 16.76X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 16.30X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector’s forward 12-month P/E of 12.83X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.47X, as low as 15.90X, with a median of 19.03X.3 Residential REIT Stocks Worth Betting OnEquity Residential: Based in Chicago, IL, this residential REIT is one of the leading, publicly-traded multi-family REITs in the United States. It is well-positioned to benefit from the improving demand for apartment living, its portfolio rebalancing efforts in the urban and suburban markets, and a strong balance sheet.It concluded a strong leasing season, driven by healthy demand and pricing for its apartment units. As a result, same-store revenue growth is on track to either match or surpass the projections mentioned in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Also, occupancy levels remained high.Equity Residential’s efforts to diversify its portfolio in the urban and suburban markets, with an affluent tenant base, bode well. Its strategic buyouts and focus on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency of its operating platform act as tailwinds.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates revised marginally upward over the past month to $3.51. The company’s shares have declined 4.1% in the past three months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Independence Realty Trust, Inc.:This Philadelphia, PA-based residential REIT is focused on ownership and operations of multifamily apartment properties across non-gateway U.S. markets, including Atlanta, Louisville, Memphis, and Raleigh. IRT targets boosting its presence in amenity-rich submarkets that offer good school districts, high-quality retail and major employment centers.Independence Realty Trust is poised to benefit from the healthy fundamentals in its non-gateway markets and its value-add program. The company is targeting the expansion of its presence in core markets through its capital recycling and joint venture development efforts.Independence Realty Trust currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year FFO per share has been revised 1.9% upward in two months to $1.08. The company’s shares have declined 14.5% over the past three months. BRT Apartments Corp.: This residential REIT, headquartered in Great Neck, NY, is engaged in the ownership, operation and, to a lesser extent, development of multifamily properties mainly in Sun Belt locations.With well-located properties in growth markets, this residential REIT is poised to benefit from the growth in population in-migration of jobs in its markets. Also, the shortage of quality housing is likely to act as a positive.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has witnessed upward estimate revisions in recent times, indicating analysts’ bullish stance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share has been revised 5.8% upward over the past two months to $1.63. The stock has also declined 1.6% over the past three months.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

And many are starting their hunt for the perfect gift much earlier to take advantage of sales.Nearly half of the consumers Gartner spoke with plan to start shopping for the holidays in October or November of this year, while 16% now say they shop year-round for holiday gifts. Only 10% of the people the firm spoke with said they plan to spend more and the majority of those said that was only because of higher prices due to inflation.“While consumers have increased their discretionary spending in the past few years, inflationary pressure is impacting their spending plans for this holiday season,” said Kassi Socha, director analyst in the Gartner Marketing practice. “This hesitancy around budgets, coupled with new timing from consumers regarding their holiday shopping, will challenge marketers to have an always-on approach that will stress the need for omnichannel adoption.”And, rather than potentially wasting money on something the recipient might not like, more consumers will be turning to gift cards this year.

Like a growing number of digital nomads in China, he’s turned his back on big-city living and moved to the tourist hub in Yunnan province, famed for its snowcapped mountains, ancient temples and pagodas.Most Read from BloombergApple Ditches iPhone Production Increase After Demand FaltersMacKenzie Scott Files for Divorce From Science Teacher HusbandTrump Refuses to Delay Florida Deposition in Phone-Fraud Case Despite HurricaneNord Stream Gas Leaks May Be a New Disaster for the ClimateThe UK’s Crisis of Confidence Was Years in the Making“I’m working on a normal job with relatively fixed hours,” said Hao, who’s employed by a technology firm in Shenzhen, a city of more than 17 million people about 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) to the southeast. “It’s just that I don’t have to go to an office and I have some flexibility to do my own thing.”China is catching up with the global trend of tech-savvy workers choosing cheaper and prettier locations to base themselves — a lifestyle that’s gained traction since the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a rethink of work-life balance.The backdrop to digital nomadism in China, however, is unique. It offers a middle path between two quite extreme attitudes to work — the “996” culture prevalent in some tech firms of toiling 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week, and the protest culture of doing as little work as possible, known as “tang ping” or lying flat.Proponents like Daniel Ng, who runs a co-working space in Dali, believes a happy medium can help reduce a youth jobless rate that’s hovering around 20% as the economy slows. An influx of creative, entrepreneurial people that typically include livestreamers, vloggers, online teachers and tech support workers can also help local authorities revitalize towns depleted of tourists by the pandemic.Read More: From the Great Resignation to Lying Flat, Workers Are Opting OutStory continuesBut the future looks far from certain. As big tech firms such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. lay off thousands of staff, companies can be choosier about who they wish to keep and what perks they will offer. And then there’s government policies such as the household registration system that have limited mobility for some migrant workers.Digital nomadism will take on a “bigger part of the future of work,” said Rachael Woldoff, a professor of sociology at West Virginia University and co-author of “Digital Nomads: In Search of Freedom, Community and Meaningful Work in the New Economy.”“What is less clear to us is whether Chinese work culture is ready to adapt to this and how much Chinese workers would want to engage in it,” she said.Dali, a city of just over half a million, has long been known as a backpackers’ paradise, with a touristy Old Town where travelers can find cheap lodging, Western-style bars and southeast Asian cuisine. The area is famous for its natural beauty, with Erhai Lake to the east and the Cangshan Mountains to the west.About a 10-minute walk from Old Town is Dali Hub, a three-story white stucco building located in a quiet street that literally translates as “reclusive immortals.” Like many co-working places, it has a cafe, desks and space for events. The building, which has a rooftop with mountain views, offers accommodation for nomads and serves as a haven for like-minded people who want to work on their own terms.“People are really sick of the company culture in China like 996,” said co-founder Ng, who is originally from southeastern Fujian province and lived for several years in Malaysia.“Because of Covid, everyone is struggling, stuck in the cities” and people need the freedom to choose where they work and live, said Ng. “If you work in a cube, you don’t really have that kind of creativity.”While remote working has grown rapidly in countries such as the US, and seen nations including Argentina offer special visas to attract remote workers, it remains relatively unconventional in the world’s second-largest economy.Gartner Inc. predicts 31% of the global workforce will be remote this year, either fully or partly working away from their employers. It says the US will lead with 53%, while 28% of workers in China will be remote.There are several obstacles to being a digital nomad in China. Many workers still prefer the security of government employment, especially during times of economic distress. With an ongoing crackdown on private enterprise and the nation’s big tech companies, fresh college graduates are increasingly seeking jobs in the state sector despite the lower pay.There are practical considerations as well. While China’s household registration system, known as hukou, isn’t as much a restraint on mobility for nomads as it is for migrant workers, their itinerant status and self-employment could make it difficult to access the social welfare system that covers healthcare insurance and pensions.Still, co-working ventures are emerging in regional areas, partly due to improved internet access. About 28% of China’s web users were living in rural regions as of June, according to the China Internet Network Information Center, a government-backed body that provides research on the sector.In Anji, a town in eastern China’s Zhejiang province made famous by the bamboo forests featured in Ang Lee’s “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” film, a government-backed hub offers co-working spaces and creative labs for nomads willing to live in harmony with the local tea growers.Jingdezhen, a city in China’s southeast Jiangxi province known for its porcelain making, also hosts a digital nomad hub. The local government there has worked with Tsinghua University’s institute for culture and creativity to develop village economies based on tourism. It’s part of a broader effort to make rural development a growth engine for the economy, in turn reducing the urban-rural divide and increasing self-reliance.The remote working culture benefits “location-independent professionals” and also companies, which can save on office rents and the higher salaries demanded by employees in big cities, according to Olga Hannonen, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Eastern Finland who studies the trend.It’s particularly well-suited to virtual influencers and livestreamers, she said. China’s livestreaming e-commerce market grew to 1.2 trillion yuan ($170 billion) in 2020, with influencers hawking wares from lipstick to smartphones in a Gen-Z version of the Home Shopping Network.Back in Dali, the sense of community among the nomads is all important. A co-working venture called DAO Space that opened in August in an old bed-sheet factory charges customers just 480 yuan a month.“Ideally we hope to build an self-sustained economy here,” said a former English tutor who identified himself as Glitch Boy, as he’s known in the local group of digital nomads. The space provides “an arena for people to exchange their resources and skills so that we can grow our little community.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper PlacesGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyMental Health Crisis Leads Hospitals to Create a New Type of ER©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Price is number two. Sustainability is number three,"" Hardy said of key priorities in the short term.More than a million barrels per day of U.S. crude is expected to go to Europe to fill the gap in Russian supplies, he told a forum at the 38th Annual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) 2022 conference, adding that Russian commodities would need to find a home in places outside the United Kingdom, United States and European Union.""It's going to go further and longer distances and find different markets, and in doing that it's going to have to trade at a discount,"" Hardy said.""You're beginning to see that with fuel coming East that would otherwise have stayed in Europe, and fuel in the East going to the West to cover the shortfall.""The EU is set to ban Russian crude oil from December in a move to strip the Kremlin of revenue, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Russian crude oil imports into the EU and UK last fell to 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in August from 2.6 million bpd in January, according to data from the IEA, though the EU was still the biggest market for Russian crude.The IEA also forecasted that the United States could soon overtake Russia as the main crude supplier to the EU and the UK combined.LNG INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDEDRussia's gas supply cuts have placed enormous strain on the European market, with high gas prices expected to affect 60-80% of demand, Hardy said.Story continuesEurope will also need more infrastructure for liquefied natural gas (LNG) discharge as the continent's infrastructure is ""basically full,"" he added.""We're going to need more supply but the slots are more important at the moment because the need is immediate,"" Hardy said.Global gas prices rose to record levels this year, as Russia cut supplies to Europe while oil prices touched multi-year highs in March.Brent crude futures eased in recent weeks on worries that recession would reduce demand but are expected to hit $100 again on tight supplies when the European Union sanctions on Russian oil are implemented in December and February.(Writing by Emily Chow; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)]"

Both contracts were trading just above their weakest level in eight months and were nursing steep losses from last week.Prices trimmed early gains on Monday after Japanese business activity data showed manufacturing activity in the world’s second-largest economy grew at a slower pace in September from the prior month.The reading came on the heels of dismal business activity data from the Eurozone and the UK last week, which heightened fears of a global recession.Oil prices plummeted last week after the weak economic readings. Hawkish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve also cemented expectations for higher interest rates this year.Traders fear that a mix of high inflation and rising interest rates will cause a slowdown in economic activity, denting demand for oil. Crude prices have plummeted from highs hit during the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war on that notion.Strength in the dollar, which was trading at 20-year highs, also weighed on oil prices. A stronger greenback tends to make crude imports more expensive, weighing on demand. Major Asian importers India and Indonesia face headwinds from a stronger dollar.An economic slowdown in China, the world’s largest crude importer, has also weighed heavily on demand this year.Threats of production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week did little to deter declines in crude. News of a potential escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which is likely to disrupt global crude supply, also caused only a short-lived bounce in prices.But traders still expect crude demand to improve in the fourth quarter, particularly in the event of a harsh European winter, which could push up demand for heating oil.Story continuesU.S. gasoline demand is also expected to improve as fuel prices ease further from record highs in the country.Related ArticlesOil Prices Hover Near 8-Mth Low as Recession Fears Dent OutlookOil claws back some losses but strong dollar caps gainsGold Pinned Below $1,650, Copper Extends Losses on Recession Fears]"

Firms including Alphabet Inc.’s Google are at risk of advertisers cutting spending as the global economy struggles, while streaming services including Netflix Inc. face an exodus of price-sensitive subscribers with consumers tightening their belts.The Nasdaq 100 is down about 31% so far this year, wiping trillions of dollars in market value, as investors reassess the post-pandemic value of many business models. Interest-rate hikes are hitting stocks and diminishing the value of their future earnings. Inflation is driving up costs, while a stronger dollar is weighing on profits and the threat of recession is growing. Retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. are finding some their direct responses to the Covid-19 pandemic — such as massive investments in warehouses and workers to pack products in them — are coming back to bite them. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.5% in Monday trading as global risk assets extended their selloff.Apple Inc. said it will raise the price of its App Store purchases across Asia and countries that use the euro, as the value of foreign currencies collapses relative to the dollar. Microsoft Corp. lowered its forecast because of the currency’s strength in June. And in July, Sony Group Corp. warned investors about the impact of the global economic slowdown, especially in Europe, and the adverse effects of the strong dollar on its financial results. The Bloomberg dollar index, which tracks greenback’s performance against 10 leading global currencies, has set new record since those announcements were made.Story continuesTech’s earnings are projected to lag the S&amp;P 500 in the third and fourth quarters. Info tech’s earnings per share are estimated to fall 6.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to a 3.2% gain for the overall S&amp;P 500, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. The Nasdaq 100’s 12-month forward EPS has dropped about 2.9% since June 1, compared to a 0.8% drop for the S&amp;P 500.Meanwhile, retail and professional investors are also bearish on the metaverse. More than 70% of MLIV Pulse respondents said they knew what the metaverse was but that it won't change the way they interact with people and businesses over the next two years. The sentiment sits awkwardly with how Mark Zuckerberg described the metaverse’s potential. It’s “the next frontier,” he said when the billionaire changed his company’s name from Facebook to Meta Platforms Inc.His company said that investments in Reality Labs, the Meta division that makes hardware such as virtual-reality headsets, reduced operating profit by $10 billion in 2021. Computer-graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp. wants its Omniverse platform to power some of the underlying framework for the metaverse, as does software-maker Unity Software Inc. Innumerable technology companies, both massive and minuscule, have big ambitions for the metaverse. Yet despite the grand promise from industry leaders, MLIV respondents are muted in their enthusiasm for its potential.On the bright side, technology companies that focus on sustainable and power-efficient products are likely to benefit from the unprecedented energy crisis in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. After Russia restricted natural gas supplies to heavily-reliant neighbors, electricity prices surged to record levels, and governments are fighting off a potential economic collapse.Investors see high power bills and scarcity of fuels boosting the development of green solutions. Retail players were the most optimistic, with 63% of respondents saying they believed a gas-and-oil crisis would encourage the development of sustainable electronics. Sixty percent of professional respondents agreed.“If we had invested more in energy efficiency, and invested more in renewable energy, then we would be in a better position,” Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.“The nearly 5x surge in European gas prices over the past 12 months is providing a nice tailwind for clean energy equipment suppliers with companies like SolarEdge or Enphase on track to boost sales by more than 50% this year,” said Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Clean Energy Analyst Rob Barnett.Respondents are somewhat more sanguine when it comes to their positioning. About a third said they planned to increase their exposure to tech stocks, just under a third said they’d reduce it, and the rest said they’d hold steady over the next six months. Tech remains attractive on some metrics, such as the current price-to-earnings ratio compared to its 10-year average, while companies like Apple are still big cash generators. More generally, it’s hard to avoid tech — the S&amp;P 500’s biggest sector by far at almost 27%.To subscribe to MLIV Pulse stories, click here.

Global Compute, constituted in 2020 by former co-founders of Digital Realty Trust and led by a team of international datacenter veterans with over 90 years of combined industry experience, is backed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. SCG is the first and longest-standing large-cap, exclusively Latin America-dedicated pan-regional private equity investment fund with more than 20 years of history. The combination of Global Compute and SCG provides unique sector and regional knowledge to DHA as well as highly relevant commercial, technical and institutional relationships. The combination of this expertise and financial backing will assist DHA as it grows the platform through organic, data center campus development as well as potential acquisitions of existing facilities and platforms.Global Compute InfrastructureDHA is also announcing today its first campus launch, located in the Bogota Metropolitan Region, Colombia. The campus site sits within Zona Franca Occidente (ZFO), a fully secured economic free zone, and covers over 50,000 m2 (12.4 acres) – more than double the size of any other contiguous plot within the same park that could be suitable for datacenter development. The campus will support up to 55 MWs of total datacenter power and it is ideally suited to satisfy the customary scale, growth, and other long-term commitment needs of global hyperscale deployments. Initial design parameters include over 29,500 m2 (317,500 sf) within a multitude of building and data hall configurations based on demand and customer needs, enabling concurrent maintainability operations consistent with tier III industry standards, while allowing flexible diverse redundancy topology to support up to 40 MW of critical IT load capacity, including high-density deployments. The campus is proximate to all major peering exchange points and can deliver initial capacity as early as 1H24.Story continues""Investing in this early-stage datacenter market through the DHA platform closely aligns with Global Compute's stated objectives of serving the critical deployment needs of customers around the world, whether through existing platform expansion as we are doing with our Atman, S.A. portfolio company in Poland, or creating a platform to service an undersupplied market such as Bogota, Colombia"", remarked Global Compute CEO, Scott Peterson. ""We look forward to using the ZFO campus as a springboard to becoming a provider of choice not only in the Colombian market, but potentially other Latin American markets as well.""""We are extremely excited about creating DHA and bringing this new type of technology infrastructure to Colombia. Southern Cross has been investing in the country for more than a decade now, and in Latin America and the telecom sector for more than 20 years, so we feel very comfortable with this investment. Due to the potential of the sector and the quality of the partners, we believe that DHA is a unique opportunity"", said Diego Acevedo, Head of SCG in Colombia.DHA founding partner, Yusuf Nahmiyas noted ""Teaming up with two institutions with the pedigrees of Global Compute and SCG validates DHA's disciplined approach to market and site selection, resulting in our first acquisition in Bogota. Multiple other initiatives are currently under active engagement and this partnership will undoubtedly broaden and accelerate our scope of activity in Colombia as our launch market, and the broader region in due course.""About Data Horizon AmericasDHA identifies and develops premier properties in Latin America to deploy campuses of large-scale datacenters. DHA provides sustainable, innovative datacenter solutions designed to meet the tailored needs of hyperscale operators, colocation, large enterprise, and content providers, enabling customers to rapidly expand their wholesale datacenter footprints via world-class facilities and services across Latin America, starting with Colombia.www.dhamericas.comAbout Global ComputeGlobal Compute, led by a team of international industry veterans with over 90 years of combined industry experience, acquires, develops and operates data center assets across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.

(NYSE:GS) as a highly attractive investment with its 6.3x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly reduced P/E.Goldman Sachs Group could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group peKeen to find out how analysts think Goldman Sachs Group's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Goldman Sachs Group's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far underperform the market for P/E ratios like Goldman Sachs Group's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 19% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 100% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 3.5% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth each year, that's a disappointing outcome.With this information, we are not surprised that Goldman Sachs Group is trading at a P/E lower than the market. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.Story continuesThe Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Goldman Sachs Group's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group  you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

Futures on the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.5% in Monday trading as global risk assets extended their selloff.Apple Inc. said it will raise the price of its App Store purchases across Asia and countries that use the euro, as the value of foreign currencies collapses relative to the dollar. Microsoft Corp. lowered its forecast because of the currency’s strength in June. And in July, Sony Group Corp. warned investors about the impact of the global economic slowdown, especially in Europe, and the adverse effects of the strong dollar on its financial results. The Bloomberg dollar index, which tracks greenback’s performance against 10 leading global currencies, has set new record since those announcements were made.Story continuesTech’s earnings are projected to lag the S&amp;P 500 in the third and fourth quarters. Info tech’s earnings per share are estimated to fall 6.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to a 3.2% gain for the overall S&amp;P 500, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. The Nasdaq 100’s 12-month forward EPS has dropped about 2.9% since June 1, compared to a 0.8% drop for the S&amp;P 500.Meanwhile, retail and professional investors are also bearish on the metaverse. More than 70% of MLIV Pulse respondents said they knew what the metaverse was but that it won't change the way they interact with people and businesses over the next two years. The sentiment sits awkwardly with how Mark Zuckerberg described the metaverse’s potential. It’s “the next frontier,” he said when the billionaire changed his company’s name from Facebook to Meta Platforms Inc.His company said that investments in Reality Labs, the Meta division that makes hardware such as virtual-reality headsets, reduced operating profit by $10 billion in 2021. Computer-graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp. wants its Omniverse platform to power some of the underlying framework for the metaverse, as does software-maker Unity Software Inc. Innumerable technology companies, both massive and minuscule, have big ambitions for the metaverse. Yet despite the grand promise from industry leaders, MLIV respondents are muted in their enthusiasm for its potential.On the bright side, technology companies that focus on sustainable and power-efficient products are likely to benefit from the unprecedented energy crisis in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. After Russia restricted natural gas supplies to heavily-reliant neighbors, electricity prices surged to record levels, and governments are fighting off a potential economic collapse.Investors see high power bills and scarcity of fuels boosting the development of green solutions. Retail players were the most optimistic, with 63% of respondents saying they believed a gas-and-oil crisis would encourage the development of sustainable electronics. Sixty percent of professional respondents agreed.“If we had invested more in energy efficiency, and invested more in renewable energy, then we would be in a better position,” Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.“The nearly 5x surge in European gas prices over the past 12 months is providing a nice tailwind for clean energy equipment suppliers with companies like SolarEdge or Enphase on track to boost sales by more than 50% this year,” said Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Clean Energy Analyst Rob Barnett.Respondents are somewhat more sanguine when it comes to their positioning. About a third said they planned to increase their exposure to tech stocks, just under a third said they’d reduce it, and the rest said they’d hold steady over the next six months. Tech remains attractive on some metrics, such as the current price-to-earnings ratio compared to its 10-year average, while companies like Apple are still big cash generators. More generally, it’s hard to avoid tech — the S&amp;P 500’s biggest sector by far at almost 27%.To subscribe to MLIV Pulse stories, click here.

They also argued that Imperial is a high-priced competitor that purchases raw sugar to refine and does not compete to lower prices.They also argued that the U.S. Department of Agriculture monitors sugar prices and can increase imports if needed to address price increases.

Both contracts were trading just above their weakest level in eight months and were nursing steep losses from last week.Prices trimmed early gains on Monday after Japanese business activity data showed manufacturing activity in the world’s second-largest economy grew at a slower pace in September from the prior month.The reading came on the heels of dismal business activity data from the Eurozone and the UK last week, which heightened fears of a global recession.Oil prices plummeted last week after the weak economic readings. Hawkish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve also cemented expectations for higher interest rates this year.Traders fear that a mix of high inflation and rising interest rates will cause a slowdown in economic activity, denting demand for oil. Crude prices have plummeted from highs hit during the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war on that notion.Strength in the dollar, which was trading at 20-year highs, also weighed on oil prices. A stronger greenback tends to make crude imports more expensive, weighing on demand. Major Asian importers India and Indonesia face headwinds from a stronger dollar.An economic slowdown in China, the world’s largest crude importer, has also weighed heavily on demand this year.Threats of production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week did little to deter declines in crude.

On Thursday, a State Department official said efforts to reinstate the agreement have ""hit a wall.""Sanctions will limit supplies, and the European Union's ban on seaborne Russian oil imports will kick in by December 5.

Still, China and India are capable of absorbing most of that volume.Story continuesWhile a stabilizing US dollar is not in JPMorgan's baseline forecast, it could also add another tailwind to oil prices, analysts added.Because oil is largely priced in dollars, gains in the greenback's value can hurt demand as it makes the commodity more expensive to purchase by holders of foreign currencies. But dollar stability appeared far off on Friday, when the US Dollar Index hit a fresh 20-year high, sending oil prices down sharply.""The threat of a global recession continues to weigh on oil prices, with widespread monetary tightening over the last couple of days fueling fears of a significant hit to growth,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note.

(NYSE:NRG), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine NRG Energy’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for NRG Energy What's The Opportunity In NRG Energy?Good news, investors! NRG Energy is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that NRG Energy’s ratio of 2.78x is below its peer average of 19.51x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Electric Utilities industry. Another thing to keep in mind is that NRG Energy’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will NRG Energy generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of NRG Energy, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although NRG is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk.

51,bd3dbe8f-473e-32c4-a62c-fcde4140a487,NEE,2022-09-26,7 Stocks to Buy During a Stock Market Crash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-during-stock-171801211.html,1663867081,STORY,"['WMT', 'GOOGL', 'TM', 'XOM', 'NEE', 'ISRG']","[Given the chaotic developments both economically and geopolitically, much discussion has centered on a potential equities market crash and how certain stocks to buy may benefit over the long run due to the subsequent discount. However, it’s fair to bring up the academic likelihood of such a scenario panning out.According to 2016 research conducted by Chicago Booth Review contributors – including Yale professor Robert J. Shiller – market experts and retail investors “judged the likelihood of a crash as much higher than shown by historical data.”You can read the data for yourself. But in summary, “investors gave estimates of the likelihood of a crash that were more than 20 times the historical precedent.” In other words, investors may be more worried right now than necessary.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNevertheless, savvy investors can (and should) strategize around certain stocks to buy that may go on steep discount.Essentially, academic reports can only cover so much. During the new normal, we’ve incurred a pandemic, cycles of economic instability and a war on European soil. Therefore, it may be inaccurate to rely solely on number-crunching of past data to reflect future probabilities. And that opens doors for certain stocks to buy – once the red ink has been priced in.GOOG, GOOGLAlphabet$100.57, $100.12ISRGIntuitive Surgical$189.40XOMExxon Mobil$91.23NEENextEra Energy$83.44TMToyota$138.98WMTWalmart$132.98COINCoinbase$63.33Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThroughout this year, companies tied to digital advertisement campaigns sounded the alarm about demand erosion. In my view, this dynamic reflects the aforementioned economic instability. With people not sure what the future holds – inflation, deflation or something else – both consumers and businesses scaled back spending. Given these troubles and others, downside for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) presents an unsurprising storyline.Story continuesStill, let’s be clear about the fundamentals. Alphabet’s Google ecosystem effectively owns the internet. For instance, take a look at global search engine market share data. Despite intense efforts from domestic powerhouses, Google remains king of digital search. Even the best that the Russians and Chinese have to offer pales in comparison to the sheer dominance of Google.Frankly, such dominance will be difficult for anyone to usurp. Part of the reason why is that Alphabet transitioned from a mere technology firm to a cultural institution. People use the word “Google” as part of their natural, everyday lexicon. So, should a stock market crash materialize, GOOG (or GOOGL) represents one of the best stocks to buy.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWhile no one likes to see red ink splashed on their portfolio, the pain may also lead to significant gain over the long run. In other words, a stock market crash could yield opportunities that a rising bullish cycle previously denied. For contrarians, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) may be an excellent pickup should the equities sector melt down.Best known for its Da Vinci system, Intuitive Surgical specializes in minimally invasive care. According to the Mayo Clinic, some of the advantages of minimally invasive procedures include less pain, faster recovery, an earlier return to work and better cosmetic results. Perhaps one of the most important advantages is shorter hospital stays, meaning less financial and emotional burden for all involved.According to Grand View Research, revenue for the minimally invasive surgical instruments market could be $60.65 billion by 2030. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% between 2022 and 2030. Thus, the expanding addressable market for Intuitive Surgical makes ISRG one of the stocks to buy following a market crash.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comPolitically and ideologically, the idea of hydrocarbon-related investments making a list of stocks to buy became more controversial. For instance, with the advent and subsequent integration of electric vehicles in the broader transportation framework, fewer enterprises carry excuses about their emissions. Therefore, mentioning Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as a discount to pick up in a stock market crash seems anachronistic.Nevertheless, big oil firms like Exxon enjoy scientific realities. One of the advantages that hydrocarbons enjoy over intermittent renewable energy sources is a higher capacity factor. Essentially, fossil fuels feature significantly less downtime than their renewable counterparts. Therefore, they are able to emit maximum power for longer periods.On the flipside, wind becomes ineffective when the wind ceases. Solar features the same ineffectiveness when the sun sets.As well, recent geopolitical flashpoints confirm that the rest of the world still runs on hydrocarbons. That’s not going to go away in a few years’ time, most likely. Therefore, should the market implode, XOM is one of the stocks to buy.NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comAfter laying out the ongoing relevance of hydrocarbon-related stocks to buy, mentioning NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) – a specialist in renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar – represents a tough transition. Nevertheless, I think the framework that a society must be completely one side or the other is unproductive. Rather, we should be focusing on net impact. As well, various forms of energy can exist side by side.On a geopolitical scale, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions devastated hydrocarbon inflows. If a lesson is to be learned, it’s that energy diversification is critical. If one source goes down, another can help pick up the slack.Specific to NextEra Energy, the company has been able to leverage the pertinence of its underlying renewable energy sector and become a consistently profitable organization. For instance, NextEra’s retained earnings currently stands at $25.2 billion. About a decade ago, this metric came in at just under $11 billion, reflecting an economically sustainable business.Toyota (TM)Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylightSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comShould the stock market crash, investors may want to consider adding Toyota (NYSE:TM) to their portfolio. To be fair, the Japanese auto giant raised eyebrows for not enthusiastically diving into electric vehicles. As a CNBC report noted, the “company doesn’t believe battery-electric vehicles are the only solution to producing more sustainable vehicles and achieving carbon neutrality.”Instead, Toyota effectively hedges its bets, believing that hybrid vehicles will play a significant role in the future of mobility. That’s where the eyebrow raising comes in because critics suggest that hybrids still feature combustion engines. Ultimately, that decision may not align with the broader pivot to eliminate combustion power from the transportation ecosystem.However, it’s not a given that EVs are the future, as many analysts claim. According to Kelley Blue Book data from early this year, the average price of a new EV reached nearly $63,000. Considering that the median U.S. household income probably comes in around $70,000 right now, EVs remain out of reach for many — if not most — consumers.Therefore, the hybrid approach for Toyota might make plenty of economic sense, making TM one of the stocks to buy.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comFollowing an ugly stock market crash, a reasonable wager among stocks to buy could very well be Walmart (NYSE:WMT). A big-box retailer, Walmart gained fame for its massive store size and everyday low pricing strategy. Naturally, with the wild nature of the economy and volatile global supply chains, Walmart hasn’t performed up to expectations. On a year-to-date basis, WMT slipped about 8%.Nevertheless, that’s a far better performance than the S&amp;P 500 index, which is down 21% during the same period. Colloquially, dropping 20% or more reflects the beginning of a bear market cycle. Thus, the idea of an equities sector crash is no longer theoretical. In away, the market has already already crashed.However, after the red ink sets in, WMT would be very attractive as one of the stocks to buy. While the company caters to discretionary consumer demand, Walmart is also a powerhouse in necessary household goods like food and personal care products.In addition, with the economy beaten down, consumers will look for cheaper prices. That’s really Walmart’s forte.Coinbase (COIN)The app for Coinbase (COIN) displayed on an iPhone screen.Source: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.comFinally, if the stock market does indeed melt down, the boldest of contrarians may want to pick up Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) on the cheap. Now, to be crystal clear, I don’t think it’s wise to acquire shares now because of the economic developments. Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates – effectively increasing the cost of borrowing – disincentivizes risk-on investments.Second, the so-called Merge event for the cryptocurrency sector – where a major blockchain transitioned to a more efficient consensus protocol called proof of stake – came and went without positive results for digital assets. If anything, the event was overhyped, leading to disappointed stakeholders exiting the arena. So, Coinbase, which offers wallet and exchange services for crypto participants, doesn’t represent a solid buy now.Following a stock market crash, however, COIN could be one of the more intriguing stocks to buy. Cryptos tend to follow extreme boom-bust cycles. Once sentiment becomes undeniably bearish, that may be the time to acquire shares for another (hopefully) meteoric rally.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

They also argued that Imperial is a high-priced competitor that purchases raw sugar to refine and does not compete to lower prices.They also argued that the U.S. Department of Agriculture monitors sugar prices and can increase imports if needed to address price increases.

56,ca5304be-de3e-381f-9844-d73a6f8ea7b4,PHM,2022-09-26,PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) shareholders have earned a 8.8% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-nyse-phm-shareholders-earned-124346372.html,1664109826,STORY,['PHM'],"[If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) share price is up 43% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 18% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for PulteGroup There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, PulteGroup managed to grow its earnings per share at 40% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 7% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 4.07.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how PulteGroup has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of PulteGroup, it has a TSR of 53% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that PulteGroup returned a loss of 16% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 9% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PulteGroup better, we need to consider many other factors.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Mosaic’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Mosaic Is Mosaic Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Mosaic is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $61.25, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Mosaic’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Mosaic?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Mosaic, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although MOS is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to MOS, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MOS for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study TE Connectivity's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TE Connectivity is:24% = US$2.5b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of TE Connectivity's Earnings Growth And 24% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that TE Connectivity has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE is quite impressive. However, we are curious as to how the high returns still resulted in a flat growth for TE Connectivity in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capitalStory continuesWe then compared TE Connectivity's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 17% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TEL?

Is TE Connectivity Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 29% (meaning the company retains71% of profits) in the last three-year period, TE Connectivity's earnings growth was more or les flat. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.In addition, TE Connectivity has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 24%. As a result, TE Connectivity's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 23% for future ROE.ConclusionOverall, we feel that TE Connectivity certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.You are likely not doing enough to understand the unfolding disaster that is the global stock market and economic backdrop.Chances are you have been beaten over the head by a financial advisor to ""think long-term"" and to not check stock prices daily on the nifty Yahoo Finance app. At the same time, this is a strange moment to be an investor — and the current situation demands your attention.Have you ever seen interest rates ascend so rapidly as they are now because of what the Federal Reserve is doing? Look what it's doing to the housing market, as reported by Yahoo Finance's Ronda Lee.Have you ever heard about a ""soft"" or ""hard"" economic landing so much before they became the buzziest finance terms of 2022? Fears of a hard landing are roiling energy markets, reports Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre.Ever see a company like FedEx miss on earnings estimates by more than $2 and then say it will slash almost $3 billion in costs just like that? I had choice things to say on this one last week on Yahoo Finance Live.Ever see shares of ridiculously strong tech companies such as Nvidia (down 57% YTD), AMD (down 52% YTD) and Amazon (down 32% YTD) get pulverized primarily by the outlook for interest rates?Unless you are at least 60 years old, I venture the answer is No.In any case, this moment in time calls for the all hands on deck approach.To that end, here are a few things that I am watching this week:Currency moves: Check out this fabulous analysis by our markets master Jared Blikre on the wild moves we are seeing in currencies that is impacting markets and global multinationals. ""While American tourists abroad may celebrate entire countries going 'on sale,' all sorts of investment vehicles — 401ks, institutional portfolios, corporate earnings, crypto holdings — are directly or indirectly feeling pain from of these gut-wrenching currency moves,"" Jared correctly notes. Currency moves were also an under-the-radar topic at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference I went to last week — here is what Salesforce's co-CEO Bret Taylor told me. Want to brush up on your understanding of currencies? Here is a list of good books.Story continuesA U.S. 100 dollar banknote is seen through a magnifying lens on top of 10 and 20 lira banknotes in this illustration picture taken in Istanbul January 28, 2014. REUTERS/Murad Sezer (TURKEY - Tags: BUSINESS)The tradeable stock market bottom: Stock prices don't go down forever, despite the vibe to the contrary that has enveloped markets. I liked what BTIG's technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky had to say in a new note to clients:""The good news is that in the near-term, we are much closer to a tradable bottom than we were at 3,900. Despite bearish sentiment and positioning much of this year, it's the transactional indicators that have been lacking for true capitulation. Several of those are at or near levels that suggest a bounce should be forming soon, especially as the seasonals become a tailwind in mid-October. As far as a level, while there will be some talk of a double bottom at the June lows, an undercut that gets closer to the 200- week moving average (3,585) makes sense to us.""I am watching if this plays out in the wake of last week's post-Fed meeting drubbing. If it is taking shape, I think it will be led by bounces in beat-up household name stocks such as the aforementioned AMD, Nvidia, and Amazon.I encourage you to bookmark the ""Trending Tickers"" page on Yahoo Finance, an incredibly valuable tool to sniff out bottoms and tops in markets.Krinsky added this useful chart showing that historically, the fourth quarter is good for markets as investors get in the holiday mood.Stocks yearn for October. (BTIG)Nike's earnings: Expectations on Nike's earnings report due out on Thursday have come way down in recent weeks amid 1) warnings from big companies like FedEx; 2) terrible late August earnings from retailers; 3) volatile currencies that are likely hammering Nike's sales and profits overseas. Nike's stock has come down, too — off 12% in the past month alone. Despite the much lower hurdle rate for the report, it's hard to believe that in this climate Nike's earnings will be embraced by investors. The company is likely to warn on currencies, inventory levels and demand out of China. Look for the company to cut its fiscal year currency neutral revenue guidance and for this to pressure other retail stocks. Morgan Stanley's long-time retail analyst Kimberly Greenberger appears to agree.""While the long-term opportunity remains compelling, macroeconomic deterioration and limited visibility makes current discounted valuation fair, in our view,"" Greenberger wrote in a note to clients. ""And until visibility improves, we see more attractive opportunities elsewhere in our coverage.""What to Watch TodayEconomic calendar8:30 a.m. ET: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, August (0.27 during prior month)10:30 a.m. ET: Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity Index, September (-12.0 expected, -12.9 during prior month)EarningsNo notable reports scheduled for release.

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced they have completed a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of a 10-µg booster dose of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 years of age. The request for Emergency Use Authorization of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in this age group is supported by safety and immunogenicity data from the companies’ bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccine, non-clinical and manufacturing data from the companies’ 10-µg bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted vaccine, and pre-clinical data from the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted vaccine in their decision. An application to extend the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine marketing authorization to include children ages 5 through 11 years will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the coming days.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220923005307/en/The companies have also initiated a Phase 1/2/3 study NCT05543616 (C4591048) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of different doses and dosing regimens of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months through 11 years of age. This pediatric study is consistent with regulatory guidance and follows a previous Phase 1/2/3 trial involving these age groups that demonstrated the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is well-tolerated and offers a high level of protection against COVID-19, measured at a time when the Omicron BA.2 strain was highly prevalent.The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY®) in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.Story continuesAbout the StudyThe Phase 1/2/3 pediatric clinical study will have four substudies examining different bivalent vaccine dosing regimens, dose levels and ages, including:Substudy A (Ages 6 through 23 months who are COVID-19 vaccine-naïve): Phase 1 dose-finding study will evaluate 3-µg, 6-µg, and 10-µg dose levels of the bivalent vaccine. Based on Phase 1, Participants in the Phase 2/3 will receive the selected dose as a three-dose primary series, followed by a booster dose.Substudy B (Ages 6 months through 4 years who had previously received 2-3 doses of original COVID-19 vaccine): Those who have received two doses of the original COVID-19 vaccine prior to enrollment will receive both a third and fourth 3-µg dose of the bivalent vaccine. Those who have previously received three doses of the original vaccine will receive a 3-µg booster (fourth) dose of the bivalent vaccine.Substudy C (Ages 6 months through 4 years who had previously received 3 doses of original COVID-19 vaccine): Phase 1 dose-finding study will evaluate 6-µg and 10-µg dose levels of the bivalent vaccine for a fourth dose. Based on Phase 1, Phase 2/3 will receive the selected dose as a fourth dose.Substudy D (Ages 5 through 11 years who had previously received 2-3 doses of original COVID-19 vaccine): Participants will receive the bivalent vaccine as either a third or fourth 10-µg booster dose.U.S. INDICATION &amp; AUTHORIZED USEPFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, BIVALENT (ORIGINAL AND OMICRON BA.4/BA.5) AUTHORIZED USESPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) is FDA-authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in individuals 12 years of age and older as a single booster dose administered at least 2 months after either:completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved monovalent* COVID-19 vaccine; orreceipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.*Monovalent refers to any authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccine that contains or encodes the spike protein of only the Original SARS-CoV-2 virusCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) INDICATIONCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a vaccine approved for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older.COMIRNATY® AUTHORIZED USESCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is FDA-authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to provide:Primary Seriesa third primary series dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have certain kinds of immunocompromisePFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE AUTHORIZED USESPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in individuals 6 months and older to provide:Primary Seriesa 3-dose primary series to individuals 6 months through 4 years of agea 2-dose primary series to individuals 5 years through 11 years of agea third primary series dose to individuals 5 years through 11 years of age with certain kinds of immunocompromiseBoostera single booster dose to individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccineEMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATIONEmergency uses of the original and bivalent vaccines have not been approved or licensed by FDA, but have been authorized by FDA, under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) in:individuals 6 months of age and older (original vaccine)individuals 12 years of age and older (bivalent vaccine)The emergency uses are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5), COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccineTell your vaccination provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:have any allergieshave had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart)have a feverhave a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinnerare immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects the immune systemare pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeedinghave received another COVID-19 vaccinehave ever fainted in association with an injectionCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) may not protect all vaccine recipients.You should not receive Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) if you have had a severe allergic reaction to after a previous dose of COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine or had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in these vaccinesThere is a remote chance that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospitalSeek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over the body, dizziness, and weaknessMyocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA) or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The observed risk is higher among adolescent males and adult males under 40 years of age than among females and older males, and the observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. In most of these people, symptoms began within the first week following receipt of the second primary series dose or first booster dose, with most booster doses administered at least 5 months after completing primary vaccination. The chance of having this occur is very low.Side effects that have been reported with these vaccines include:Severe allergic reactionsNon-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the faceMyocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle)Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart)Injection site painTirednessHeadacheMuscle painChillsJoint painFeverInjection site swellingInjection site rednessNauseaFeeling unwellSwollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy)Decreased appetiteDiarrheaVomitingArm painFainting in association with injection of the vaccineUnusual and persistent irritabilityUnusual and persistent poor feedingUnusual and persistent fatigue or lack of energyUnusual and persistent cool, pale skinThese may not be all the possible side effects of the vaccine.

It led to a precipitous drop in the equity indices on Thursday — marking the third consecutive day of declines and falling to lows not seen since July. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.As such, trading is expected to be choppy for the U.S. stock markets going ahead, even as investors have been witnessing extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022. Risks stemming from recession fears, geopolitical tensions and dwindling liquidity may also lead to a rough road for equities.In the current jittery market environment, for investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup, it is time to focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies.

(NASDAQ:ISRG)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-tell-story-intuitive-surgical-110034511.html,1664190034.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 47.4x Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Intuitive Surgical's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Intuitive Surgical.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Intuitive Surgical's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 13%. Regardless, EPS has managed to lift by a handy 14% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the earlier period of growth. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been mostly respectable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 18% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Intuitive Surgical's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From Intuitive Surgical's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Intuitive Surgical's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.The company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis.

However, it’s fair to bring up the academic likelihood of such a scenario panning out.According to 2016 research conducted by Chicago Booth Review contributors – including Yale professor Robert J. Shiller – market experts and retail investors “judged the likelihood of a crash as much higher than shown by historical data.”You can read the data for yourself. But in summary, “investors gave estimates of the likelihood of a crash that were more than 20 times the historical precedent.” In other words, investors may be more worried right now than necessary.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNevertheless, savvy investors can (and should) strategize around certain stocks to buy that may go on steep discount.Essentially, academic reports can only cover so much. During the new normal, we’ve incurred a pandemic, cycles of economic instability and a war on European soil. Therefore, it may be inaccurate to rely solely on number-crunching of past data to reflect future probabilities. And that opens doors for certain stocks to buy – once the red ink has been priced in.GOOG, GOOGLAlphabet$100.57, $100.12ISRGIntuitive Surgical$189.40XOMExxon Mobil$91.23NEENextEra Energy$83.44TMToyota$138.98WMTWalmart$132.98COINCoinbase$63.33Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThroughout this year, companies tied to digital advertisement campaigns sounded the alarm about demand erosion. In my view, this dynamic reflects the aforementioned economic instability. With people not sure what the future holds – inflation, deflation or something else – both consumers and businesses scaled back spending. Given these troubles and others, downside for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) presents an unsurprising storyline.Story continuesStill, let’s be clear about the fundamentals. Alphabet’s Google ecosystem effectively owns the internet. For instance, take a look at global search engine market share data. Despite intense efforts from domestic powerhouses, Google remains king of digital search. Even the best that the Russians and Chinese have to offer pales in comparison to the sheer dominance of Google.Frankly, such dominance will be difficult for anyone to usurp. Part of the reason why is that Alphabet transitioned from a mere technology firm to a cultural institution. People use the word “Google” as part of their natural, everyday lexicon. So, should a stock market crash materialize, GOOG (or GOOGL) represents one of the best stocks to buy.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWhile no one likes to see red ink splashed on their portfolio, the pain may also lead to significant gain over the long run. In other words, a stock market crash could yield opportunities that a rising bullish cycle previously denied. For contrarians, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) may be an excellent pickup should the equities sector melt down.Best known for its Da Vinci system, Intuitive Surgical specializes in minimally invasive care. According to the Mayo Clinic, some of the advantages of minimally invasive procedures include less pain, faster recovery, an earlier return to work and better cosmetic results. Perhaps one of the most important advantages is shorter hospital stays, meaning less financial and emotional burden for all involved.According to Grand View Research, revenue for the minimally invasive surgical instruments market could be $60.65 billion by 2030. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% between 2022 and 2030. Thus, the expanding addressable market for Intuitive Surgical makes ISRG one of the stocks to buy following a market crash.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comPolitically and ideologically, the idea of hydrocarbon-related investments making a list of stocks to buy became more controversial. For instance, with the advent and subsequent integration of electric vehicles in the broader transportation framework, fewer enterprises carry excuses about their emissions. Therefore, mentioning Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as a discount to pick up in a stock market crash seems anachronistic.Nevertheless, big oil firms like Exxon enjoy scientific realities. One of the advantages that hydrocarbons enjoy over intermittent renewable energy sources is a higher capacity factor. Essentially, fossil fuels feature significantly less downtime than their renewable counterparts. Therefore, they are able to emit maximum power for longer periods.On the flipside, wind becomes ineffective when the wind ceases. Solar features the same ineffectiveness when the sun sets.As well, recent geopolitical flashpoints confirm that the rest of the world still runs on hydrocarbons. That’s not going to go away in a few years’ time, most likely. Therefore, should the market implode, XOM is one of the stocks to buy.NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comAfter laying out the ongoing relevance of hydrocarbon-related stocks to buy, mentioning NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) – a specialist in renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar – represents a tough transition. Nevertheless, I think the framework that a society must be completely one side or the other is unproductive. Rather, we should be focusing on net impact. As well, various forms of energy can exist side by side.On a geopolitical scale, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions devastated hydrocarbon inflows. If a lesson is to be learned, it’s that energy diversification is critical. If one source goes down, another can help pick up the slack.Specific to NextEra Energy, the company has been able to leverage the pertinence of its underlying renewable energy sector and become a consistently profitable organization. For instance, NextEra’s retained earnings currently stands at $25.2 billion. About a decade ago, this metric came in at just under $11 billion, reflecting an economically sustainable business.Toyota (TM)Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylightSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comShould the stock market crash, investors may want to consider adding Toyota (NYSE:TM) to their portfolio. To be fair, the Japanese auto giant raised eyebrows for not enthusiastically diving into electric vehicles. As a CNBC report noted, the “company doesn’t believe battery-electric vehicles are the only solution to producing more sustainable vehicles and achieving carbon neutrality.”Instead, Toyota effectively hedges its bets, believing that hybrid vehicles will play a significant role in the future of mobility. That’s where the eyebrow raising comes in because critics suggest that hybrids still feature combustion engines. Ultimately, that decision may not align with the broader pivot to eliminate combustion power from the transportation ecosystem.However, it’s not a given that EVs are the future, as many analysts claim. According to Kelley Blue Book data from early this year, the average price of a new EV reached nearly $63,000. Considering that the median U.S. household income probably comes in around $70,000 right now, EVs remain out of reach for many — if not most — consumers.Therefore, the hybrid approach for Toyota might make plenty of economic sense, making TM one of the stocks to buy.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comFollowing an ugly stock market crash, a reasonable wager among stocks to buy could very well be Walmart (NYSE:WMT). A big-box retailer, Walmart gained fame for its massive store size and everyday low pricing strategy. Naturally, with the wild nature of the economy and volatile global supply chains, Walmart hasn’t performed up to expectations. On a year-to-date basis, WMT slipped about 8%.Nevertheless, that’s a far better performance than the S&amp;P 500 index, which is down 21% during the same period. Colloquially, dropping 20% or more reflects the beginning of a bear market cycle. Thus, the idea of an equities sector crash is no longer theoretical. In away, the market has already already crashed.However, after the red ink sets in, WMT would be very attractive as one of the stocks to buy. While the company caters to discretionary consumer demand, Walmart is also a powerhouse in necessary household goods like food and personal care products.In addition, with the economy beaten down, consumers will look for cheaper prices. That’s really Walmart’s forte.Coinbase (COIN)The app for Coinbase (COIN) displayed on an iPhone screen.Source: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.comFinally, if the stock market does indeed melt down, the boldest of contrarians may want to pick up Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) on the cheap. Now, to be crystal clear, I don’t think it’s wise to acquire shares now because of the economic developments. Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates – effectively increasing the cost of borrowing – disincentivizes risk-on investments.Second, the so-called Merge event for the cryptocurrency sector – where a major blockchain transitioned to a more efficient consensus protocol called proof of stake – came and went without positive results for digital assets. If anything, the event was overhyped, leading to disappointed stakeholders exiting the arena. So, Coinbase, which offers wallet and exchange services for crypto participants, doesn’t represent a solid buy now.Following a stock market crash, however, COIN could be one of the more intriguing stocks to buy. Cryptos tend to follow extreme boom-bust cycles. Once sentiment becomes undeniably bearish, that may be the time to acquire shares for another (hopefully) meteoric rally.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

With the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices each down 20% or more on the year and officially in a bear market, many analysts and traders are referring to this year’s downturn as a “crash.”Famed investors Michael Burry and Jeremy Grantham have each likened this year’s market decline to the dot-com and housing crashes of 2000 and 2008. They predict more pain is ahead for investors as central banks around the world raise interest rates to bring stubbornly high inflation back down to their 2% targets.The good news for individual retail investors is that there are several sturdy stocks to be found in the S&amp;P 500 index that can be purchased now at discounted prices and provide predictable future gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy during the current stock market crash.AAPLApple$152.55TSLATesla$289.38UNHUnitedHealth$517.28VVisa$185.52COSTCostco$486.84KOCoca-Cola$59.62BACBank of America$32.56Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comConsumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the biggest stock in the S&amp;P 500 index by weighting. With a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion, Apple is the biggest publicly traded company in the U.S.Prior to Covid-19, Apple’s market cap exceeded $3 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world. It is difficult to overestimate the size and scope of Apple’s influence over the S&amp;P 500 and other indices. A drop in AAPL stock can pull the entire market lower and send investors sprinting for the exits.Fortunately, Apple remains a stable, profitable and well-run company under the leadership of Tim Cook. Apple’s core electronics products, such as its iPhones, Apple Watches and MacBook computers, remain staples around the world, and are complemented by a growing number of services such as Apple TV, books and podcasts.Story continuesThe company’s enduring success is the main reason why AAPL stock is only down 14% this year, proving to be more resilient than many other technology stocks. Over the past five years, Apple’s share price has risen 300%.Tesla (TSLA)TSLA stock: Tesla Super Charging station on Stockdale Hwy and the 5 fwy. Tesla Supercharger stations allow Tesla cars to be fast-charged at the network within an hour.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.comThere are plenty of reasons for investors to remain excited about electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).While the Austin, Texas-based company has faced challenges this year in the form of regulatory investigations, renewed Covid-19 restrictions in China, and a slowdown in consumer demand, it has also achieved multiple successes. These include opening a new manufacturing plant outside Berlin, Germany, and the doubling of its vehicle sales in the U.S. Tesla remains the global market leader in the electric vehicle space, and all other automakers are rushing to catch it.In terms of the company’s stock, TSLA shares just split for the second time in as many years. On Aug. 24, Tesla split its stock on a 3-for-1 basis. This followed a 5-for-1 stock split back in August 2020. The latest split has brought the price of TSLA stock down to just under $300 a share.An 18% decline in the share price has also made the stock more affordable for retail investors. Many analysts continue to expect that Tesla will remain the global leader in EV sales for the foreseeable future given that the company allocates 19% of its gross profits to research and development (R&amp;D), enabling it to stay a few steps ahead of its competitors.UnitedHealth (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comHealthcare isn’t really subject to economic cycles. The healthcare sector is more influenced by demographics such as aging populations, as well as government regulations, prescription drug approvals, and technological advancements. As such, healthcare stocks can help a portfolio weather the ups and downs of the economy and market. One such stock is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurer in the U.S. and the biggest healthcare company in the world with annual revenues in excess of $285 billion.One of the 10 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index, UnitedHealth’s stock is up 3% this year. Over the past 12 months, UNH stock has increased 26% despite the broader downturn in equities. The size and resilience of UnitedHealth’s stock is one reason why investors should consider owning it to help them get through a stock market crash.UnitedHealth also continues to grow and get bigger. The company just secured a key approval in its efforts to acquire healthcare technology firm Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG) for $8 billion.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comWhile it hasn’t had a significant breakout in over a year, credit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) remains a dependable blue-chip stock. This year, V stock has declined 14%. But over the last five years, Visa’s stock has increased nearly 80%, and it has gained 660% during the past decade. The San Francisco-based payments company has proven that it can withstand economic and market shocks and emerge stronger on the other side.The company also has a track record of adapting to technological upheaval, which is the case now with a proliferation of competing financial technology (fintech) companies and payment apps such as Block (NYSE:SQ) and SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI).Despite competitive pressures, Visa remains the market leader among established credit card companies. In 2020, nearly half (49%) of American adults had a Visa card in their wallet, compared to 39% who owned a Mastercard and 15% who had an American Express card. Visa is also a cash cow, having generated $16 billion in free cash flow during the past year, giving it the means to withstand any stock market crash.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comBig-box retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a reliable bet in any economy. The Seattle-based company has managed to keep its 117 million cardholders renewing their memberships this year by offering lower prices for products ranging from gasoline and eye glasses to meat and vegetables.As inflation has pushed consumer prices sharply higher, people continue to turn to Costco for deals. This loyalty on the part of its customers enabled Costco, which reports its earnings on a monthly basis, to announce August sales of $17.55 billion, up 11% from a year earlier. The company’s same-store sales rose 8.7% during the month.There continues to be speculation that Costco plans to raise its membership fees to help offset the impacts of inflation. This speculation grew louder after competitor Sam’s Club announced that it is raising its basic membership fee to $50 from $45. However, so far, Costco has held its two-tier membership fees steady at $60 and $120, respectively. The company has also kept its popular $1.50 hot dog and soft drink deal intact, which has been cheered by patrons.Year to date, COST stock is down 13%.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comPeople continue drinking Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) even when the stock market is crashing. Some people may drink more Coke when they are stressed by sour market conditions. This makes KO stock a steady investment for investors to hold through market cycles.In fact, Coca-Cola’s stock is so steady that some analysts liken it to a bond. The share price never rises or falls dramatically, but inches higher over time, all the while paying a decent quarterly dividend that yields 2.95%.This year is a good example of KO stock’s even temper. Year to date, the share price is up a slight 0.7%. In the past five years, the stock has gained 32%. After seeing its sales slow in 2020 due to restaurant and venue closures because of Covid-19, Coca-Cola has come roaring back. In 2021, the Atlanta-based company’s sales rose 8% as lockdowns ended worldwide. Coca-Cola expects sales to grow a further 12% to 13% this year. Earnings per share are forecast to increase 5% to 6% for all of this year.Bank of America (BAC)Bank of America (BAC) logo on top of a retail office building.Source: 4kclips / Shutterstock.comHigher interest rates should help bolster the finances of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the second-largest lender in the U.S. In time, higher rates charged on its mortgages, lines of credit, and other loans will surely be exhibited on Bank of America’s balance sheet and in its stock price. But in the near term, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based financial institution is grappling with a slowing consumer loan business, reduced revenues from its trading and deal desks, volatile commodity prices, and growing fears of an economic recession.Those issues have helped to push BAC stock down 27% this year. But rather than fret, intrepid investors should see the pullback in BAC stock as a buying opportunity. In addition to its diminished share price, Bank of America also has a low price-earnings ratio of 10.36x and pays a dividend that yields 2.7%.History shows that bank stocks are among the first to recover when the stock market rebounds from a crash, and Bank of America shareholders should benefit from elevated interest rates over a prolonged period.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL, V and BAC.

85,db175973-5880-38f3-9cee-2eae8ba7974d,VZ,2022-09-26,"As Tropical Storm Ian approaches the US, Verizon is ready",GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tropical-storm-ian-approaches-us-120000695.html,1664193600,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCNEW YORK, Sept. 26, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Tropical Storm Ian makes its way towards the US, Verizon’s response team is readying to keep communities and first responders connected when it matters most. Teams of Verizon engineers have been actively preparing by running emergency drills, testing fiber and cell site readiness, and ensuring recovery equipment is in place from the tip of Florida, through the Gulf Coast and up the East Coast. Verizon Frontline and the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team also stand ready to provide first responders on the front lines of response efforts with the mission-critical communications support they need.Verizon’s networks are prepared to keep people connectedRecognized repeatedly for reliability, Verizon’s extreme network is designed to withstand extreme weather and delivers superior service by including redundancy on critical paths and components to avoid a potential failure of a network component significantly affecting customers. The use of battery and generator backup systems in critical locations such as macro cell sites, switch locations and network operations centers also serves to minimize the risk of disruption if commercial power is lost. 100% of Verizon macro cell sites have backup battery power and 78% have backup generators. Verizon engineers have been preparing for the coming storm by ensuring fuel levels are high on all generators at cell sites, testing battery back-ups at network facilities, positioning extra equipment in case additional capacity is needed, and prepping emergency crews to respond quickly to any network issue. These are just a few of the reasons Verizon’s network is the network America relies on, in good times and bad.In case emergency network recovery becomes necessary after Ian makes landfall, Verizon is prepared to respond quickly. Verizon maintains a fleet of over 500 portable assets, including fully functional, generator-powered cells sites that can replace or enhance network coverage and capacity in a given area as well as drones and a fixed wing aircraft that can provide service from the sky above. Additionally, Verizon boasts an industry-leading 150 satellite based portable network assets that can be used in case fiber connection is lost due to loss of commercial power or physical damage. Those assets include mid-Earth orbit and geosynchronous assets. All of those mobile assets are complemented by nearly a thousand portable generators and a comprehensive refueling program.Story continuesAre you ready for the storm? Verizon’s retail team stands ready to assist customers and ensure they have the right devices, accessories and connectivity they’ll need to weather the storm. And convenient options like locker, curbside and in store pickup provide quick ways to get what you need and get out.In addition to the right tech, you’ll also want to take steps to ensure your family is prepared for the season as well. When a storm is forecast:Keep devices dry: While many phones today are some degree of water resistant, you still want to take some extra care to ensure phones, tablets, batteries, chargers and other equipment remain dry and accessible. Plastic zipper storage bags help shield devices, and there are weatherproof phones, phone cases and other protective accessories available.Keep devices fully charged: Make sure your device is ready when you need it by keeping phone and tablet batteries fully charged in case commercial power goes out.Get some backup: When power is out for an extended period of time, portable battery packs can be a game-changer to ensure you remain connected. Don’t forget your car chargers as well in case you need to evacuate.Create a list: Keep a list of emergency numbers in your phone so that you have them if needed.Be prepared for loss: Take pictures of valuables and other important belongings for possible insurance claims. And make sure they’re uploaded to the cloud so you have a backup.Review checklists: Review the hurricane preparedness checklist, power outage checklist and other resources from the American Red Cross.Download useful apps: There are plenty of free weather, news, and safety-related apps available for download to your smartphone.Business continuity is criticalThe need for a secure, stable connection for business continuity is never more apparent than during severe weather events and other emergencies. This is especially important with today’s increasingly common hybrid-work environments, in which highly distributed and mobile workforces are reliant on remote collaboration and digital networking tools to do business across wide and local areas simultaneously.The Verizon Business portfolio of solutions provides continuity of service for customers, from SD-WAN, to advanced security tools, to cloud and edge applications and the BlueJeans by Verizon video collaboration platform, fleet management and tracking through Verizon Connect, fixed-wireless Internet for primary or backup connectivity. Verizon’s network-as-a-service strategy gives customers the flexibility to scale services as they require so that they’re ready for anything.As businesses launch their in-office and at-home hybrid operations, now is a great time to assess readiness plans ahead of storm season. Suggested steps for businesses and government organizations include:Make sure you have contact information updated and readily available for all employees, including at-home information for remote workers and branch information for satellite offices.Stress-test primary and backup networks and shore up any weak areasMake copies of insurance documents, review insurance coverages and update as appropriate.Ensure employees working from home have documented all corporate equipment being used to work from home in case of damage or loss.Ensure backup plans are in place to shift work in case work-from-home employees in a storm-impacted area have to evacuate their home or their home loses commercial power.Verizon Frontline is ready to support first responders The Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team stands ready to deploy in support of public safety agencies nationwide — at no cost to the agency — to ensure they have the mission-critical communications support they need when responding to severe weather and other crisis events. In 2021, the team deployed 84 times, to 13 states, in support of first responders on the front lines of hurricane response efforts.Composed of former first responders and military veterans, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to public safety agencies and emergency responders. The team is available 24/7 to deliver Verizon Frontline technologies including portable cell sites, drones, charging stations, WiFi hotspots, and other Verizon Frontline devices and solutions that enable communications and/or boost network performance.Verizon Frontline is the advanced network and technology built for first responders – developed over nearly three decades of partnership with public safety officials and agencies on the front lines – to meet their unique and evolving needs.After an emergency, call before you digDebris clean up and property repair are important tasks after a storm. Before beginning to clean up and make repairs, call 811 or visit call811.com to determine where fiber or other cables are buried. Contacting 811 before any digging project, large or small, is the easiest step toward reducing the chance of damaging underground fiber and keeping customers and first responders connected in critical moments. Fiber is the invisible footprint that moves data throughout Verizon’s network across the country and around the world.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.You are likely not doing enough to understand the unfolding disaster that is the global stock market and economic backdrop.Chances are you have been beaten over the head by a financial advisor to ""think long-term"" and to not check stock prices daily on the nifty Yahoo Finance app. At the same time, this is a strange moment to be an investor — and the current situation demands your attention.Have you ever seen interest rates ascend so rapidly as they are now because of what the Federal Reserve is doing? Look what it's doing to the housing market, as reported by Yahoo Finance's Ronda Lee.Have you ever heard about a ""soft"" or ""hard"" economic landing so much before they became the buzziest finance terms of 2022? Fears of a hard landing are roiling energy markets, reports Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre.Ever see a company like FedEx miss on earnings estimates by more than $2 and then say it will slash almost $3 billion in costs just like that? I had choice things to say on this one last week on Yahoo Finance Live.Ever see shares of ridiculously strong tech companies such as Nvidia (down 57% YTD), AMD (down 52% YTD) and Amazon (down 32% YTD) get pulverized primarily by the outlook for interest rates?Unless you are at least 60 years old, I venture the answer is No.In any case, this moment in time calls for the all hands on deck approach.To that end, here are a few things that I am watching this week:Currency moves: Check out this fabulous analysis by our markets master Jared Blikre on the wild moves we are seeing in currencies that is impacting markets and global multinationals. ""While American tourists abroad may celebrate entire countries going 'on sale,' all sorts of investment vehicles — 401ks, institutional portfolios, corporate earnings, crypto holdings — are directly or indirectly feeling pain from of these gut-wrenching currency moves,"" Jared correctly notes. Currency moves were also an under-the-radar topic at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference I went to last week — here is what Salesforce's co-CEO Bret Taylor told me. Want to brush up on your understanding of currencies? Here is a list of good books.Story continuesA U.S. 100 dollar banknote is seen through a magnifying lens on top of 10 and 20 lira banknotes in this illustration picture taken in Istanbul January 28, 2014. REUTERS/Murad Sezer (TURKEY - Tags: BUSINESS)The tradeable stock market bottom: Stock prices don't go down forever, despite the vibe to the contrary that has enveloped markets. I liked what BTIG's technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky had to say in a new note to clients:""The good news is that in the near-term, we are much closer to a tradable bottom than we were at 3,900. Despite bearish sentiment and positioning much of this year, it's the transactional indicators that have been lacking for true capitulation. Several of those are at or near levels that suggest a bounce should be forming soon, especially as the seasonals become a tailwind in mid-October. As far as a level, while there will be some talk of a double bottom at the June lows, an undercut that gets closer to the 200- week moving average (3,585) makes sense to us.""I am watching if this plays out in the wake of last week's post-Fed meeting drubbing. If it is taking shape, I think it will be led by bounces in beat-up household name stocks such as the aforementioned AMD, Nvidia, and Amazon.I encourage you to bookmark the ""Trending Tickers"" page on Yahoo Finance, an incredibly valuable tool to sniff out bottoms and tops in markets.Krinsky added this useful chart showing that historically, the fourth quarter is good for markets as investors get in the holiday mood.Stocks yearn for October. (BTIG)Nike's earnings: Expectations on Nike's earnings report due out on Thursday have come way down in recent weeks amid 1) warnings from big companies like FedEx; 2) terrible late August earnings from retailers; 3) volatile currencies that are likely hammering Nike's sales and profits overseas. Nike's stock has come down, too — off 12% in the past month alone. Despite the much lower hurdle rate for the report, it's hard to believe that in this climate Nike's earnings will be embraced by investors. The company is likely to warn on currencies, inventory levels and demand out of China. Look for the company to cut its fiscal year currency neutral revenue guidance and for this to pressure other retail stocks. Morgan Stanley's long-time retail analyst Kimberly Greenberger appears to agree.""While the long-term opportunity remains compelling, macroeconomic deterioration and limited visibility makes current discounted valuation fair, in our view,"" Greenberger wrote in a note to clients.

(NYSE:CMI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 83% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$29b last week after a 3.4% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 8.0% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Cummins' share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cummins. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cummins?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Cummins does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cummins, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cummins. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 4.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 24 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of CumminsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Cummins Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$136m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cummins. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

That put it below the $21.6 million forecast from Boxoffice Pro. The studio had projected sales of around $17 million.A rerelease of the 2009 blockbuster “Avatar” took in $10.5 million domestically, Comscore estimated, as Walt Disney Co. seeks to drum up interest in the sequel, “Avatar: The Way of Water,” before its debut in December.Key InsightsThe current period is a slow one for the industry as theater chains await potentially big films later this year, including “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” on Nov. 11. In the meantime, smaller-budget pictures have been competing with classic movie rereleases and foreign films as cinema owners try to fill seats.“Don’t Worry Darling” tells the story of residents in a fictional town called Victory, California, which was created and paid for by a secretive company. It’s Wilde’s second film after her 2019 directorial debut with “Booksmart,” and stars Florence Pugh and Harry Styles. It has a 38% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, though 80% of moviegoers said they liked it. It was made for $35 million. “We’re enormously proud of this film and are pleased with these results given our modest production budget,” Warner Bros. said in a statement.The movie, which was made under Warner Bros.’ New Line Cinema label, was the subject of unusually intense press coverage before its premiere. One of its stars, Shia LaBeouf, was fired and replaced with Styles, according to Wilde. LaBeouf accused her of lying, saying he quit, while others have speculated a rift also developed between the director and Pugh.The audience for “Don’t Worry Darling” was 66% female, most of them over 18 years old, the studio said. “The Woman King,” a Sony Group movie about a female-led group of African warriors, which opened in first place last weekend, took the No. 2 spot.

After the stock price dropped 7.8% last week, the company's market value declined by US$12b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Comcast The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ComcastThe Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$397k worth of shares at a price of US$44.50 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$31.84). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Daniel Murdock was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$1.2b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Comcast Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Comcast insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Comcast insiders selling.

However, the 88% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses.

However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Devon Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Devon Energy is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance.

It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Devon Energy. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Pharmaceutical stocks rely primarily on governments and health insurers for their revenue, neither of which is overly affected by recessions. As a result, the shares of successful drugmakers can soar in good times and bad.Then there are the companies that become more popular with some consumers during recessions. Also known as “trade-down” stocks, fast food chains and deep-discount retailers fall into this category.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinally, there are companies that sell products that most consumers, companies and governments will find necessary even during recessions, such as energy and cybersecurity.Here are seven stocks to buy regardless of where the economy is headed.LLYEli Lilly$311.32MCDMcDonald’s$247.91GSKGlaxoSmithKline$30.02DLTRDollar Tree$139.33DGDollar General$240.25LNGCheniere Energy$166.29FTNTFortinet$48.74Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comThe broader market may be in the bear’s grips, but pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) isn’t. Shares are up 34% over the past year. The company has many successful drugs that treat ailments such as diabetes, psoriasis and breast cancer. But perhaps the one that holds the most promise is the company’s potential obesity drug.Tirzepatide, which is marketed as Mounjaro, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat diabetes back in May after clinical data showed it lowered blood sugar levels and led to weight loss. The market for diabetes treatment is large, but the market for a successful weight loss treatment could be astronomical. Eli Lily is currently conducting studies on Mounjaro as a weight-loss treatment.Story continuesUBS analyst Colin Bristow upgraded LLY stock to a “buy” from “neutral” based on the potential of Mounjaro. Per Barron’s:Bristow’s thesis is simple: Treating 1.6 million Americans annually would equate to $20 billion in U.S. sales. And that is still less than 2% of the estimated obese population in the U.S., he said. Usage is likely to be higher partly because the drug has strong trial results and a favorable position in terms of competition, he said, noting that management said on an earnings call that demand is robust.It’s possible Eli Lilly has one of the most lucrative drugs of all time on its hands. I don’t expect the stock to have any problem continuing to outperform.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockA few weeks ago, I identified McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) as a stock that will benefit from the “trade-down” phenomenon during a recession. MCD “is a good defensive stock because many working-class and middle-class families will start eating there instead of more expensive restaurants if the economy turns south,” I wrote.I’m far from the only one bullish on the fast food chain.On Aug. 26, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said he sees shares hitting the $300 level, which is about 20% above the current share price. And he’s not even the most optimistic of the bunch. Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth recently upped his price target to $320, implying nearly 30% upside. Per The Fly, Feinseth said McDonald’s “reinvests its cash flow in new growth initiatives and enhances shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases.”Anecdotally, I remember that, in the 1990s and early 2000s, many members of Generation X and Generation Y with whom I was acquainted refused to eat McDonald’s food. But since around 2009, I’ve noticed that the company’s offerings have become accepted by more people in those generations, and the chain is popular among millennials. When I go to McDonald’s restaurants, they are often quite crowded.Also noteworthy is that, during the second quarter, McDonald’s global comparable sales soared 9.7% year over year.MCD stock is up 3% over the past year compared with a loss of 13% for the S&amp;P 500. I believe shares will continue to perform well in both good and bad economic times.GSK (GSK)A GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) office in London.Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.comGSK (NYSE:GSK), formerly GlaxoSmithKline, has more than 100 approved products across 80-plus markets, along with a promising pipeline with more than 60 drugs and vaccines in development.GSK has seen great success with its blockbuster shingles vaccine Shingrix, which provides more than eight years of protection against the virus, according to the company. Speaking at a recent industry conference, Roger Connor, president of GSK Vaccines, said that 33 million Americans have received at least one dose of Shingrix. But with 120 million people in the U.S. over the age of 50, and thus recommended to get the vaccine, Connor said the company is “still only scratching the surface” of the available market in the U.S. Meanwhile, GSK is distributing Shingrix in 24 countries and plans to raise that number to 35 by 2024, according to Connor.On the oncology front, GSK has two very promising drugs. The first is Zejula for ovarian cancer. Earlier this month, GSK released positive results from a Phase 3 trial. The company said it “maintained a clinically significant risk reduction of progression or death of 48% compared to placebo” after a median time period of 3.5 years among patients with HRD biomarkers.The second drug is Dostarlimab, sold under the brand name Jemperli, which has been approved to treat mismatch repair-deficient recurrent or advanced solid tumors. These are most often associated with endometrial, colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers.As I wrote recently, a small study showed that 100% of the 12 rectal cancer patients who completed treatment with Dostarlimab went into remission. This success rate is extremely unusual for a cancer drug. Larger studies are obviously needed, but the potential for a highly effective cancer treatment is a good reason for investors to keep their eye on GSK stock.Dollar Tree (DLTR)store front of a Dollar Tree location with green signageSource: shutterstock.com/Jonathan WeissSo-called “dollar store” operators always get a lot of attention when the economy is struggling, for obvious reasons. There are actually two of them on today’s list of stocks to buy, the first being Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).Shares are up 62% over the past year despite a sharp sell-off over the past month following the release of the company’s second-quarter results. Revenue increased nearly 7% year over year to $6.8 billion, while same-store sales increased 7.5%. And earnings of $1.60 per share beat analyst estimates by a penny. However, management reduced its guidance for the full year, citing a focus on offering more competitive pricing at its Family Dollar stores.Despite its reduced outlook, Dollar Tree has felt the love from analysts. On Sept. 6, JPMorgan’s Matthew Boss reiterated his “overweight” rating and raised his price target for shares to $176 from $171. Boss noted that the stock looks undervalued based on its historical forward price-to-earnings ratio.Meanwhile, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli said the post-earnings sell-off looks overdone. And despite lowering his price target to $168 from $178, he recommended investors be “aggressive buyers” of DLTR stock.Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDollar General (NYSE:DG) CEO Todd Vasos made headlines earlier this month when he said that more of the retailer’s customers have been higher-earning individuals who make between $75,000 and $100,000 a year. These middle-income and wealthier shoppers are feeling the sting of inflation as well and looking to cut costs.Wall Street analysts have been beating the drums for DG stock. Citing solid Q1 and Q2 results, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai called it “one of the few stable retailers in a rocky retail backdrop.”Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman called DG his “preferred stock in the Dollar Store space” and upped his price target to $270 from $250. The new target implies 12% upside from current levels. Per The Fly: “The company’s 10.5% EPS growth suggest[s] Dollar General is benefiting from the macro backdrop, including from trade down, while execution on initiatives and solid margin control reinforce what he sees as safety in his estimates, Gutman tells investors.”Dollar General’s shares are up significantly less than Dollar Tree’s over the past year at around 9%. But this underperformance could mean shares have more room to run. They certainly look undervalued, trading at just 1.6 times sales.Cheniere Energy (LNG)Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.comCheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) is the top U.S. liquefied natural gas exporter. As I wrote in a previous column, it is extremely well-positioned to benefit from sky-high natural gas prices in Europe. Although the eurozone is almost certainly heading for a recession, energy demand is not likely to be affected much and could very well rise as the region looks to transition to electric vehicles.Also boding well for investors, the company recently said it expects to generate over $20 billion of available cash through 2026 and distributable cash flow of more than $20 per share on a run-rate basis.Cheniere continues to add new infrastructure that will allow it to export much more liquefied natural gas over the long term. Despite its strong positive catalysts and the 90% gain in LNG stock over the past 12 months, shares have a forward P/E ratio of just 10.8.Fortinet (FTNT)The Fortinet logo on a wallSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGiven the huge legal bills and negative publicity that large-scale cybersecurity attacks bring, most companies are unlikely to cut their cybersecurity budgets much, if at all, during a recession. Uber (NYSE:UBER) was the latest big company to get hacked. Meanwhile, governments, which as I noted previously, are largely immune to recessions, are also spending a great deal of money on cybersecurity.This makes Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) a good stock to buy for investors who are looking for names that can thrive during economic downturns.On Sept. 17, MKM Partners analyst Catharine Trebnick initiated coverage of FTNT stock with a “buy” rating and a $70 price target. That’s 44% above the current share price. Trebnick notes that Fortinet has a number of competitive advantages, including the ability to monitor network traffic across multiple devices. She forecasts its billings could reach $10 billion by 2025.While FTNT stock is down 19% over the past year, shares are unlikely to remain in a downtrend for much longer.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:UPS) stock at an average price of US$192 per share allowing them to get the most out of their money. The company's market worth decreased by US$11b over the past week after the stock price dropped 7.0%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceThe Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Warren, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$192 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$164. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. Kevin Warren was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).United Parcel Service Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at United Parcel Service. In total, Executive VP &amp; Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Warren sold US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does United Parcel Service Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. United Parcel Service insiders own 0.08% of the company, currently worth about US$113m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About United Parcel Service Insiders?An insider sold United Parcel Service shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since United Parcel Service is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

(NASDAQ:ULTA). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$446 and falling to the lows of US$372. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ulta Beauty's current trading price of US$392 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ulta Beauty’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty What's The Opportunity In Ulta Beauty?Good news, investors! Ulta Beauty is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $572.67, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Ulta Beauty’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Ulta Beauty generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 7.8% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Ulta Beauty, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since ULTA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ULTA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ULTA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

With the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices each down 20% or more on the year and officially in a bear market, many analysts and traders are referring to this year’s downturn as a “crash.”Famed investors Michael Burry and Jeremy Grantham have each likened this year’s market decline to the dot-com and housing crashes of 2000 and 2008. They predict more pain is ahead for investors as central banks around the world raise interest rates to bring stubbornly high inflation back down to their 2% targets.The good news for individual retail investors is that there are several sturdy stocks to be found in the S&amp;P 500 index that can be purchased now at discounted prices and provide predictable future gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy during the current stock market crash.AAPLApple$152.55TSLATesla$289.38UNHUnitedHealth$517.28VVisa$185.52COSTCostco$486.84KOCoca-Cola$59.62BACBank of America$32.56Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comConsumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the biggest stock in the S&amp;P 500 index by weighting. With a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion, Apple is the biggest publicly traded company in the U.S.Prior to Covid-19, Apple’s market cap exceeded $3 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world. It is difficult to overestimate the size and scope of Apple’s influence over the S&amp;P 500 and other indices. A drop in AAPL stock can pull the entire market lower and send investors sprinting for the exits.Fortunately, Apple remains a stable, profitable and well-run company under the leadership of Tim Cook. Apple’s core electronics products, such as its iPhones, Apple Watches and MacBook computers, remain staples around the world, and are complemented by a growing number of services such as Apple TV, books and podcasts.Story continuesThe company’s enduring success is the main reason why AAPL stock is only down 14% this year, proving to be more resilient than many other technology stocks. Over the past five years, Apple’s share price has risen 300%.Tesla (TSLA)TSLA stock: Tesla Super Charging station on Stockdale Hwy and the 5 fwy. Tesla Supercharger stations allow Tesla cars to be fast-charged at the network within an hour.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.comThere are plenty of reasons for investors to remain excited about electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).While the Austin, Texas-based company has faced challenges this year in the form of regulatory investigations, renewed Covid-19 restrictions in China, and a slowdown in consumer demand, it has also achieved multiple successes. These include opening a new manufacturing plant outside Berlin, Germany, and the doubling of its vehicle sales in the U.S. Tesla remains the global market leader in the electric vehicle space, and all other automakers are rushing to catch it.In terms of the company’s stock, TSLA shares just split for the second time in as many years. On Aug. 24, Tesla split its stock on a 3-for-1 basis. This followed a 5-for-1 stock split back in August 2020. The latest split has brought the price of TSLA stock down to just under $300 a share.An 18% decline in the share price has also made the stock more affordable for retail investors. Many analysts continue to expect that Tesla will remain the global leader in EV sales for the foreseeable future given that the company allocates 19% of its gross profits to research and development (R&amp;D), enabling it to stay a few steps ahead of its competitors.UnitedHealth (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comHealthcare isn’t really subject to economic cycles. The healthcare sector is more influenced by demographics such as aging populations, as well as government regulations, prescription drug approvals, and technological advancements. As such, healthcare stocks can help a portfolio weather the ups and downs of the economy and market. One such stock is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurer in the U.S. and the biggest healthcare company in the world with annual revenues in excess of $285 billion.One of the 10 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index, UnitedHealth’s stock is up 3% this year. Over the past 12 months, UNH stock has increased 26% despite the broader downturn in equities. The size and resilience of UnitedHealth’s stock is one reason why investors should consider owning it to help them get through a stock market crash.UnitedHealth also continues to grow and get bigger. The company just secured a key approval in its efforts to acquire healthcare technology firm Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG) for $8 billion.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comWhile it hasn’t had a significant breakout in over a year, credit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) remains a dependable blue-chip stock. This year, V stock has declined 14%. But over the last five years, Visa’s stock has increased nearly 80%, and it has gained 660% during the past decade. The San Francisco-based payments company has proven that it can withstand economic and market shocks and emerge stronger on the other side.The company also has a track record of adapting to technological upheaval, which is the case now with a proliferation of competing financial technology (fintech) companies and payment apps such as Block (NYSE:SQ) and SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI).Despite competitive pressures, Visa remains the market leader among established credit card companies. In 2020, nearly half (49%) of American adults had a Visa card in their wallet, compared to 39% who owned a Mastercard and 15% who had an American Express card. Visa is also a cash cow, having generated $16 billion in free cash flow during the past year, giving it the means to withstand any stock market crash.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comBig-box retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a reliable bet in any economy. The Seattle-based company has managed to keep its 117 million cardholders renewing their memberships this year by offering lower prices for products ranging from gasoline and eye glasses to meat and vegetables.As inflation has pushed consumer prices sharply higher, people continue to turn to Costco for deals. This loyalty on the part of its customers enabled Costco, which reports its earnings on a monthly basis, to announce August sales of $17.55 billion, up 11% from a year earlier. The company’s same-store sales rose 8.7% during the month.There continues to be speculation that Costco plans to raise its membership fees to help offset the impacts of inflation. This speculation grew louder after competitor Sam’s Club announced that it is raising its basic membership fee to $50 from $45. However, so far, Costco has held its two-tier membership fees steady at $60 and $120, respectively. The company has also kept its popular $1.50 hot dog and soft drink deal intact, which has been cheered by patrons.Year to date, COST stock is down 13%.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comPeople continue drinking Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) even when the stock market is crashing. Some people may drink more Coke when they are stressed by sour market conditions. This makes KO stock a steady investment for investors to hold through market cycles.In fact, Coca-Cola’s stock is so steady that some analysts liken it to a bond. The share price never rises or falls dramatically, but inches higher over time, all the while paying a decent quarterly dividend that yields 2.95%.This year is a good example of KO stock’s even temper. Year to date, the share price is up a slight 0.7%. In the past five years, the stock has gained 32%. After seeing its sales slow in 2020 due to restaurant and venue closures because of Covid-19, Coca-Cola has come roaring back. In 2021, the Atlanta-based company’s sales rose 8% as lockdowns ended worldwide. Coca-Cola expects sales to grow a further 12% to 13% this year. Earnings per share are forecast to increase 5% to 6% for all of this year.Bank of America (BAC)Bank of America (BAC) logo on top of a retail office building.Source: 4kclips / Shutterstock.comHigher interest rates should help bolster the finances of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the second-largest lender in the U.S. In time, higher rates charged on its mortgages, lines of credit, and other loans will surely be exhibited on Bank of America’s balance sheet and in its stock price. But in the near term, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based financial institution is grappling with a slowing consumer loan business, reduced revenues from its trading and deal desks, volatile commodity prices, and growing fears of an economic recession.Those issues have helped to push BAC stock down 27% this year. But rather than fret, intrepid investors should see the pullback in BAC stock as a buying opportunity. In addition to its diminished share price, Bank of America also has a low price-earnings ratio of 10.36x and pays a dividend that yields 2.7%.History shows that bank stocks are among the first to recover when the stock market rebounds from a crash, and Bank of America shareholders should benefit from elevated interest rates over a prolonged period.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL, V and BAC.

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-waste-management-110020156.html,1664190020,STORY,['WM'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.44bUS$2.67bUS$2.88bUS$3.32bUS$3.57bUS$3.78bUS$3.96bUS$4.11bUS$4.24bUS$4.37bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.58%Est @ 5.89%Est @ 4.71%Est @ 3.88%Est @ 3.3%Est @ 2.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.1%– 1.9%) = US$108bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$108b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$60bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$85b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$166, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.974. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.

DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Stryker, we've put together three important aspects you should further research:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for Stryker (1 is potentially serious!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does SYK's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

This can be done by selecting great dividend stocks that also represent deep value. These stocks, in our view, provide a one-two punch of not only a strong income stream but the potential for a significant amount of capital appreciation as well.The following three dividend champions are undervalued, and also have high dividend yields leading to high total return potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSYKStryker$209.55DOVDover Corporation$120.17PIIPolaris$102.10Stryker (SYK)The Stryker (SYK) office in Fremont, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comStryker (NYSE:SYK) is a global leader in the medical device sector. The company’s product lines include surgical equipment, neurovascular products and orthopedic implants.The company has continued to generate growth in 2022, even in a difficult macroeconomic environment. In the most recent quarter, Stryker’s revenue grew 4.6% to $4.49 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.25 was flat year-over-year (YOY). Organic revenue was up 6.1% from the prior year. MedSurg and neurotechnology had 7.9% organic growth. Mako continues to have a growing install base as installations grew 19%. Orthopedics and spine grew 3.9% due to gains in procedure volumes in Europe, Canada, India and Japan.Stryker provided updated guidance for 2022 as well. The company now expects organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, up from 6% to 8% previously. Stryker now projects adjusted EPS will be in a range of $9.30 to $9.50 for the year.Stryker has grown EPS at a rate of 11.6% per year in the past 10 years. It is likely the company can continue 10%+ annual earnings growth due to increased demand for Stryker’s products during the recovery from the pandemic.Story continuesStryker has increased its dividend at an average rate of almost 12% per year over the past 10 years, though that growth has slowed somewhat in the medium term. The company raised its dividend by 10.3% for the Jan. 31, 2022 payment. It has now increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years. Shares currently yield 1.3%.Based off of estimates for 2022, shares trades at 22.1 times earnings. We reaffirm our 2027 target price-earnings (P/E) of 24.5 to be more in line with the average valuation since 2012. If shares reverted to our target price-earnings ratio by 2027, then valuation would be an approximately 2% tailwind to annual returns over this time period. Overall, total returns could exceed 13% from EPS growth, dividends and an expanding P/E multiple.Dover Corporation (DOV)The logo for Dover (DOV) displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comDover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) is a diversified global industrial manufacturer with annual revenues of nearly $9 billion. Dover is composed of five reporting segments: engineered systems, clean energy and fueling, pumps and process solutions, imaging and identification, and climate and sustainability technologies. Slightly more than half of revenues come from the U.S., with the remainder coming from international markets.On Aug. 5, 2021, Dover announced that it was raising its dividend 1% for the Sept. 15, 2021 payment, marking 66 consecutive years of dividend growth. This is the second-longest dividend growth streak among U.S. companies. Shares currently yield 1.6%.The company is effectively managing inflation, while continuing to grow revenue. In the most recent quarter, revenue grew 6.4% to $2.16 billion, while adjusted EPS grew 3.9% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14. Organic revenue remains high, with the company seeing a 7% increase in the second quarter. Engineered products increased 19% organically, as waste handling, vehicle services, and industrial winches and automation continue to see high demand. Dover’s backlog grew 30% YOY to $3.3 billion, implying continued growth in the coming quarters.Dover reaffirmed guidance for 2022. Adjusted EPS are expected in a range of $8.45 to $8.65 with revenue projected to grow 8% to 10%. Dover also raised its organic growth forecast to 8% to 10% from 7% to 9% previously, indicating positive momentum to close out the year.Dover’s EPS have compounded at 6% annually over the last decade. Growth has accelerated in the medium term, at an annual rate of more than 14% over the five years. Dover did suffer some setbacks during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the company has quickly rebounded. We maintain our expected earnings growth rate of 8% per year through 2027. The stock also appears to be undervalued, leading to total estimated returns above 13% per year over the next five years.Polaris (PII)A close-up shot of a Polaris (PII) all terrain vehicle.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPolaris (NYSE:PII) designs, engineers and manufactures snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and motorcycles. In addition, related accessories and replacement parts are sold with these vehicles through dealers located throughout the U.S. The company operates under 30+ brands including Polaris, Ranger, RZR, Sportsman, Indian Motorcycle, Slingshot and Transamerican Auto Parts. The global powersports maker, serving over 100 countries, generated $8.2 billion in sales in 2021.Like many global manufacturers, Polaris is seeing elevated costs due to inflation, which is crimping margins. Fortunately, revenue continues to grow. In the most recent quarter, revenue grew 8% to $2.06 billion, while adjusted EPS declined 10% YOY. Still, the adjusted EPS figure of $2.42 for the quarter was 30 cents ahead of expectations. Marine and off-road segments grew 38% and 7%, respectively, to lead the way last quarter.Supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures impacted results are being offset by higher prices. Polaris also provided revised guidance for 2022. For this year, the company now expects revenue to grow 13% to 16%. Adjusted EPS is now projected in a range of $10.10 to $10.30. This should easily cover the dividend and allow for continued dividend growth even while EPS stagnates.Polaris has increased its dividend for 26 consecutive years. With a projected dividend payout ratio of 25% for 2022, the dividend payout seems secure. Polaris enjoys a competitive advantage through its brand names, low-cost production, and long history in its various industries, allowing the company to be the leader in ATVs and number two in snowmobiles and domestic motorcycles. This means Polaris can remain profitable, even during difficult operating environments.The combination of 4% annual expected EPS growth, the 2.3% dividend yield and a significant boost from an expanding P/E multiple could fuel 13% expected annual returns over the next five years.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

ATO, National Fuel Gas Co. NFG and   Resources Corp. NJR.Industry: Gas DistributionLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1984182/4-gas-distribution-stocks-to-watch-in-a-promising-industryThe production of natural gas in the United States is likely to increase year over year in 2022 per the latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) and continue driving stocks in the Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry. The distribution companies offer services to transport natural gas from the region of production to millions of consumers across the United States.Sempra Energy, with its widespread natural gas infrastructure and systematic investments in infrastructure development projects, is poised to benefit as natural gas production volumes are expected to increase in the 2022-2023 time period. Steady investments and expanding infrastructure in key production regions should drive the performance of Atmos Energy Corp., National Fuel Gas Co. and NewJersey Resources Corp.About the IndustryThe shale revolution has substantially increased natural gas production. Its clean-burning nature is steadily boosting demand for natural gas in the electric power, industrial, commercial and residential markets. Natural Gas distribution pipelines play a vital role in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines.The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 3 million miles of pipeline that ensures a steady supply to millions of customers. The concerns for the distribution industry are aging infrastructure and increasing investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. In addition, competition from other clean sources of energy can lower the demand for natural gas, consequently pushing down demand for pipelines.Story continuesFactors Shaping the Future of the Gas Distribution IndustryProduction and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the EIA indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow 3.8% year over year to 97.09 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2022 and 3.4% year over year to 100.36 Bcf/d in 2023. EIA also expects U.S. natural gas consumption to increase 4.33% in 2022 to 86.56 Bcf/d due to higher consumption from all customer groups, while 2023 consumption is expected to drop by 2.2% to 84.63 Bcf/d due to the expectation of milder winter temperature and lower consumption from the residential and commercial customer group.EIA expects U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase 12.8% year over year to 11.01 Bcf/d in 2022. EIA expects LNG export volumes to increase 12.1% to 12.34 Bcf/d in 2023. The higher production and export volumes will definitely increase the usage and demand for natural gas pipelines in the United States.Aging Distribution Infrastructure: The existing U.S. natural gas distribution pipelines are aging. Leakage or breakage in these old cast iron and bare steel pipelines may result in disruption of services. At present, natural gas distribution utilities provide services to over 75 million residential and 5 million commercial customers in the United States.Per a report from Business Roundtable, replacing the old pipelines will cost around $270 billion. To lower the possibility of interruption in services, the Department of Energy announced $33 million funding for 10 projects involved in natural gas pipeline retrofitting to rehabilitate existing old cast iron and bare steel pipes.  The Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement or the REPAIR program will ensure the minimum extension of the service life of distribution pipelines by 50 years and lower the replacement cost of old pipelines by nearly 10 to 20 times per mile.At present, pipe excavation and replacement costs can go up to $10 million per mile. The rising interest rates will increase the overall project financing cost for the utilities compared with what these companies have enjoyed in the past two years.Scope for Fresh Investments: The clean-burning nature and wide availability across the United States are driving the demand for natural gas. The distribution network should continue to play a major role in transporting natural gas to nearly 75 million customers in all parts of the United States. The demand from the rising natural gas customer volume and usage of natural gas to produce electricity will play a pivotal role in the utilities’ gradual transition toward clean energy.With LNG export volumes rising each year and three new LNG export terminals are being developed in the United States, which will increase demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals. Per EIA, once completed, the three new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 5.7 Bcf/d by 2025. As production and demand for natural gas are increasing, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the natural gas to end-users, which will create new growth opportunities for natural gas pipeline operators.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.The Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry — a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector — currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #159, which places it in the top 22% of the 251 Zacks industries.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble Procter &amp; Gamble Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Jon Moeller, for US$4.5m worth of shares, at about US$149 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$136. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Procter &amp; Gamble insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Procter &amp; Gamble Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Procter &amp; Gamble shares. In total, insiders sold US$26m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$213m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Procter &amp; Gamble Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Procter &amp; Gamble stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Procter &amp; Gamble makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

As long as Fed Chair Jerome Powell keeps hiking interest rates aggressively, it seems that the market will be under further pressure. Indexes took another sharp turn lower this week following the latest Fed move, and there’s no pause in sight yet.Pundits are focused primarily on inflation and macroeconomic conditions at the moment. And that’s understandable. However, when the stock market falls this far this fast, investors willing to step into the arena can grab some compelling opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s be clear, there’s no sign that the S&amp;P 500 is set to bottom in the near term, so there is some risk in these S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip.Chair Powell made it very clear in his speech this week that inflation remains persistently too high and that the Fed has a ways to go in reining in inflation. The current market struggles could easily persist into 2023.But at some point, the reward outweighs risk in the case of these S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip. This may not be the ultimate bottom, but shares are cheap enough in these seven high-quality S&amp;P 500 stocks to set up a high probability of success for investors putting money to work today.HDHome Depot$268.91NKENike$99.16NFLXNetflix$236.36MMM3M$114.37SHWSherwin-Williams $209.73ECLEcolab$150.20INTCIntel $28.19Home Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny daySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLeading building materials and home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has seen shares tumble in 2022, with HD stock down 35% year-to-date, making it a prime candidate among S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip.Investors are dumping HD on expectations that the slowing housing market will be a big problem for the company.In theory, that makes sense. In practice, it’s not really the case. For one thing, HD stock actually held up relatively well during the 2008 financial crisis, despite that crisis’ epicenter being in the housing market. While new home construction collapsed in 2008, people kept spending on their existing homes.Story continuesHome Depot should be under even less stress this cycle.People took up hobbies, such as gardening, during the pandemic which will drive ongoing sales at Home Depot going forward. Additionally, long-term demographics continue to support more new households.The millennial generation is looking to improve their living conditions and will be buying home-related goods sooner or later. All that to say that while Home Depot may have soft earnings for 2023, the longer-term outlook will be fine, meanwhile, shares have gotten hammered this year.Nike (NKE)a stack of red Nike shoe boxesSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) stock ticked below the $100 mark following the latest Fed rate hike; shares are now down 40% year-to-date.Traders are dumping the name as the consumer spending boom fades, the Chinese apparel market remains troubled and inflationary issues have pressured profit margins. Of course, this sets NKE up as one of the surprise S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip.To that point, analysts see Nike’s earnings dropping 12% to $3.75 per share in its 2023 fiscal year, putting the stock at 26x forward earnings, but then things improve sharply.The analyst consensus has earnings jumping 22% in 2024 and another 20% in 2025, taking NKE stock to just 22x and 18x earnings in those years, respectively. That’s a bargain!This is a classic example of a great business and brand that has gotten overly punished in the short term for the current economic mess. For long-term investors, however, this is a great entry point into the world’s most well-known athletic apparel brand.Netflix (NFLX)The Netflix logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comIt’s been an absolutely dreadful year for the streaming media industry. In 2020 and 2021, people signed up for streaming subscriptions at elevated rates as the pandemic closed off other entertainment alternatives. This year, though, we’ve seen the flip side of that.As real-world entertainment venues reopen, streaming businesses such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have seen new sign-ups slow down while existing subscriber churn rates have climbed.That’s not the only problem, either. There’s been a so-called “race to the bottom” effect in streaming. The rash of new streaming services has created a ton of competition and made it hard for existing players to raise prices.As every media company seemingly rolls out its own streaming service, it also drives up the prices to make new content and fragments the existing marketplace.Over time, these issues should resolve themselves. Weaker streaming services will merge with each other or shut down. And the long-term growth of streaming should continue, as it inexorably takes customers from traditional television and cable offerings. As long as Netflix remains the leader in the market, its always going to be one of the S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip.3M Company (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com3M (NYSE:MMM) is an industrial powerhouse making a vast array of products for fields as diverse as packaging materials, workplace safety, dental instruments, and healthcare software among many others.Shares are down 35% year-to-date, which is an outsized move for a stable blue chip company sort of this one. Traders are dumping the stock around fears relating to product liability for defective earplugs.While headline legal liability seems huge, the actual expense to 3M is likely to be far smaller, as usually happens with these sorts of lawsuit situations.Meanwhile, the company is a great growth and income investment at an unusually cheap price. It’s a dividend king, having raised its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years.MMM stock’s dividend yield has now topped 5% with the heavy sell-off in recent months. With shares at their lowest point since 2013, this is a rare deep-value opportunity among S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comSherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) is one of the dominant players in the paint market. Paint may not be a glamorous business, but it is always in demand.There’s a perception that SHW stock is vulnerable thanks to the fall in the housing market. However, a huge chunk of paint consumption is for existing structures rather than just new buildings.Sherwin-Williams also has a strong competitive moat. The company has fostered close relationships with professional painters, who rely on Sherwin-Williams for its better quality products and strong customer service.By being the paint that the pros pick, this tends to ensure steady product demand and insulate the company from cheaper rivals.Sherwin-Williams has been a tremendous long-term performer. It has generated double-digital annualized earnings growth for many years and earned a high P/E ratio to correspond with its track record of success. With the stock down 40% year-to-date, Sherwin-Williams is easily among the S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip.Ecolab (ECL)Ecolab (ECL) logo on its corporate headquarters building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comEcolab (NYSE:ECL) is far and away the world’s leader in providing sanitation, hygiene, and water treatment services.However, the market remains highly fragmented. Ecolab is the number one player but has only an estimated 8% share of the total global addressable market. Its next nearest competitor, Diversey (NASDAQ:DSEY) has just a 2% share.This gives Ecolab an enviable position. It can keep acquiring smaller hygiene and sanitation companies around the world, adding more growth to its overall platform. Ecolab targets 15% annualized earnings growth over the longer term and has a massive runway for achieving that rate for many years to come.In the short-term, ECL stock got hammered thanks to the pandemic. Leading customers such as hotels and restaurant chains needed (and could afford to pay for) far fewer services from Ecolab.As the global economy reopens and travel and hospitality pick up, Ecolab should enjoy a strong reopening surge that is not currently accounted for in ECL’s stock price.Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comSemiconductors are historically a boom/bust sector. That trend is playing out again now.Companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) enjoyed record sales in 2021 as consumers stocked up on new computers and household electronics to work and study at home. Now, the market is dramatically oversupplied and sales in the industry have slumped.INTC stock has gotten absolutely clobbered, falling to multi-year lows. The company’s last quarterly earnings report was a total mess, and things don’t look much better over the next few quarters either.However, for patient investors, this is a golden opportunity. Intel remains a dominant player in semiconductors, with its $15 billion annual R&amp;D budget giving it tremendous resources for innovation and new product development.On top of that, the Biden Administration’s bill to support the semiconductor industry should provide Intel with ample assistance as it ramps up its U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Intel is a leading company in a vital industry whose share price has fallen too far amid admittedly terrible short-term industry conditions.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ECL, NKE, MMM, and INTC stock.

That makes the live-streaming platform operator among the most shorted US stocks among companies with market values of $2 billion or more.The bets show just how wary -- and selective -- investors have become as it relates to putting money into the Chinese tech sector as the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index sinks about 30% this year. The stock is under pressure even after Beijing’s yearlong regulatory clampdown eased, in part because investors are concerned that Bilibili won’t become profitable any time soon given that advertising spending is weakening along with the slowing economy. Bilibili closed 1.6% lower on Friday.“This market reaction makes sense in the current environment where cost of capital is rising and investors are no longer willing to assume these companies turn profitable and grow profits in the distant future, especially with regulatory tightening and difficult economic conditions in China,” said Louis Lau, a portfolio manager at Brandes Investment Partners LP.Bilibili stands out when it comes to Chinese firms traded in the US. In 2021, it reported the biggest net loss among the 65 members of the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index. During the second quarter, it was one of the few Chinese internet companies that missed analyst expectations. That prompted brokerages including Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG to slash target price forecasts, citing the impact of a slowing economy on the bottom line.Story continuesThe firm is among a slew of unprofitable Chinese companies in the social media and entertainment sectors. These high cash burners have expanded aggressively thank to years of cheap capital. Now, the weakening economy isn’t just hurting the ability to raise cash, it’s also slowing consumer spending and hurting online advertising, which contributed one-quarter of Bilibili’s revenues last year.“The pace of profitability could be slower than the market expects, with weaker cost discipline and slower growth for ads and games,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Alex Poon wrote in a Sept. 9 note on Bilibili. The brokerage also slashed its price target by 12%, citing high cash burn.Beyond Bilibili, investors are also counting some other Chinese firms as good short bets. Short bets on online property agent platform Ke Holdings Inc. and social media platform Zhihu Inc. spiked this month. Both firms have been unprofitable for the last two years, and fund managers are now turning to companies that are stronger financially.“During a market downturn, we would prefer companies that have high-quality, good cash flow and earnings certainty, because they have some buffer to offer dividends and share buybacks to support shares,” said William Fong, head of Hong Kong China equities at Barings.Tech Chart of the DayChip stocks fell for a second week in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s third straight 75-basis-point interest rate increase and amid mounting concerns of a global recession. The Philadelphia semiconductor index sank 6% this week and closed at the lowest level since 2020. The benchmark has now fallen 39% in 2022.Top Tech StoriesEricsson, still reeling from a cash-for-access probe in Iraq, has been plunged into a fresh governance scandal over applications to provide services and software in Russia.

UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%.The uptick in overall volumes as labor woes ease is an added positive. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. Management expects share repurchases in 2022 to be in line with the 2021 levels.However, escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in the operating expenses during first-half 2022. Fuel costs surged 82% in the period. Fuel costs are likely to be high in the September quarter as well. Results will be out on Oct 20. High capital expenditures may also be a downside.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AT&amp;T’s shares have declined -41.7% over the past year against Verizon's -27.8% decline and -16.8% pullback in the S&amp;P 500 index. The company is struggling with a steady decline in its legacy telephony Internet and wireline services. High-speed Internet revenues are also contracting due to a decline in the legacy digital subscriber line. With the divesture of WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T must build upon its core businesses to improve its value proposition as spectrum crisis and cord-cutting remain challenges.However, AT&amp;T is witnessing solid subscriber momentum. A customer-centric business model, is providing the company with healthy growth in its postpaid wireless business alongside a lower churn rate and higher-tier unlimited plans.The company is actively investing in key areas of 5G and fiber and adjusting its business according to the evolving market scenario to fuel long-term growth.

The company’s elevated operating expenses are expected to hurt the company's bottom line in the near term. Our estimates for total expenses (GAAP) suggest a CAGR of almost 17% over the next three years.Additionally, lower chance of sustainability of its capital deployment activities (given the volatile nature of its earnings) remains another major near-term concern and hence makes us apprehensive. However, Blackstone remains well-poised to benefit from its strong fund-raising ability, revenue mix and global footprint.The buyout of DCI is expected to further enhance its digital capabilities. Additionally, continued net inflows are expected to support Blackstone's assets under management (AUM) growth, going forward.

(NASDAQ:CSCO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$11b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 26% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Cisco Systems, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cisco Systems. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Cisco Systems does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cisco Systems' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Cisco Systems is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.5% of the company stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Cisco Systems, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$48m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Cisco Systems. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cisco Systems better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.
