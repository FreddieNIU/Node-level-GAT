A year ago, Schwab’s bank had $152 billion of assets paying depositors less than 25 basis points. As the Fed raised rates, Schwab’s customers could begin to earn more and more on their cash balances and migrated those assets over to Schwab’s money market funds. Over the last year, Schwab’s bank balances declined by 32% or $49 billion, but its money market assets increased by +143% or $216.8 billion.While it earns more on the banking side of the equation than it does in money market funds, the key for us is that Schwab retained and actually grew its wallet share and assets.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +1.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which The Charles Schwab Corporation falls in, has gained 5.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -21.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.27 points to a change of -16.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.18 indicates a change of +27.8% from what The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for The Charles Schwab Corporation.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.26 billion and $21.92 billion estimates indicate -7.2% and +13.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryThe Charles Schwab Corporation reported revenues of $5.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.15%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, The Charles Schwab Corporation surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.The Charles Schwab Corporation is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Charles Schwab Corporation. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.The upcoming announcement from the Federal Reserve on July 5 is expected to shed light on the perplexing discussions that occurred during their June meeting, leaving the financial industry in a state of confusion. Despite the fact that inflation did not decrease as rapidly as predicted, the Federal Open Market Committee made the surprising decision to pause its string of interest rate hikes, which had been implemented consistently over a period of 15 months. Adding to the intrigue, policymakers revealed their forecast of two additional rate increases for the remainder of the year, surpassing the initial expectations. This unforeseen turn of events has left investors scrambling for answers, eagerly awaiting the Federal Reserve's explanation and insight into their decision-making process. According to Bloomberg, The clarification from the Federal Reserve will be crucial in understanding the reasoning behind their divergence from the expected course of action and the potential implications for the financial markets. As market participants eagerly analyze the forthcoming details, they hope to gain a deeper understanding of the factors considered by the Federal Reserve and the potential impact on future economic conditions.Despite the growing risks, prominent bond managers, including Brandywine Global Investment Management, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, and Vanguard Group Inc., continue to hold a positive outlook on the US government debt market. They maintain their bullish stance, expecting a robust rally in fixed-income assets. However, this optimistic view faces challenges as the economy demonstrates resilience, potentially diminishing the appeal of bonds, and with the Federal Reserve contemplating raising interest rates. These factors introduce uncertainty and test the conviction of these bond managers in their bullish position, reported Bloomberg.Story continuesAccording to Reuters, labeling this year's equity market rally as solely driven by a few AI-powered stocks may misrepresent the situation and could actually be a source of strength. Despite the impressive 16% surge in the S&amp;P500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq's best first half in 40 years, concerns over a potential recession led investors to dismiss the rebound as narrow and unsustainable. Critics argue that an equal-weight version of the S&amp;P500 has only seen a modest 6% gain, while the remaining 490 stocks gained just 4%. The FANG+TM index, consisting of mega-cap tech stocks, soared by 75%. These stocks are among the largest globally, and their prominence in diversified portfolios makes them hard to overlook. Moreover, the estimated $7.1 trillion worth of indexed assets closely tracking the world's most prominent benchmark index may not be overly concerned about the specifics of how the 16% gain was achieved.The UK government and central bank find themselves heading towards a collision course as they grapple with the blame game surrounding the country's economic challenges. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May remained at a concerning 8.7%, unchanged from the previous month. Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco prices, reached its highest level in 31 years at 7.1%. The UK is facing a combination of economic woes, with stagnant economic growth and public debt surpassing 100% of GDP for the first time since March 1961. Shaan Raithatha, a senior economist at Vanguard, emphasized the severity of the situation, stating that the country is experiencing the ""worst of both worlds"" during an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" The clash between the government and central bank highlights the need for a unified approach to addressing rising inflation, sluggish growth, and mounting debt. Criticism is directed towards the government's policies, while pressure mounts on the central bank to implement measures to tackle inflationary pressures.On the stocks market front, analysts are bearish on biotech firm BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

On July 3, RBC lowered the price target for SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) to $276 from $290. Despite the adjustment, RBC maintains its Outperform rating for the company. The revised price target suggests a revised expectation for the stock's future valuation.Baron Real Estate Fund made the following comment about SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“In the most recent quarter, we exited our investment in SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC), a global wireless cell tower REIT that owns a portfolio of wireless tower sites heavily concentrated in the U.S. We had been long-term shareholders of SBA due to our respect for CEO Jeff Stoops, who we have known for several years. We believe Jeff has been an astute allocator of capital and has created tremendous shareholder value over the long term. Jeff will be retiring from SBA at the end of 2023.We believe a series of issues are likely to temper SBA’s growth in the next few years, including higher debt refinancing costs, wireless carrier decommissioning, headwinds from the company’s Latin American operations, and perhaps foreign exchange headwinds. Our sense is that the company’s annual cash flow growth will decelerate from 14% in 2022 to just 3% in 2023 and remain at modest annual growth rates over the next few years. The company’s high leverage, approximately 6.9 times net debt to cash flow, will limit the company’s ability for share repurchases and external growth opportunities.”06. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is one of the largest oil and gas equipment companies in the world. Like several others, it is also headquartered in Houston, Texas. The firm’s offshore and subsea segment provides umbilicals, subsea chemical injection, and fluid injection, among other products and services. Josh Silverstein, an analyst at UBS, has decided to maintain a Buy rating on Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) as of July 3. However, there has been a decrease in the price target, which has been adjusted from $49 to $46.Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. Investor concerns surrounding the impact that recent softness in crude oil and natural gas prices would have on the overall level of production activity weighed on the company’s stock in the quarter. However, the recent commitment by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce production to balance global supply and demand should support healthy levels of activity specifically within North American shale, where Halliburton is a market leader. Over the longer term, we believe the company also should lay a pivotal role in helping exploration and production companies navigate ongoing productivity declines.”Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10 Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance10 Special Situation Penny Stocks With Near Term CatalystsDisclosure.

8,14f03974-b7ce-3c05-a4d1-1a671dc769ab,UNM,2023-07-07,5 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week High That Can Climb Further,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-trading-near-52-123800904.html,1688647080,STORY,"['PLAY', 'UNM', 'VRT']","[Stocks hitting their 52-week high and delivering consistent performance in the past few quarters offer attractive opportunities to investors while building a portfolio. This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as UFP Industries UFPI, Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment PLAY, Unum Group UNM, Consolidated Water CWCO and Vertiv VRT are expected to maintain momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Story continuesSetting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High &gt;= .08This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.08 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks &gt; 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks &gt; 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales &lt;= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate &lt;= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) &gt;= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1 or 2No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price &gt;= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) &gt;= 100000The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are our five picks of the 27 stocks that made it through the screen:UFP Industries is a holding company with subsidiaries throughout North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The company supplies wood, wood composite and other products in retail, industrial and construction markets. The company has been benefiting from its investments in product and service enhancements and innovations to create value for customers. Also, accretive acquisition strategies and a strong liquidity position bode well. Its focus on building strength in UFP Packaging is an added positive. It expects to gain from the existing product portfolio, initiatives to better production efficiency and solid growth opportunities in the industrial market.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UFPI’s 2023 earnings has remained steady at $8.29 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 22.73%.Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment is a leading owner and operator of high-volume venues in North America that combines dining and entertainment for both adults and families. Dave &amp; Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in new and existing markets to drive growth. Management believes it can grow the concept to more than 200 units in the North and have significant appeal in certain international markets.In fiscal 2023, the company intends to open 16 new stores (including 11 Dave &amp; Buster's and 5 Main Event locations) and relocate Dave &amp; Buster's Vernon Hills store. The company recently inked a deal with the Malpani Group to open 15 new stores in India. Also, it partnered with the NightOwl Entertainment Group to open five stores in Australia.

Along with disability insurance, the company provides long-term care insurance, life insurance, and employer- and employee-paid group benefits and related services. Unum’s conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability.Sustained increase in premiums is fueled by high persistency levels in core business and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience.

The company has enough liquidity to address its short-term debt obligations.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1.

9,3f1f1ac9-f5ea-3ee1-aa9c-6be9561dd598,UNM,2023-07-07,"Zacks.com featured highlights include UFP Industries, Unum Group, EnerSys, DXP Enterprises and Group 1 Automotive",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-com-featured-highlights-ufp-114600855.html,1688643960,STORY,"['UNM', 'GPI', 'ENS', 'DXPE']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 6, 2023 – Stocks in this week’s article are UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI, Unum Group UNM, EnerSys ENS, DXP Enterprises, Inc. DXPE and Group 1 Automotive, Inc. GPI.5 Value Stocks with Exciting EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Own NowInvestors typically have a fixation on the price-to-earnings (P/E) strategy while seeking stocks trading at attractive prices. This straight forward, easy-to-calculate ratio is the most preferred among all the valuation metrics in the investment toolkit for working out the fair market value of a stock. But even this ubiquitously used valuation metric is not without its pitfalls.While P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company's valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation. UFP Industries, Inc., Unum Group, EnerSys, DXP Enterprises, Inc. and Group 1 Automotive, Inc. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.EV-to-EBITDA is a Better Substitute, Here's WhyEV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company's profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Usually, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company's balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesAnother shortcoming of P/E is that it can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A company's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value loss-making companies that are EBITDA positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements.Therefore, a strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:UFP Industries supplies wood, wood composite and other products in retail, industrial and construction markets. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Value Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UFP Industries' current-year earnings has been revised 4.4% upward over the past 60 days.

10,89035d86-a8b7-3956-b1b2-aa914ab96deb,TMO,2023-07-07,Will Thermo Fisher (TMO) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-tmo-beat-estimates-161012518.html,1688659812,STORY,['TMO'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry.This maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2.83%.For the most recent quarter, Thermo Fisher was expected to post earnings of $4.95 per share, but it reported $5.03 per share instead, representing a surprise of 1.62%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.19 per share, while it actually produced $5.40 per share, a surprise of 4.05%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Thermo Fisher lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thermo Fisher currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.18%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 26, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

11,d79c2546-f473-3a44-9a81-077e6938540c,TMO,2023-07-07,12 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-robotics-stocks-buy-154518106.html,1688658318,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TSLA', 'PATH', 'TMO', 'ZBRA', 'AME', 'ROK', 'KITT', 'HLX', 'TER', 'AMBA']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best robotics stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our analysis of the robotics industry, how it is gradually affecting several walks of life, and want to skip ahead to the top five stocks on this list, then take a look at 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now. One trend that is slowly taking over the industrial world and making slow inroads into consumer use as well, is the growing use of robotics. Their utility, particularly in heavy duty industrial manufacturing and tasks that are often hazardous to humans has created new opportunities for growth and cost efficiencies.In fact, as the world was reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the use of robotics in industries actually grew. Data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) shows that when it came to the food and beverages industry, the use of robotics grew by 25% in 2021 to sit at 3,402 units as they provided a handy way of continuing business and adhering to social distancing requirements at the same time. And while the use of robots in the food industry was in the thousands, as a whole, more than half a million robots are deployed across various industries such as chemicals, automobile manufacturing, and plastic production. These sectors often carry hazards to human health, as they require handling dangerous materials, heavy equipment, or conducting repetitive tasks.The growth in the use of robotics is part of a growing trend toward automation that provides firms with an opportunity to streamline their operations and reduce worker costs. According to McKinsey, automation can boost global productivity by as much as 1.4% each year and it could even cut paid positions in half. The nature of its products, which are heavy machines that require significant manual labor otherwise, has also led to the automotive industry being one of the biggest users of robotics by accounting for 29% of global automation demand as of 2022.Story continuesBuilding on this, the global robotics industry was worth $27 billion in 2020 and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.45% to be worth $74 billion by 2027. As should be expected, automotive production and industrialization will play a key role in this market. Some of the top industrial robotics companies in the world are Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), ABB Ltd (OTCMKTS:ABBNY), and DENSO Corporation (OTCMKTS:DNZOY), and for more details on this highly lucrative robotics niche, you can check out Top 10 Industrial Robotics Companies in the World.Taking a deeper look at what some of these firms are doing, ABB Ltd (OTCMKTS:ABBNY), one of the most proactive robotics firms in the world, is right at the top of its game as it has already started to consider how to bring artificial intelligence to industrial robotics. The firm has partnered up with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to integrate AI into industrial processes for reducing machine downtime and increasing equipment lifespans. It will also allow decision makers to consolidate operational data with their decision making processes to provide better insights.Another highly consequential robotics firm, particularly when it comes to healthcare use is Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). Its robots, as the name suggests, aid surgeons conduct some of the most difficult tasks in the world. And on this front, Intuitive scored a big win earlier this year when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its da Vinci surgical system for use in simple prostate surgery where doctors remove portions of an enlarged prostate to ensure smooth urinal flow. The system was also approved for a prostate surgery procedure where the entire gland is removed, often for patients that have prostate cancer. And while these are established companies with a large operations base, newer and younger companies are also entering the industry.One such firm is Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (NASDAQ:KITT) which went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021 in a $150 million initial public offering. The IPO was one of many during a time when SPACs were quite popular with retail investors, who flocked to them in droves due to the potential for share price appreciation. Nauticus is an interesting robotics firm, with a business model that is called robotics as a service (RaaS). This allows firms to use robots on a subscription basis, enabling them to save up on capital expenditures and utilize cost savings and efficiencies at the same time. However, the very expectation of a high return through an IPO also led to the shares of Nauticus' SPAC firm Cleantech tanking by 35% when shareholders approved the IPO since it also disclosed that roughly 1.4 million shares would be available for trading while retail investors had believed the float would be lower.As to what's happening in the robotics industry right now, here's what the management of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) had to say during the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings conference:One of our large multiyear wins in eCommerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell’s smart machine architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale. Another important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic’s disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications. Moving to our Hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top robotics stocks, out of which the notable names are Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG).12 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the best robotics stocks, we first made a list of all robotics companies operating in industrial, healthcare, software (yes there are software robots, as part of robotic process automation systems), and other domains.

If you want to skip our analysis of the natural resources industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Buy. Despite the fact that technology is king these days, humankind is reaching for the stars, and an infinite amount of information is available in the palm of the hand, the simple fact is that natural resources are the dominant factor that has contributed to progress.The world's cars run on fossil fuels, computers, and gadgets rely on copper, minerals, and other natural resources, and construction relies on lumber to build a large number of buildings. And even though renewable energy is all the buzz these days, petroleum products are still the go to choice for generating electricity and running airplanes and cars. The world's infrastructure is dependent on natural resources, and at least for the near term future, they are here to stay.This need for natural resources became even clearer in 2022 in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are two integral suppliers of gas, commodities, and other agricultural products. A conflict between the two shook up global supply chains for these valuable products. These effects were felt especially in Europe which had come to rely on cheap Russian gas to keep inflation down and fuel economic growth. The sum of the invasion's effects on the stock market involved primarily the shares of energy companies soaring at a time when their technology peers tanked. This share price growth also reaped dividends in literal form for investors, with Bloomberg reporting that during the three weeks that ended in September 2022 alone, energy companies paid out a massive $16.4 billion in dividends to mark a 15% sequential growth over the second quarter.Yet, natural resources also confer countries a predetermined advantage, unlike say innovation, which can surface in any country if the right conditions are in place. This also leaves some countries better off than others, and this dominance remains stable over the course of the years unless dramatic new discoveries are made. Our research of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources confirms this fact, as some of the largest countries in the world are also the richest. The top three countries are Russia, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia, with each having copious amounts of minerals, gas, and oil.Story continuesBuilding on this, the natural resources industry is also quite lucrative. One important natural resource industry is the mining sector. Research shows that this sector was worth $1.84 trillion in 2021 and was slated to grow to $2 trillion in 2022 to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. As opposed to some industries where the growth rate slows down over the passage of time, the case is the opposite in the mining industry which is slated to exhibit a CAGR of 12.9% to be worth $3.36 trillion by 2026. Naturally, this makes mining companies quite lucrative, with BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Glencore being the top three most valuable mining companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Moving towards one of the most important industries in the world, namely the energy industry, shows that this sector is worth trillions of dollars. For instance, the crude oil market alone was worth $2.7 trillion last year and is slated to grow to $2.9 trillion by the end of this year. From then on until 2027, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to be worth $3.7 trillion by then. For more details on the energy industry, be sure to check out Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World.Some top energy companies that we have identified are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). Combining these with the top mining companies named above lets us see what's going on in the industry right now. For instance, Shell announced in March that in addition to fueling gasoline vehicles, it will now also power electric cars after having completed the acquisition of Volta Inc in the U.S. This provides Shell access to a network of 3,000 charging points all over America, in more than 30 states as well as providing it the potential to expand this network by adding another 3,400 charging points. Taking a look at mining, BHP took the lead on the artificial intelligence front, when it announced in May that it has teamed up with Microsoft to use artificial intelligence and machine learning at the world's largest copper mine in Chile. Through this, the mining giant aims to improve production, contractor performance, and copper recovery from the site.As to what's on the minds of the companies themselves, here's what the management of Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:Following these principles, we’ve successfully won and advanced many clean energy projects, of which I’d like to highlight just a few. The left side represents projects currently under construction. These are projects with executed contracts, fixed payments and incremental growth with predictable returns. With project CapEx of just under $2 billion, including the new OCI project in Texas, where Linde will supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen by capturing CO2 for underground sequestration through our partner, ExxonMobil. Currently, this project makes up the majority of clean energy projects in our backlog since most electrolyzer investments are designated for the merchant market and therefore, considered base CapEx. There are a few projects like the recently announced Evonik agreement that meet backlog criteria.But even here, we support local network and supply high-purity clean hydrogen to electronics and other industrial customers as well. Currently, we view these electrolysis — electrolyzer projects as modules in our local supply network for supply of merchant hydrogen. They’re often integrated into our existing hydrogen network, sometimes side by side leveraging the same storage and transportation infrastructure, helping optimize distribution costs. Furthermore, these projects leverage various electrolyzer technologies, including PEM and outline to provide the best fit to customer needs. Sale of Plug is another avenue for Linde to participate in growth opportunities, which may have different customer demands or which may not benefit from integration with our existing supply network.With these details in mind let's take a look at some great natural resources stocks, out of which the notable names are Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).12 Best Natural Resources Stocks to BuyOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best natural resources stocks to buy based on hedge fund sentiment, we first narrowed down the top mining, forestry, and oil companies by market capitalization.

16,89a657f6-c46b-3f64-a827-4afa53c832ae,CTAS,2023-07-07,Cintas (CTAS) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-ctas-earnings-expected-grow-140007092.html,1688652007,STORY,['CTAS'],"[The market expects Cintas (CTAS) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 13, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis uniform rental company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.25 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.04% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cintas?For Cintas, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cintas will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cintas would post earnings of $3.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.14, delivering a surprise of +4.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cintas doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We will also discuss the emerging trends around Edtech, the key players in the industry, and the worrying numbers of missing teachers around the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Countries with the Best Education. Quality education is crucial for countries as it lays the foundation for individual and societal development. A strong education system promotes social mobility, reduces inequalities, and fosters a culture of lifelong learning. Ultimately, investing in the best education ensures a nation's competitiveness, sustainable growth, and a brighter future for its people. Hence, as nations strive to provide quality education to their citizens, some countries have emerged as global leaders in promoting an environment that nurtures learning, innovation, and critical thinking.According to OECD Education Rankings, Estonia, leads among all OECD countries with an average PISA score of 526, closely followed by Japan and Korea with scores of 520. On the other end of the spectrum is Colombia, the lowest-performing OECD country, with an average score of 406. This highlights a pertinent gap of 120 points between the highest and lowest-performing countries within the OECD.Which Countries Have The Toughest Education Systems?It is true when they say mental toughness fosters critical thinking. When challenges are faced head-on, students develop resilience, perseverance, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. This connection is particularly evident in countries like South Korea, Japan, and Singapore, known for their toughest education systems. They not only prioritize academic excellence but also set rigorous standards for their students.Where is EdTech headed?The Covid-19 pandemic fueled the rise of digital education around the world which is now heading towards a future characterized by increased accessibility, personalized learning experiences, and the integration of emerging educational technologies. Such a future is promised by the trends observed around Edtech and Edtech Companies.Story continuesFirstly, venture capitalists have invested over $20.8 billion in the Edtech sector globally in 2021. Companies are continuously upskilling their workforce, and online education is becoming the new norm. The Global EdTech venture capital investments in 2022 reached $10.6 billion, experiencing a 49% decline compared to the record levels of 2021. However, 2023 is expected to see a moderation back to pre-pandemic levels with growth in the US, Europe, and India, replacing China's dominance in EdTech funding.Moreover, EdTech firms are merging and partnering to achieve economies of scale and address high customer acquisition costs. For instance, in 2022, 2U Inc. (NYSE:TWOU) introduced a major feature to its degree partnership model, expanding its support for a broader range of programs and institutions on the edX platform. This updated model allows universities to tailor partnership packages to align with their specific needs, offering different levels of technology-enabled services. Importantly, in all degree programs powered by 2U Inc (NYSE:TWOU) and edX, university partners maintain control over essential academic functions, such as tuition and admission decisions.Secondly, large firms are investing in employee reskilling and upskilling to attract and retain talent. Edtech companies are expanding their enterprise offerings to meet the demand for upskilling and reskilling. This was exemplified by the retail giant, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It is expanding its learning and development contributions by partnering with edtech company Springboard to offer short-form programs through Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)’s Live Better U program.These programs aim to upskill associates in high-demand areas such as cybersecurity, software engineering, and data analytics. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s investment in education includes covering the total cost of college fees and associated expenses for its associates, resulting in approximately $333 million in tuition savings since 2018. The program has shown positive results, with enrollees being more likely to receive promotions and stay with the company.Lastly, Edtech providers are focusing on enhancing user experiences by offering value-added services like personalized mentoring, job preparation, and community support. In line with this trend, Strategic Education Inc (NASDAQ:STRA)'s US Higher Education segment has witnessed growth for the first time since 2020. The segment experienced year-over-year growth of 2.3% in Q1 2023, driven by increased enrollments in the Capella and Strayer University programs. The growth can be attributed to both individual enrollments and registrations through employer affiliations.As part of its services, Strategic Education Inc (NASDAQ:STRA) provides a subscription-based service called Sophia Learning that grants students access to a wide range of college-level courses for a monthly fee of $99. Additionally, through a recent partnership with the University of the People, the company has gained access to a potential student base of 126,000. The credits earned through this program are transferable to partner colleges and universities. The success of the program is evident from a noteworthy 24% year-over-year increase in total subscribers and an impressive 36% growth in revenue of Strategic Education Inc (NASDAQ:STRA) during Q1 2023.Losing Teachers: A Growing ConcernEven though EdTech and digital education are on the rise, traditional teaching and learning have not been eliminated from educational institutions. However, while teaching is one of the most respected professions in the world, its absence haunts educational institutions worldwide. Teacher shortages are becoming a significant concern across several European countries, including France, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, and Italy. These countries are grappling with recruitment challenges and a general sense of disillusionment within the teaching profession, exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Germany, despite having one of the best education systems, estimates a shortage of 25,000 teachers by 2025, while Portugal expects a shortfall of 30,000 by 2030. France currently has 4,000 vacant teaching positions. The lack of attractiveness in the profession can be attributed to factors such as low wages, deteriorating working conditions, and a perceived lack of status. Similar teacher shortages are not limited to Europe; the United States and countries in sub-Saharan Africa are also faced with difficulties in finding and retaining teachers.20 Countries with the Best Educationgpointstudio/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo rank countries with the best education, we utilized a methodology based on three key indicators: expenditure, presence of quality institutions, and strength of the educational system. Firstly, we examined the percentage of GDP allocated towards education expenditure. We sourced data for GDP allocation towards education from the IMF. Secondly, we considered the number of flagship and highly ranked institutions, with a particular focus on universities emphasizing research. Lastly, we assessed the overall consensus of citizens regarding the quality of education provided. Each indicator was assigned a score out of 10, and these scores were then averaged to calculate an overall score out of 10 for each country.Here is the list of countries with the best education:20.

With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Huntington Bancshares, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Huntington Bancshares?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Huntington Bancshares does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Huntington Bancshares' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Huntington Bancshares. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 9.5% and 5.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Huntington BancsharesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$118m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Huntington Bancshares  you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Is it too late to be shopping for Nasdaq bargains?The good news is that while the Nasdaq is up to a huge degree, there are still pockets of value out there. Beyond the hottest AI stocks and other trendy trades, there are still some high-quality, undervalued Nasdaq stocks… including these three top picks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCisco (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the world’s dominant provider of internet networking equipment. The company has long been famous for its routers, switches, and other such essentials for managing digital connectivity.CSCO shares have generally traded at a low valuation as investors perceive this to be a commodity business with only modest growth prospects. That’s true to an extent: Software certainly has more attractive upside than hardware vendors in most cases.That said, Cisco has been undergoing a major strategic shift. In recent years, it has layered a lot more software and security offerings on top of its core business In fact, subscription revenues now make up more than 40% of Cisco’s total overall base and are growing at a double-digit rate.Over the past year, we’ve seen shares of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and other legacy tech companies explode higher as investors wake up to their newer growth verticals. At less than 14x forward earnings, Cisco shares should be poised for a similar rerating.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN)The front of a Huntington (HBAN) office. Source: SNEHIT PHOTO / Shutterstock.comThe banking sector had a rough start to the year. The rapid rise in interest rates along with instability in sectors such as venture capital led to several large bank failures. Investors sold the sector off mercilessly as a result.However, things have calmed down. Deposit levels have stabilized. Recent stress tests showed all 23 of the nation’s largest banks are in better shape now than last year. And loan performance and credit quality remain strong despite the worries around commercial real estate.Story continuesAll this to say that investors should give strong regional banks like Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) another look. HBAN stock is down 25% year to date, despite upbeat earnings results. Shares now go for less than eight times forward earnings. The company pays a generous 5.9% dividend yield.Morningstar’s Eric Compton is optimistic on HBAN stock, seeing fair value at $15 per share versus today’s price of less than $11. He believes the bank’s stable deposit base and unique auto financing business are among its strong points.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo overlays daylight photo of corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), by some accounts, may just be the most undervalued large-cap Nasdaq stock out there today. Morningstar analyst Brett Horn sees fair value way up at $135 per share, implying PYPL stock is roughly 50% undervalued today.It’s worth adding that PayPal traded around $110 per share prior to the onset of the pandemic, and at one point hit $300 during the ensuing tech stock boom. Was $300 a fair price for PayPal? Not at all. But today’s sub-$70 level may be a severe overcorrection.PayPal is now selling for less than 14 times forward earnings, and analysts continue to see that figure growing at a double-digit rate.It’s true that PayPal isn’t going to see the same sort of explosive growth that it did in 2021. The confluence of factors that led to that period’s e-commerce and payments growth was unique.But the core PayPal business is still operating normally and is increasing in size. And other irons in the fire such as Venmo offer intriguing upside as well. PayPal’s dismal stock performance over the past 18 months has caused many people to give up on it, but a closer look at the business results indicate that there is still a lot to like here.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HBAN stock.

32,f2e6c816-1ff6-3a52-b356-bc6dd09f1585,MET,2023-07-07,MET or AIG: Which Multiline Insurance Stock is Better-Positioned?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/met-aig-multiline-insurance-stock-150800349.html,1688656080,STORY,"['MET', 'AIG']","[The U.S. multiline insurers are riding on the back of diversified portfolios, improved pricing environment, interest rate hikes, prudent underwriting results and technological advancements.Premiums, the most significant contributor to an insurer’s top line, is aided by uninterrupted rate hikes, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates. Diversified portfolios of multiline insurers minimize concentration risks and hence, provides an impetus to their premiums. For constructing such efficient portfolios, industry players often resort to mergers and acquisitions and a solid capital position backs them to undertake such growth-related initiatives.Industry participants with exposure to property and casualty (“P&amp;C”) business line might reap the benefit of rate increases in property and personal lines. Significant rate hikes will outstrip the claim costs and hence, drive the underwriting results of multiline insurers. Per Swiss Re, the U.S. P&amp;C insurance premiums are expected to improve 7.5% in 2023 followed by a 5.5% rise in 2024.Though catastrophe losses come with its own share of worries, they usually ramp up the policy renewal rate, thereby leading to a better pricing environment.Improved interest rates boost investment yields for those insurers that have exposure to rate-sensitive products. After three rate hikes so far in 2023, the Fed finally put a temporary halt to its rate-hiking spree in the June meeting. Nevertheless, it signaled two probable rate hikes this year. An aging U.S. population and a high mortality rate observed nationwide are likely to have sustained the solid demand for insurance and protection products of life insurers in the days ahead.Auto premiums are aided by an increasing number of cars plying on roads — owing to people's confidence in traveling — and the easing of inflationary headwinds. Resumption of commercial and industrial activities in full swing are expected to keep the demand for workers compensation insurance high in the days ahead.Story continuesPrudent technology investments in blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation boosts margins of multiline insurers by bringing about accelerated claim payments and automation in processes.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector gained 5.3% in the past three months compared with the sector’s growth of 6.1%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P Index has risen 8.8% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAgainst this backdrop, let’s take a look at two multiline insurance stocks, MetLife, Inc. MET and American International Group, Inc. AIG, with market capitalizations of $43.1 billion and $41.5 billion, respectively. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's delve into specific parameters to ascertain which company is better positioned at the moment.Price PerformanceAmerican International’s shares have gained 13% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 5.3%. Shares of MetLife have declined 3.8% in the same time frame. Evidently, AIG has the edge over MET here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise track helps investors get an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.MET’s bottom line beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average surprise being 0.70%. AIG’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 9.22%. Thus, American International has a better reading than MetLife on this front.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a profitability measure, which indicates how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders' funds.MetLife's ROE of 16.9% compares favorably with American International’s ROE of 8.6% and remains higher than the industry’s average of 9.8%.ValuationPrice-to-book (P/B) value is the best multiple used for valuing insurance stocks. Compared with MET’s forward 12-month P/B ratio of 1.34, AIG is cheaper, with a reading of 0.91. The multiline insurance industry’s P/B ratio is 2.28.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe lower the debt-to-equity ratio, the better for the company as it implies a sound solvency level. American International’s leverage ratio of 56.2% remains lower than MetLife’s ratio of 57.5% and the industry’s average of 60.5%. Therefore, AIG holds an edge over MET in this case.Dividend YieldBoth companies are regular dividend payers. MetLife’s dividend yield of 3.7% betters American International’s metric of 2.5% and is higher than the industry’s average of 2.7%. MET wins over AIG on this front.Robust 2023 ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MetLife’s 2023 earnings indicates a year-over-year improvement of 12.9%, while the same for American International suggests a 42.9% year-over-year growth this year. Thus, AIG has the edge over MET here.Long-Term Growth ProjectionBoth stocks' expected long-term earnings growth rate is lower than the industry’s average of 12.1%. However, the metric for MetLife is pegged at 11.2%, better than American International’s figure of 10%.VGM ScoreThe VGM Score rates each stock on its combined weighted styles, helping identify those with the most attractive value, the best growth and the most promising momentum. MetLife and American International have an unimpressive VGM Score of C, faring equally on this front.Insurance PremiumsOne of the major contributors to an insurer’s revenues is its premiums. The metric for MetLife declined 9.7% year over year in the first quarter of 2023, while the same for American International improved 19.1% year over year in the same time frame. Thus. AIG is the winner in this context.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that American International is better poised than MetLife for its price performance, earnings surprise, valuation, debt-to-equity ratio, 2023 prospects and insurance premiums. MET scores higher in terms of ROE, expected long-term growth forecast and dividend yield. With the scale tipping majorly toward AIG, the stock appears to be better poised.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's more than twice the amount of oil that was sold during the same period last year, and it's the highest volume of oil Iran has exported since the US reimposed strict sanctions on the country in 2018.Much of that oil has been making its way to China, which is now Iran's top oil customer. China bought 359,000 barrels of crude a day from Iran in May, Kpler data shows. Syria and Venezuela have also emerged as key buyers of Iranian oil.The surge comes as Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other OPEC+ producers take major steps to dial back oil production, with Saudi Arabia extending its 1 million barrel-a-day production cut through August, and Russia recently vowing to slash its oil production by another half million barrels a day.Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of OPEC+, has long complained about market ""distortions"" that are keeping oil prices low, leading it to slash production aggressively over the last year to boost crude prices. Though Iran is part of OPEC+, it currently doesn't have an output quota within the cartel due to being under US sanctions.Iranian suppliers have also offered steep discounts on crude relative to Saudi Arabia and even Russia, which has discounted its oil heavily since beginning its invasion of Ukraine.Iranian oil is sold around a $30 discount per barrel compared to competitors in the Persian Gulf, officials told the Journal. Still, the nation pulled in $28 billion in crude exports in the last Persian calendar year ending March 2023, about four times what it made in 2021.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Both benchmarks ended up about 5% for the week.""We're knocking on the door of a major breakout to the upside. I think you're seeing some short covering here today ... because a lot of people have been betting on the short side, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group.After two months of price consolidation between roughly $73-77, Brent moved into technically overbought territory for the first time since mid April.""The rally over the last week or so ... has been quite strong and backed by momentum - as well as fresh cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia,"" said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA.Top oil exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia announced fresh output cuts this week bringing total reductions by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, to around 5 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 5% of global oil demand.""OPEC+ production cuts are expected to tighten the market, driving supply deficits in the second half of 2023, supporting higher oil prices,"" analysts at U.S. financial services company Morningstar said in a note.OPEC will likely maintain an upbeat view on oil demand growth for next year, sources close to OPEC said.Russia's latest pledge to reduce oil exports will not require a similar cut in production, a government source told Reuters.Oil analytics firm Vortexa said there are currently 10.5 million barrels of Saudi crude in floating storage off the Egyptian Red Sea port of Ain Sukhna, down by almost half from mid-June.Story continuesIn the U.S., energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for the first time in 10 weeks, due to the biggest weekly increase in gas rigs since October 2016, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes Co.In Norway, Equinor ASA paused production at its Oseberg East oil field in the North Sea due to staffing shortages.In Mexico, six people were injured after a fire broke out on Friday morning at an offshore platform run by state oil company Pemex in the Gulf of Mexico.Also supporting crude prices, the U.S. dollar fell to a two-week low after data showed U.S. job growth was lower than expected but still strong enough to likely lead the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to resume raising interest rates later this month as it has signaled.A weaker dollar makes crude cheaper for holders of other currencies, which could boost oil demand.According to the CME Group Inc's FedWatch Tool, the probability that the Fed increases interest rates by 25 basis points at its July 25-26 meeting is now around 95%, up from 92% just prior to the data coming out.Higher borrowing costs could slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.In Europe, decades-high inflation and the impact of war in Ukraine has forced companies to impose hiring freezes and lay-offs.In Germany, a swift economic recovery appeared less likely as data showed a surprise fall in industrial production.(Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in London and Sudarshan Varadhan in Singapore; editing by David Gregorio and Marguerita Choy)]"
39,8ac44a80-b033-3a14-95ce-ee062a60dcf8,O,2023-07-07,Oil Bulls Predict Surge In Prices As Interest Rates Inch Higher,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-bulls-predict-surge-prices-230000898.html,1688684400,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Fears of recessions and weaker-than-expected oil demand have dominated oil market sentiment for most of the first half of this year.Yet, demand has even exceeded expectations in the spring, while the OPEC+ alliance is stepping in again to cut supply to the market. Oil prices have ignored the fundamentals so far as traders and speculators have remained focused on what sharply rising interest rates would do to economies.Few have thought, however, what soaring interest rates – and consequently, funding costs – would do to the physical and paper market for oil apart from baking in recession fears.Unprecedented Physical Destocking The aggressive monetary tightening and the 500 basis points hike in Fed’s key interest rates in just one year – from a near-zero interest rate policy for over a decade since the financial crisis – is changing the structure of the oil market, analysts say.The actual influence of soaring funding costs on the oil market is that traders are destocking and selling off physical barrels because the costs to hold crude, and the penalty for keep holding that crude if demand tumbles in a deep recession, have spiked.“For oil refineries and trading companies, the cost of holding oil in tanks has become much more expensive,” Amrita Sen, director of research and co-founder at Energy Aspects, wrote in a post in the Financial Times this week.History has shown that as interest rates rise, inventory drawdowns are accelerating in a backwardated market, where prices are higher for immediate delivery due to strong demand, Sen notes.In the past, crude inventories in developed economies would fall by 10 million barrels on average year over year for each 1 percentage point hike in interest rates, the expert added.And since March 2022, interest rates have risen by 5 percentage points.This has led to what Goldman Sachs analysts dubbed in May “the great de-stocking,” which leaves the market much more vulnerable to shocks and to the OPEC+ moves to prop up oil prices.Story continuesGlobally, commercial oil inventories are expected to sink by the end of the year to some of the lowest levels in the past decade, Energy Aspects’ Sen says.“All this will leave the market vulnerable to shocks and unexpected Opec+ policy moves by the end of the year. Buckle up!,” she wrote.Goldman Sachs, which has been bullish on oil all year despite the market correction that led to a $10 a barrel decline in prices so far in 2023, also sees a large and unprecedented physical and paper de-stocking in crude.“Such unprecedented de-stocking should not be surprising. Markets have rarely seen such a sharp rise in funding costs from such a low level,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note at the end of May.“Financially, paper commodities experienced a similar de-stock given the cost of holding positions against higher funding costs and more volatility,” Goldman analysts, including Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research, said.“Barring a global recession, rock (fundamentals) should beat paper (positioning) during 2H23, creating an unwind of the significant build-up in shorts.”The sharp increase in funding costs and the high inflation have accelerated the pace of destocking in oil, Currie told CNBC at the end of May.“Destocking just cannot keep on going,” he said, adding that Goldman sees the fair value of crude oil at $97 a barrel at the end of this year.Oil is currently a liability, and destocking could tighten the market so much that prices will pop up and make holding oil an asset again, Currie noted.Demand Is Not To Blame For Falling Oil Prices While many headlines have blamed fears of weak demand and recessions for the decline in oil prices in the first half of this year, evidence and estimates from forecasters suggest that demand has outperformed expectations.Energy Aspects, for example, says that “oil demand has been anything but weak.” Data has shown that global oil demand has jumped by 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) year on year, exceeding Energy Aspects’ forecast by 300,000 bpd.According to Goldman Sachs, oil demand has surprised to the upside.“Despite all the concerns over a recession that many market participants view as almost certain during 2H23, it is important to emphasize that the evidence in commodities supports stronger not weaker demand,” Goldman’s analysts say.“Beginning with oil, the IEA and other forecasters, including ourselves, have actually steadily increased oil demand growth forecasts this year.”In its Oil Market Report for June, the IEA said that “Global oil demand continues to defy the challenging macroeconomic climate and is set to rise by 2.4 mb/d in 2023, outpacing last year’s 2.3 mb/d increase as well as earlier expectations.”“China’s rebound continues unabated,” and its apparent demand in April jumped to an all-time high of 16.3 million bpd. India’s demand is also strong, reaching record consumption of gasoline and diesel in May, the IEA says.Goldman Sachs analysts believe “that it is mostly supply, rather than demand, that is to blame for softer-than-expected balances.”Once the great de-stocking is over, depleting inventories to multi-year lows, oil prices will be more vulnerable to shocks and volatility and could pop up higher.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Saudi Arabia's Solo Act Won’t Save The Oil BullsBig Oil Revives Offshore ExplorationSaudi Arabia Hikes Oil Prices To AsiaRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith breaks down the numbers.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Some upbeat news for Microsoft this morning after Morgan Stanley bumped its price target on the tech giant, naming it one of the top picks for generative AI. Yahoo Finance's 3 5 anchor Seana Smith joins us now with the details.SEANA SMITH: Hi, Diane and Brad. All right. So some good news here for Microsoft, a top pick like you just said at Morgan Stanley. The team there led by Keith Weiss laying out a few reasons as to why they're seeing such a massive opportunity when it comes to Microsoft and its potential with AI.Now, we know that Microsoft has really been in the conversation as one of the leaders. Many times these leaders when it comes to capitalizing on that AI frenzy that we have seen since the start of the year.So when it comes to AI, what that's going to do here for businesses as generative AI continues to really expand the workflow process that will be automated. Morgan Stanley making the case here that Microsoft is best positioned in this. And they lay out this chart right here just in terms of the products that are incorporating generative AI and really showing Microsoft's advantage in this.They asked a group of people in their survey about how they plan to use or whether or not they plan to use some of these Microsoft products that do incorporate generative AI over the next 12 months. And you can see almost a third saying that they plan to use Azure OpenAI services. About a fifth here, 22% saying that they plan to use a Microsoft 365 Copilot here. So that really laying out the bull case for Microsoft's growth and their position right now when it comes to the AI frenzy.So when you take into account some of the performance that we have seen in Microsoft stock since the start of the year, it's already up 41%. You can see it started in the year right around 245 bucks a share, a massive run up to where it is today, right around $339. With the new price target out from Morgan Stanley is 415 bucks.Story continuesLet's put that all in perspective for you right now. Morgan Stanley saying that Microsoft, they still see room to run of over 20%. So what's it going to take to get there? Obviously, wider adoption of generative AI. We know Microsoft had a massive $10 billion investment in OpenAI. That, of course, giving them the edge.But Morgan Stanley also bringing up the PEG ratio. So that's price to earnings divided by expected earnings growth, that right here they're talking about valuation despite that massive runoff that we've seen since the start of the year.They're saying that historically and historical standards when it comes to that PEG ratio, it's actually in line with what we have seen in the past. So some of that fear that maybe Microsoft is overvalued. they're saying that some of that fear is a little overdone at this point.So again, the massive run up, 41% since the start of the year. Microsoft clearly one of the outperformers in the broader market, really riding the tech wave, the excitement around AI since the start of the year. Morgan Stanley, though, guys, making the case that the stock has a lot more room to run.BRAD SMITH: All right.DIANE KING HALL: Clearly.BRAD SMITH: Top notch reporting there from our own Seana Smith and as well as the penmanship on the YFi.SEANA SMITH: I was trying. I was trying my best.BRAD SMITH: That is not easy.[INTERPOSING VOICES]SEANA SMITH: I think it came across.BRAD SMITH: Well done. Well done.]"

DUK recently announced its decision to divest its commercial distributed generation (DG) business to an affiliate of private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners in a $364 million deal. The transaction is expected to reach completion by the end of 2023 and will generate about $259 million of proceeds for DUK.The business includes distributed fuel cell projects managed by Bloom Energy, REC Solar’s operating assets, development pipeline and O&amp;M portfolio.Rationale Behind the SaleThe latest sale agreement preceded Duke Energy’s commitment to selling its utility-scale renewables business platform, announced last month. The company expects to receive proceeds from both these divestments by the end of 2023, which are aimed at bolstering DUK’s balance sheet. It also plans to use gains from these sale-outs to avoid holding any additional debt associated with these two assets.Further, the company aims to utilize these sale proceeds to upgrade its grid reliability and integrate more than 30,000 megawatts of regulated renewable energy into its system by 2035.As part of its clean energy portfolio expansion strategy, Duke Energy currently operates 1,200 MW of solar in Florida, with plans to continue adding approximately 300 MW a year going forward. We expect the proceeds from the aforementioned divestments to play a vital role in enabling DUK to duly achieve the clean energy target.Peer MovesElectric utilities in the United States are rapidly shifting their focus away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources to meet climate goals. Like Duke Energy, other utilities that have recently made divestments to fund their clean energy promotion are FirstEnergy Corp. FE, Consolidated Edison Inc. ED and NiSource Inc NI.FirstEnergy signed a sale agreement in February 2023 to divest an additional 30% of its ownership interest in FirstEnergy Transmission business to Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion. FE plans to use the sale proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt and fund its clean energy transition.FE’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 6.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 5.8% over 2022’s reported figure.Consolidated Edison completed the sale of its clean energy business to RWE Renewables America, LLC, in March 2023, for $6.8 billion. The sale proceeds from this divestment should aid ED in making significant investments in clean energy transmission projects, building electrification, energy efficiency, electric vehicle infrastructure and battery storage.ED’s long-term earnings growth rate is 2%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 9.51%.  In June 2023, NiSource signed an agreement to sell 19.9% of its equity stake in NIPSCO, Indiana's largest vertically integrated electric and gas distribution company, to Blockstone Inc.’s infrastructure group for $2.15 billion.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Salesforce.com (CRM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.79, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.79 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.5% and 5.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is CRM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $7.44.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.

48,7b9b7c40-1a42-34e6-a146-0661b86fe2a1,SEE,2023-07-07,An Intrinsic Calculation For Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) Suggests It's 46% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-sealed-air-corporation-104933655.html,1688726973,STORY,['SEE'],"[Key InsightsSealed Air's estimated fair value is US$75.19 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquitySealed Air's US$40.28 share price signals that it might be 46% undervalued Analyst price target for SEE is US$53.15 which is 29% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Sealed Air Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$606.8mUS$676.3mUS$703.5mUS$712.0mUS$722.0mUS$733.7mUS$746.7mUS$760.6mUS$775.4mUS$790.8mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 1.41%Est @ 1.62%Est @ 1.77%Est @ 1.87%Est @ 1.94%Est @ 1.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$561US$578US$556US$520US$488US$459US$432US$406US$383US$361(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.7bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$791m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$6.1bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$11b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$40.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sealed Air as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.016. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Sealed AirStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Packaging market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

What better way to show off how cool your aging 40-year-old-plus self is in the office than by rocking a pair of sweet Nike dunks a day after the manufacturer served up lackluster guidance and the stock sank?Interestingly, the Foot Locker store where I got these pricey fountains of youth was generally empty. The July Fourth weekend is usually a hotbed of buying activity for things you don't really need but rather want. And maybe it was in other states, just not at this particular store at this particular moment in time.morning brief imageWhat wasn't empty on July Fourth weekend? The two no-frills Marshalls locations (owned and operated by TJX Companies) I popped into for some silverware — one on Saturday and the other on Sunday. Both stores looked as if angry bulls had run amok in the aisles — everything was that messy and picked over. Cut in line at your own risk, the places were mobbed with deal seekers.These three holiday occurrences sent me back to reconnect on the state of consumer stocks ahead of the pivotal back-to-school shopping season.I was reminded how hated consumer names are right now, as seen in new Bank of America data.Consumer discretionary stocks are at the lowest exposure among hedge fund managers and long-only managers in the history of Bank of America's data set.""Resilient consumption in the face of inflation pressures, a slackening labor market, and a host of other factors is seen as unsustainable by most portfolio managers,"" said BofA's top equity strategist Savita Subramanian.Story continuesSubramanian added, ""faith in the consumer is waning.""Ouch.The top 20 most-shorted S&amp;P 500 stocks — as presented by BofA — are dominated by companies deemed consumer discretionary.The top five includes Dish Network (you definitely don't need expensive Dish Network services); Ralph Lauren (don't need an $80 polo shirt from Macy's); CarMax (you can live with your 100,000-mile road warrior a little longer in a land of higher financing costs); Paramount (do you really need Paramount+?); CH Robinson (a logistics play that ships stuff you probably don't need).This positioning reeks of investors banking on a second-half consumer collapse.But perhaps all of this negativity on the consumer shouldn't come as a surprise.The jobs market is slowing. Stories about AI taking jobs continue to populate (here's what musician and tech investor will.i.am told us recently on the topic). Headline-grabbing layoffs continue to rip through the economy (see Disney's ESPN ""talent"" cuts).Further, nagging inflation has eaten into the trillions of dollars in pandemic savings.The personal savings rate sits at 4.6%, down from double-digits at the height of the pandemic and below the long-run average of 8.3%.Can't spend much if your paycheck is barely making ends meet and your savings account is as dried up as the Sahara.Should you be using this juncture to go against the crowd and scoop up retailers and other consumer-centric stocks? Beats me. I just buy Nike dunks and do news — I don't pick stocks anymore.I will say this though: It's hard to get too excited about many of these names in front of potentially two more interest rate hikes, a down-trending personal savings rate, and sticky inflation.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

In the US alone, it accounted for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021, and in the electricity sector, it accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production.In 2022, fuel prices including natural gas peaked due to the Russia-Ukraine war which led to sanctions on Russia, resulting in pressure on European and global gas markets. However, due to favorable weather conditions and actions taken by the governments, the pressure on the market eased a little since the beginning of 2023. In Europe, natural gas consumption fell by almost 55 billion cubic meters year-over-year during the 2022/2023 heating season, marking the steepest decline in consumption for any recorded winter season. Furthermore, to avoid further pressures due to the cut-off from Russian exports, the European Union has also unveiled a 210 billion euro plan to completely be rid of Russian fossil fuel dependence by 2027. Compared to 2022, the Russian pipeline gas consumption is expected to drop around 45% in 2023. Nevertheless, In Asia and the Middle East, the natural gas demand is expected to increase by 3% and 2%, respectively, The higher demand from these regions will offset most of the drop in demand from Europe and the US in 2023 which is expected to decline by 5% and 2%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2023, the natural gas average price at Henry Hub was $2.55 per Metric Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), which showed an almost 40% YoY decline and a 57% sequential decline. The natural gas price was $4.55 per MMBtu in Q1 2022 and $5.92 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2022. Between mid-December and the first quarter of 2023, natural gas prices dropped by around 70% in Northeast Asian, North American, and European markets.Story continuesThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its short-term energy outlook on June 6 which reveals that the US natural gas production set a monthly record in April with 104 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) production. In the previous month, it was 102 billion cubic feet per day. The EIA expects natural gas production to average around 103 Bcfd in the second half of 2023. According to the EIA’s outlook, natural gas prices are expected to remain conservative in the second half of the year too with an estimated $2.60 per MMBtu average price in the third quarter of 2023. One of the main reasons for these low prices is overstocked inventory. In May, natural gas storage inventories were 15% above the 5-year average.Despite having a rough time, natural gas prices can still increase over time as it has been a key source of fuel in reducing global carbon emissions. On top of that, if a dry or hotter-than-usual summer comes along and gets followed by a cold winter, the commodity can experience high price volatility. On June 26, natural gas futures to their peak in two months and have since dropped by 6.8% on June 30.Even though natural gas prices are under pressure due to several factors, the commodity is still expected to play a huge role in the energy industry until renewable energy completely takes over fossil fuels. Due to low prices, natural gas stocks are also experiencing a decline in their stock prices. To take advantage of the situation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best stocks to look out for.10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Nowvovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we chose the natural gas companies according to their hedge fund sentiment as of the first quarter of 2022.

Morgan Stanley raises Microsoft's price target to $415. JetBlue ends its alliance with American Airlines as it pursues an acquisition of Spirit Airlines. Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita check out several top trending stocks after Thursday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: That closes out today's trading action. All three of the major averages under pressure following that very strong ADP report before the bell. The Dow closing off its lows of the day, off just around 365 points. S&amp;P off about 8/10 of percent as well as the NASDAQ.Let's take a look at some of the trending tickers. The top one on Yahoo Finance today, Affirm, the stock sliding roughly 10% after a downgrade to underweight from neutral. Piper Sandler, the analyst there citing higher rates. Also the restart of student loan payments as a couple of headwinds here facing Affirm.He also talked about, Akiko, some competition. We know Apple Pay later the new entrant into that space bringing up some questions just about their ability to attain that revenue growth that they've laid out in terms of their forecast.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, competition a big one. But higher rates, you could argue even bigger when you think about the impact it's likely to have on Affirm. The analyst specifically, saying, that Affirm relies on loan sales to drive a huge part of their revenue.And if you look at where the company is right now, they've increasingly held on to some of those loans on their balance sheet with higher rates. That's an even bigger concern. And you see that downgrade today reflected in the stock at least down about 10 and 1/2%.We are also watching Microsoft shares a top performer on the Dow today. Morgan Stanley raising its price target on the stock, naming it a top pick in large cap software. Behind all of that, of course, optimism in Microsoft's AI exposure. We're talking specifically about OpenAI, ChatGPT.Story continuesBy the way, Morgan Stanley increasing their price target by roughly 24%. Huge upside there. They say specifically that Microsoft is poised to top a $3 trillion valuation in early 2024 because of the big bump they're getting from AISEANA SMITH: Yeah. Akiko, they're not buying the fact that there's some concern out there that Microsoft is overvalued at this point. Lots of concern about whether the AI hype has been overdone. They're really reiterating the fact that they believe that Microsoft is a leader in this space and what's driving that narrative. This is a team led by Keith Weiss.Is that their best position in software to monetize some of the expansion that they are expected to see as the automated workflow, that's a result of generative AI. As we talk about the fact that generative AI is going to disrupt jobs and how people think about jobs and do their jobs.Morgan Stanley making the argument that Microsoft is best positioned to capitalize on that. We know obviously Microsoft has been really pushing even further into the AI space working it into various parts of their business, overhauling their entire lineup of office apps. So Morgan Stanley thinking that they are going to remain the leader in the space, at least for now.We're also keeping a close eye on shares of JetBlue. The company announcing that it's going to end its alliance with American Airlines in the northeast. JetBlue saying that it will focus on its acquisition of Spirit, so a bit of a shift here from the airline. Not necessarily a surprise.We know they have been really focusing on Spirit and what exactly that's going to do for their business going forward. A 7% drop though, in the stock today. Akiko, one of the biggest drops that we've seen and biggest intraday drop since MarchAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I'm a little surprised by the drop because to your point, Seana, is so much of this and the potential for that alliance coming to an end came up during the whole acquisition, talking whether, in fact, JetBlue was finally going to acquire Spirit, which they did.You could have argued that was kind of priced in. But I mean, I guess at least if you look at where the stock is right now, pointing to potentially a bumpy road ahead.SEANA SMITH: Yeah there are some optimists out there. They were holding on to hope. They didn't want to buy the headlines and certainly we are seeing a sell the news type of reaction today.]"

See our latest analysis for Paychex Is Paychex Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Paychex seems to be fairly priced at around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Paychex today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $128.70, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Paychex’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What kind of growth will Paychex generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Paychex's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 26%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PAYX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PAYX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

Finding growth stocks with dividends.Many times, companies don’t start paying a dividend until the businesses have matured. That doesn’t mean that they have no more growth in them, but it does mean that the days of rapid growth are no longer there.Instead, the company looks for steady growth while finding ways to return capital to shareholders. Finding a balance between growth and dividend consistency is tough. Not many companies can become strong dividend candidates and continue to grow at a level considered impressive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, some growth stocks have made this transition relatively well and now boast nice dividend streaks to boot. Admittedly, they’re not the types of streaks we see with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) or McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), but they are something to take note of.Let’s look at a few growth stocks with dividends.Growth Stocks With Dividends: Starbucks (SBUX)Source: ShutterstockStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a name that’s tough to ignore. It has cemented itself as a top consumer brand, both in the U.S. and abroad. China has become the company’s second-largest market, and it helped fuel the company to a top- and bottom-line beat last quarter.While management did speak cautiously about China going forward, its outlook was still solid. Nike (NYSE:NKE) just reported earnings and showed strength in China too, so there’s hope that the consumer can continue to do well over there.So what makes it a growth stock?Analysts expect Starbucks to generate roughly 11.5% revenue growth in 2023 and 2024. That’s to go alongside earnings growth of 16% this year and almost 20% next year.As for its dividend, the stock yields about 2.2%. However, management has made the dividend a real priority over the years with a five-year dividend growth rate of 12.6%.A Dividend King Enters: Sysco (SYY)Sysco (SYY) logo on a sign with company headquarters in Houston in the background.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comStory continuesSysco (NYSE:SYY) has quietly become a dividend stud. It has paid its dividend out for decades now and has become a consistent stock for income-oriented and long-term investors. Despite being a public company since 1971, Sysco still has quite a bit of growth left.Analysts expect almost 12% revenue growth this year and more than 20% earnings growth. In 2024, earnings estimates dip but still stand at an impressive 12%. For this, investors are paying just over 18 times earnings.Despite being public for more than 50 years and garnering a $37 billion market capitalization, many investors aren’t quite sure what the company does. In Sysco’s own words:“Sysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food and non-food products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other customers around the world.”Playing Defense With Growth: Raytheon (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaytheon (NYSE:RTX) has also become a force to reckon with. The stock has been trading better lately, but it’s still well off its highs. For long-term investors with some patience, this could be an opportunity.Despite sporting a $143 billion market cap, it often feels like Raytheon is overlooked.Shares trade at less than 20 times earnings despite high-single-digit revenue growth forecasts for 2023 and 2024. While analysts expect just 5% earnings growth this year, consensus expectations call for an acceleration up to 15% growth in 2024.The stock pays out a 2.4% dividend yield and recently gave that dividend payout a 7.3% boost in April. According to the company, “Raytheon Technologies has paid cash dividends on its common stock every year since 1936”.Another interesting note? Raytheon has better gross margin and profit margin than Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD).On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

74,021ba320-8e1f-3ef1-875d-6114d40e52cb,ADM,2023-07-07,Investing in Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) three years ago would have delivered you a 110% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-archer-daniels-midland-nyse-110126520.html,1688727686,STORY,['ADM'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) share price is up 96% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 31% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 7.2% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Archer-Daniels-Midland was able to grow its EPS at 44% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 9.42 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Archer-Daniels-Midland's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Archer-Daniels-Midland's TSR for the last 3 years was 110%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveArcher-Daniels-Midland shareholders gained a total return of 7.2% during the year. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 13% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland   you should know about.But note: Archer-Daniels-Midland may not be the best stock to buy.

79,9c9da722-aafb-37e0-97ae-c8b3fde74ad1,PM,2023-07-07,Investors Could Be Concerned With Philip Morris International's (NYSE:PM) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-could-concerned-philip-morris-130134319.html,1688648494,STORY,['PM'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Looking at Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Philip Morris International:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.30 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 30%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceIn the above chart we have measured Philip Morris International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Philip Morris International Tell Us?In terms of Philip Morris International's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 45%, but they have dropped over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays.

82,9f672892-a37f-3695-afcd-016057ca16dc,HCA,2023-07-07,UnitedHealth's (UNH) Suffering Continues: Should You Hold Tight?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealths-unh-suffering-continues-hold-160100127.html,1688659260,STORY,"['UNH', 'UHS', 'HCA']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is currently under pressure. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, a massive player ($444.9 billion market cap) in the HMO space, has contributed its fair share in that downfall. The questions investors are now asking are: what is going wrong with the company? When will the downfall end? Is there a ray of sunshine on the horizon?Let’s go through the headwinds first.Over the year-to-date period, UnitedHealth shares declined 11.1% compared with the 10.1% and 3.7% fall of the HMO industry and the overall medical sector, respectively. Despite the medical sector’s pull, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has jumped 17.1% during this time, thanks to gains recorded primarily in information technology, as well as communication services sectors.YTD PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast month, UnitedHealth leadership pointed out at the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference that seniors are now undergoing elective surgeries, which were delayed due to the pandemic. This is bound to accelerate medical costs. Our estimate for 2023 medical costs indicates almost 12% year-over-year growth, which will put pressure on margins.Furthermore, higher operating costs and the cost of products sold will likely add to the woe. Our prediction for UNH's total operating costs for 2023 suggests an 11% increase from a year ago. Following UnitedHealth, another industry player, Humana Inc. HUM, signaled a higher-than-expected increase in non-inpatient utilization trends, which will push its benefit expense ratio for the year toward the upper limit of its guided range of 86.3-87.3%.UnitedHealth's international operations continue to witness a decline in membership growth. Even in the first quarter of 2023, membership in its international business dropped 3.7% year over year. This trend will likely affect its premium growth, putting pressure on its global business. Moreover, looking at its 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple, investors might hesitate to pay any further premium. The company currently has a ratio of 17.86X, higher than the industry average of 16.72X.Story continuesThis Too Shall PassThe growth rate in medical costs is expected to gradually minimize as demand for elected procedures normalizes. Our estimate for UNH's 2024 medical costs suggests a little more than 1% year-over-year growth. This means more premiums will remain in hand after paying for the procedures for the health insurer.Rising medical costs are nothing new for health insurers. To reduce the risks related to such events, the companies diversify their operations. As a prime example, UnitedHealth's Optum Health unit is likely to witness higher utilization, especially in ambulatory surgery operations, from the resumption of elective procedures. This will significantly offset the negatives being faced by UnitedHealthcare, its health benefits business.Each sub-segment of Optum, UnitedHealth's health service business, is expected to continue delivering a solid performance, driving the overall segment's growth. Our estimate for 2023 operating income from the segment indicates an almost 11% year-over-year jump. Broadening of pharmacy care services and consistent strengthening of care delivery services will likely be the tailwinds for Optum's sub-segments.UnitedHealth's financial strength enables it to navigate through tough times with ease. Its healthy balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $46.5 billion at the first-quarter end was significantly higher than the short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt of $9.9 billion. Also, UNH's free cash flow after dividends in the trailing 12-month period soared 61% to $28 billion.Its financial flexibility and operating strength allow it to boost shareholder values. Last month, UnitedHealth hiked its quarterly dividend by 14% to $1.88 per share, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend hikes. It also has a well-established history of engaging in share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the company rewarded its stakeholders with buybacks of $2 billion.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth's 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.86 per share, indicating a 12% year-over-year rise. The estimate remained stable over the past week. For 2024, the consensus mark suggests an 11.8% year-over-year jump. The company beat earnings estimates in all the last four quarters, with an average of 4%. The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $364.9 billion, suggesting 12.6% growth from a year ago.Bottom LineWhile UnitedHealth remains an appealing investment option for the long haul, thanks to its new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings and operations, short-term uncertainties persist. Washington's scrutiny of pharmacy benefit managers and concerns related to potential changes in Medicare and Medicaid are putting pressure on companies like UnitedHealth. Despite these near-term hiccups, UNH is worth holding onto. Those who haven't invested in the stock yet, could wait for a greater pullback and grab the stock at a better entry point.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader medical space may look at better-ranked players like HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA and Universal Health Services, Inc. UHS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Headquartered in Nashville, TN, HCA Healthcare operates hospitals and related healthcare entities. The company's prudent acquisitions, rising admissions, diversified business and capital deployment are expected to drive long-term growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $18.10 per share, indicating a 7.2% improvement from the year-ago level. The consensus estimate for HCA’s revenues in 2023 suggests a 5.3% year-over-year rise.King of Prussia, PA-based Universal Health Services operates acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers and other facilities through its subsidiaries. Consistent top-line growth, strong capital position, accretive acquisitions and a solid acute care platform are key positives for the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health Services’ 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.27 per share, signaling 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for UHS’ revenues in 2023 is pegged at $14.1 billion, indicating a 5.4% increase from the year-ago level.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 6.8%.Healthy Growth PotentialThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is currently pegged at $7.25, implying year-over-year growth of 19.8%.

The company recently reached its 52-week high of $149.66 on Jul 3, indicating positive market sentiment and upward momentum.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrategic Actions &amp; Acquisitions to Drive ResultsPPG Industries is currently experiencing several positive factors that are driving its growth and performance. One key factor is the implementation of higher pricing across its various segments, which has contributed to increased revenues and improved profitability. Additionally, the company is focused on enhancing its manufacturing efficiencies and cost discipline, leading to greater operational effectiveness and cost savings.To address the challenges posed by weak demand in Europe and China, PPG has taken proactive measures. The company has implemented a comprehensive cost-cutting and restructuring strategy, aiming to optimize its working capital requirements and generate significant cost savings. These restructuring initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on PPG's financial performance, with an anticipated incremental restructuring savings of $10-$15 million in the second quarter of 2023.Story continuesFurthermore, PPG has been actively countering the impact of cost inflation in raw materials, energy, and logistics by raising selling prices across its business segments. This strategic approach, combined with improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost discipline, led to a substantial increase in profits during the first quarter. The company foresees these pricing measures to continue to support its margins in the remainder of 2023.In its pursuit of sustainable growth, PPG is actively engaged in value-creating acquisitions. Notable acquisitions such as Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon are expected to contribute to the company's top line in 2023, further expanding its market presence and diversifying its product offerings.The company is committed to enhancing shareholder returns. In 2022, the company returned approximately $570 million to shareholders through dividends and $190 million through share repurchases.

Foster Company FSTR, a leading global technology solutions provider for the rail and infrastructure markets, has announced the completion of the sale of substantially all the assets of its prestressed concrete railroad tie business in Spokane, WA to voestalpine Railway Systems Nortrak, LLC.

The divested business was part of the company’s Rail, Technologies, and Services segment.The sale of the concrete rail tie operations was executed through L.B. Foster's subsidiary, CXT, Incorporated. The divestment includes all owned inventory associated with the business and related fixed assets, while the company retains pre-closing accounts receivable and liabilities. This strategic move aligns with L.B. Foster's strategic transformation initiatives.Although the concrete rail tie business generated revenues of roughly $9 million over the trailing 12 months ended Jun 30, 2023, the divestment will not materially impact L.B.

Michele Schneider, Marketgauge.com Chief Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss big banks setting the tone for earnings, as well as what to expect from AI stocks, consumer-facing companies, airlines, oil, and gas.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]DIANE KING HALL: A new earnings season just around the corner. And as usual, big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup will kick off the busy quarter next week.But Wall Street's biggest banks might be facing tighter profit margins following the aftermath of the banking crisis and collapse of Silicon Valley Bank back in March.Now some analysts are painting a gloomy picture for this quarter, saying Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. Michele Schneider, MarketGauge.com Chief Strategist is still here with us. So Michele, do you agree with that assessment?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, if we look at what had boosted the bank earnings in the past, a lot of it was from their financial side, right? From people-- from people being involved in investments and that liquidity that it added to banks.And also being able to borrow money, which right now is much more difficult that these higher interest rates. And even though the housing market has been strong, obviously mortgage applications have been impacted by rising rates.So yeah, at this point, I would think that for this quarter, we will not necessarily see very strong bank earnings. And you mentioned the banking crisis. I mean, some people feel that it was just a little bit too soon in terms of saying crisis over. I mean, what did it last? Like about four days.And so the higher the interest rates go, that could put a lot of squeeze particularly on the commercial real estate and the regional bank side. So I would not have great high expectations at this point.BRAD SMITH: Do you think there's a theme that emerges this earnings season? It seemed like last earnings season, it was all about how can we say AI in various amount of ways for companies who had no business saying it in some of them. So Michele, is there one theme that you believe will emerge this earnings season?Story continuesMICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, again, I think that you have-- the advantage is going to be to any of these companies that have managed to survive throughout the first six months because of their operating cash flow. And that has given them some level of growth.And that's why you have to mention AI, right? Because that certainly has happened there. So that's kind of what I would continue to look at. I mean, just take Nike in terms of the consumer space, right? Earnings not great and Nike stock has been falling.So if that's any kind of foreshadowing, that means that we will see a lot of stress in terms of the earnings. And it's going to be, of course, what they say about future as we get through the rest of the year.And at this point, right now, with the expectations of two more interest rate hikes and as we've talked about already, inflation not necessarily being in control, at least in the places that affect consumers the worst, yeah, I would think that we'll see AI probably still do well.Apple, all these companies as they continue to compete with one another. But a lot of the other companies not necessarily doing so great.DIANE KING HALL: So can you name more of those companies, besides Nike, that where you expect to see some stress. Would these be consumer company-- consumer-facing companies or where are you expecting to see this stress?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, we started with banks so I think the banks can set the tone for sure. And if they do not come in great or worse than expected, right?I mean, the thing with earnings seasons, first of all, is that it's always looking backwards and it's really about what the actual number is versus the expectation that has the greatest impact to the market. And even that is, sometimes, a short-term impact. So the longer term impact generally is what they project going forward, the guidance.And so, yeah, I mean-- I mean, like, let's take some of the high flyers in terms of the consumer space that we've seen in the past, Lululemon being one. I think that those kind of companies could actually start to feel the strain.Whereas some of the fast food companies that had had stress could actually start to come back a little bit. You know, like a McDonald's, for example.So I think that that's really-- you have to think what's going to be if everything we've just talked about, Diane, turns out to be true. If the market has seen a top. If the yields are going to have to be stretched. If we are going to enter more stagflation, potentially recession as we get into 2024.Where are these company-- where are people are going to spend their money? And they're going to spend the money on more of the staples, which did terribly, right? I mean Target, of course, had its own reasons for doing that outside of being Staples, which went down against discretionary. But that could rebound.A company like Walmart could continue to do well. You know, where people are going to go and buy cheapest goods they can get at this point.BRAD SMITH: Michele, just lastly while we're on this topic. One of my favorite conversations to kick off the earnings season is with Delta's executives.Because it gives us a sense of where this counter-cyclical recovery that we've heard about from travel companies is continuing or what type of consumer profile they're continuing to engage with.Particularly across services spending right now in the experience economy, are you expecting for there to be any slowdown within that?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, it's such a good question, Brad, because we actually were in the cruise line stocks and had taken some profits along the way.And I've talked to people who do go on a lot of cruises. They said they're booked out for at least the next year. And so again, at this point, that still could be an outperforming area as people seem to be cutting back in certain things but yet wanting to get out, wanting to get away, wanting to go on a cruise, wanting to get on a plane.Do I think that can be impacted? Of course. As we know, when things get sour, if they go sour, it's really hard for anything, particularly in this more sort of discretionary area, to sustain.And then we have this other kind of crazy thing going on which is the possibility of labor unrest as wages continue to have to increase to keep up. And you know, you had a strike right now in UPS and I think it's still out there. And there's been threats of airline strikes.So I think I wouldn't necessarily be all that overly optimistic anywhere when it comes to the equity space, even in the airlines and the cruise lines.DIANE KING HALL: Interesting. So maybe some caution ahead. All right, Michele Schneider, thank you so much. We appreciate you for joining us today. Michele Schneider, MarketGauge.com Chief Strategist.MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Thank you.]"

Marcus Collins, University of Michigan Ross School of Business Marketing Professor, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the marketing phenomena surrounding the doll-inspired film, commenting on the cultural presence it has taken on and how well it will draw in moviegoers.Video Transcript- Hey, Barbie, can I come to your house tonight?- Sure. I don't have anything big planned, just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies and plan choreography and a bespoke song. You should stop by.- So cool.(SINGING) You can find me under the lights, diamonds under my eyes.- This is the best day ever.- It is the best day ever. So is yesterday, and so is tomorrow and every day from now till forever. You guys ever think about dying?- Mattel's hotly anticipated Barbie movie comes out in two weeks, and the hype around it, well, it couldn't be more real. The movie has an estimated $100 million budget, according to Variety, and is tracking for an estimated $70 million plus opening. Well, the excitement started over a year ago, with Mattel's release of this image right here of Margot Robbie as Barbie.And from there, well, fans certainly got lost in the pink glittery Barbie world. 2022 was the year of Barbie core a fashion trend, spotted on Valentino's runway in the fall and also embraced by a number of celebrities including Lizzo, Anne Hathaway, and Zendaya. Well, hashtag, #barbiecore has over 420 million views on TikTok, and the marketing is everywhere.Mattel released a line of Margot Robbie Barbie dolls. And as apparel collabs with GAP, Forever 21, and Hot Topic, Bloomingdale's is doing a Barbie-themed pop-up shop. Well, that is not all a luggage collaboration, custom Xbox controllers, a makeup collection, Uno Cards, and Aldo shoes.Progressive, getting in on the fun with a commercial about ensuring Barbie's dreamhouse. And Barbie's house is even up for rent on AirBnb. Well, we decided to get out on the streets in New York City and see what people think of the movie's marketing techniques.Story continues- The marketing is amazing. I saw the little Ken house AirBnb. I love that. I think the marketing was awesome.- I like the marketing. It's a little cheesy.- I see a lot of marketing about it, even like this Barbie and Ken thing they have going on and on the billboards. It's--- Really?- Yeah, it's pretty out there, man.- We're staying in Times Square, so we see the big billboards, with all the pink and all the actors and actresses. The marketing is pretty epic.- I just feel like I've been inundated with Barbie stuff. I'm almost over it, and it hasn't even opened yet.- The marketing, like the ad with her foot up, that's what got me for real.- Well, let's talk more about this viral marketing campaign. We want to bring in Marcus Collins, University of Michigan Ross School of Business marketing professor, also author of ""For the Culture."" Marcus, it's great to have you here. So even just what we're hearing from people on the street, it almost seems like everyone has heard that the ""Barbie"" movie is hitting theaters in just two weeks. What do you think it is about this marketing technique that has made it so effective?- I think that, one, they've borrowed on the equity, the capital that is Barbie. This is a well-known, well-beloved brand that's now being contemporaries, which is actually really cool. But I like the way they brought the brand to market by marketing the movie like it was a Disney movie, right?They find all these different partners that could benefit from the movie, winning. You find complements, the peanut butter to their jelly, if you will. That if the movie does well, these other brands do well. And finding different cultural aspects that the brand the movie could be a part of, the conversation, the cultural discourse will create much more opportunity for people to find out about the movie and, hopefully, for the brand, at least, people to know more about the movie.- Marcus, how much of this, though, hinges? When you talk about the potential success of it all, does it hinge on people actually going out and watching the movie? Because as you pointed out in your notes, like there could be a lot of hype, there could be a lot of interest, But if that doesn't translate into people going into the theaters and watching this movie. What does it ultimately mean?- Yeah. I mean, this is, sort of, the double-edged sword that, sometimes, the marketing be so good, that it overshadows the movie, that people get so enamored, so excited about the marketing for the movie, they never show up at the theater.And that's the part that gives me a little bit of pause when I think about the excitement that's happening around all the marketing for the ""Barbie"" movie is that there's a lot of talk about how cool the marketing is, how it's showing up in all these different places.Yet, I haven't heard a lot of the discourse in the social channels, at least, about people saying, I can't wait for it to come out. I've already bought my ticket. I'm so there. Who's going with me? There's not a lot of intent signaling.In fact, if you look at Google Trends, the search traffic, a lot of the search queries are about all the marketing partnerships, not about the movie per se. And since the core product is the movie, that should draw a little bit of pause for the folks who are putting this thing in the world.- Marcus, have you seen this much excitement around a movie like this? I need to draw the comparison to what we've seen from Disney movies, but I'm scratching my head. I'm struggling to really think of another movie that has gotten this much attention, this many brand partnerships ahead of its release. Is this almost unheard of?- It happens rarely outside of Marvel movies and Disney movies, which is Disney, of course. But I think about-- the last time I've seen something in this kind of capacity, this kind of fidelity would probably be the ""Stranger Things"" season 3, I think that was, when they partnered with all those different brands, like Burger King, Baskin-Robbins, LEGO, Microsoft, Coca-Cola.All these brands got into the launch of this new platform. I think it's the last time I've seen that outside of a superhero movie or a Disney film. But even then, when we see these brands work with movie releases in this way, they don't always mean success, meaning most recently, look at the ""Buzz Lightyear"" film that came out last year, just recently.They had a lot of traction behind it, a lot of different brand partnerships. It was on cereal boxes. It was the McDonald's toys, but they didn't convert into actual ticket sales. And that's what we're after. How do we turn all of this cultural conversations, how do we turn into intent that ultimately leads to action?- The movie aside, though, there's also the question about what this means for Mattel, the brand, and their ability to be able to connect with potentially newer generation and get that runway going or extend the runway for Barbie. Our Brian Sozzi and Brad Smith sat down with Mattel's CEO earlier, asked him about how important the movie is for the brand beyond dolls. Take a listen to what he had to say.- The next chapter of that is going to be unlocking the value of this IP through storytelling, whether it's theatrical, television, live action, content, gaming, live experiences, all of the different category partnerships that we've created in consumer products, where this movie is really a catalyst for future monetization in the consumer product space, apparel, sporting goods, home, accessories.- So Marcus, that was a conversation over at Cannes Lions, but can Mattel build on this? Can they already can claim this as a win, just given how much they've already made-- the brands made its way into the conversation?- Oh, absolutely. Mattel has definitely won in this regard. It reminds me of the music industry that, nowadays, people release albums. So they can go on tour. And in this way, Mattel releasing this movie, whether it succeeds at the box office, it's a mega success or not, the fact that it has contemporaries the brand and introduced it to new people who weren't even thinking about or talking about Barbie is definitely a win for the IP.It creates a new canvas for it to draw and to create new ways to engage with the brand. As the CEO mentioned, whether it's through product, whether it's through more toys, whether it's through more movies, through gaming and the like, I mean that the possibilities are endless, now that it's creating a new chapter for people to see the world of Barbie. Barbie is now has a new cultural lens to it. Now whether the movie is a success or not, it still benefits from that win.- Marcus, what do you think we're going to see moving forward, when you take into account some of the other legacy brands out there, some of the lessons that they can learn from this Barbie revival. How does that shape, do you think, future marketing campaigns?- Well, it's all, kind of, creating a blueprint. For the ones that fail, you go, I know what not to do. And the ones that succeed, you go, I know what to pick from that. But I think what ultimately matters, we're bringing new ideas to the marketplace through marketing communications. It requires some familiarity and some novelty.So we can borrow from things that worked in the past and create new builds on top of it. I mean, even the AI meme generator that Barbie used back in April, I think, that was, we saw that happen with ""Straight Outta Compton"" for the biopic for NWA happened some years ago.Same idea, but a new wrapper, a new lens on it. So when we pair familiarity with some novelty, it creates a great opportunity to get people's attention, but ultimately get people to talk, and then, prayerfully, get people to take action.- Marcus, you just cued up the segment nicely for us, when you talk about memes. We couldn't do the segment without getting in on the action. So can we pull that up? There's one for me. Look, Shawna is-- what is this?- I'm hitting the dance floor.- And mine says, this Barbie is an optimist. I'd say that's pretty accurate. Have you made your meme, Marcus? Have you played around?- I made my meme. I did make my meme that said, this Barbie is all smiles.- Oh, there you go. There you go. Perfectly done. Marcus Collins, it is great to talk to you today. We'll all be watching to see if the success translates to success over at the box office. Thanks so much for that.- Absolutely.]"

Diversified portfolios of multiline insurers minimize concentration risks and hence, provides an impetus to their premiums. For constructing such efficient portfolios, industry players often resort to mergers and acquisitions and a solid capital position backs them to undertake such growth-related initiatives.Industry participants with exposure to property and casualty (“P&amp;C”) business line might reap the benefit of rate increases in property and personal lines. Significant rate hikes will outstrip the claim costs and hence, drive the underwriting results of multiline insurers. Per Swiss Re, the U.S. P&amp;C insurance premiums are expected to improve 7.5% in 2023 followed by a 5.5% rise in 2024.Though catastrophe losses come with its own share of worries, they usually ramp up the policy renewal rate, thereby leading to a better pricing environment.Improved interest rates boost investment yields for those insurers that have exposure to rate-sensitive products. After three rate hikes so far in 2023, the Fed finally put a temporary halt to its rate-hiking spree in the June meeting. Nevertheless, it signaled two probable rate hikes this year. An aging U.S. population and a high mortality rate observed nationwide are likely to have sustained the solid demand for insurance and protection products of life insurers in the days ahead.Auto premiums are aided by an increasing number of cars plying on roads — owing to people's confidence in traveling — and the easing of inflationary headwinds. Resumption of commercial and industrial activities in full swing are expected to keep the demand for workers compensation insurance high in the days ahead.Story continuesPrudent technology investments in blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation boosts margins of multiline insurers by bringing about accelerated claim payments and automation in processes.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector gained 5.3% in the past three months compared with the sector’s growth of 6.1%.

Evidently, AIG has the edge over MET here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise track helps investors get an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.MET’s bottom line beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average surprise being 0.70%. AIG’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 9.22%. Thus, American International has a better reading than MetLife on this front.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a profitability measure, which indicates how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders' funds.MetLife's ROE of 16.9% compares favorably with American International’s ROE of 8.6% and remains higher than the industry’s average of 9.8%.ValuationPrice-to-book (P/B) value is the best multiple used for valuing insurance stocks. Compared with MET’s forward 12-month P/B ratio of 1.34, AIG is cheaper, with a reading of 0.91. The multiline insurance industry’s P/B ratio is 2.28.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe lower the debt-to-equity ratio, the better for the company as it implies a sound solvency level. American International’s leverage ratio of 56.2% remains lower than MetLife’s ratio of 57.5% and the industry’s average of 60.5%. Therefore, AIG holds an edge over MET in this case.Dividend YieldBoth companies are regular dividend payers. MetLife’s dividend yield of 3.7% betters American International’s metric of 2.5% and is higher than the industry’s average of 2.7%. MET wins over AIG on this front.Robust 2023 ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MetLife’s 2023 earnings indicates a year-over-year improvement of 12.9%, while the same for American International suggests a 42.9% year-over-year growth this year. Thus, AIG has the edge over MET here.Long-Term Growth ProjectionBoth stocks' expected long-term earnings growth rate is lower than the industry’s average of 12.1%. However, the metric for MetLife is pegged at 11.2%, better than American International’s figure of 10%.VGM ScoreThe VGM Score rates each stock on its combined weighted styles, helping identify those with the most attractive value, the best growth and the most promising momentum. MetLife and American International have an unimpressive VGM Score of C, faring equally on this front.Insurance PremiumsOne of the major contributors to an insurer’s revenues is its premiums. The metric for MetLife declined 9.7% year over year in the first quarter of 2023, while the same for American International improved 19.1% year over year in the same time frame. Thus. AIG is the winner in this context.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that American International is better poised than MetLife for its price performance, earnings surprise, valuation, debt-to-equity ratio, 2023 prospects and insurance premiums. MET scores higher in terms of ROE, expected long-term growth forecast and dividend yield. With the scale tipping majorly toward AIG, the stock appears to be better poised.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

95,8c3c2308-ccb6-30b1-bc5e-8fc9f35ef222,HOLX,2023-07-07,Reasons to Retain AMN Healthcare (AMN) Stock in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-retain-amn-healthcare-amn-152100699.html,1688656860,STORY,"['AMN', 'HOLX', 'BSX', 'HQY']","[AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad array of services. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its healthcare Managed Services Program (“MSP”) are expected to contribute further. However, healthcare industry regulations and stiff competition are major downsides.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 2.2% compared with the 16.9% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 13.8% growth in the said time frame.The renowned player in the healthcare total talent services space has a market capitalization of $4.29 billion. The company projects 3.3% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. AMN Healthcare surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 10.5%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Array of Services: We are optimistic about AMN Healthcare’s business’ gradual evolution beyond traditional healthcare staffing. The company has become a strategic total talent solutions partner for its clients. Its suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes MSPs, vendor management systems and medical language interpretation services.On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, management confirmed that the company is continuing to elevate AMN Passport to be a digital staffing solution for all healthcare jobseekers at any stage of their careers across all businesses of AMN Healthcare.Healthcare MSP: AMN Healthcare’s unique MSP is helping the company gain market traction. Notably, the program helps streamline the entire workforce planning process, which facilitates the delivery of improved patient care. This has resulted in a large network of improved patient care and efficiency.In 2022, AMN Healthcare had approximately $5.3 billion in spend under management through its MSPs, and approximately 64% of its consolidated revenues flowed through MSP relationships.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Per management, the Technology and Workforce Solutions and Physician and Leadership Solutions segments exceeded expectations in the first quarter of 2023. The continued strength in AMN Healthcare’s Language Services also looks promising. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well.DownsidesHealthcare Industry Regulations: AMN Healthcare provides talent solutions and technologies on a contractual basis to its clients who pay the company directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact the company. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for AMN’s services.Stiff Competition: AMN Healthcare faces significant competition in the Medical Services industry. The company competes in national, regional and local markets for healthcare organization clients and healthcare professionals. In the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business, it competes with a few national competitors, along with numerous smaller, regional and local companies.Estimate TrendAMN Healthcare has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 0.8% north to $8.35.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $987.9 million, suggesting a 30.8% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Nexstar Broadcasting Group has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Netflix has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that NXST's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.NXST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.71, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 39.58.

NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.66.Another notable valuation metric for NXST is its P/B ratio of 2.27. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

If you want to skip our analysis of the market that sees how major and mega cap stocks have dominated this year, head on over to 5 Best Major Stocks to Buy Now. 2023 has been the year of major stocks. Mega cap stocks such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have led the stock market in returns and as a result, have pushed the broader market into positive territory. To understand how, consider the fact that year to date, the three firm's shares have appreciated by 34.40%, 129%, and 53.9%, respectively. On the other side, the NASDAQ Composite index which is made of nearly all the stocks on the NASDAQ market is up by 33% year to date while the NASDAQ 100 index made of the largest non financial firms listed on the NASDAQ, is up by 40%.This surge in the fortune of technology companies is on the back of the biggest technology booms in recent history, namely artificial intelligence. Commonly called AI, artificial intelligence is simply advanced mathematics that is used to generate new outcomes or predictions based on patterns observed in previously known data sets. The biggest winner by far due to AI is none other than the semiconductor firm NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA designs and sells graphics processing units (GPUs) which are used to power up AI systems such as the popular ChatGPT platform. As its reward, investors have piled into NVIDIA's shares, with the stock up a whopping 196% year to date, having added nearly $281 to its current share price of $424. If you're interested in some great artificial intelligence stocks, do check out Top 10 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest In.This surge in major stocks has naturally made the founders of the companies unimaginably richer than they were at 2022 end when the technology industry as a whole was routed in an inflationary macroeconomic environment. For instance, Meta's founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is one of the youngest billionaires in the world, added $58.9 billion to his net worth, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s chief Mr. Elon Musk led the list of growth in riches as he saw his net worth grow by nearly a $100 billion. Tesla's shares are up by ~159% year to date, making it rank second only to NVIDIA when it comes to share price outperformance by major companies and stocks.Story continuesBut what about the future? After all, one of the most common mantras on the market is that 'past performance is not indicative of future returns.' Well, on this front, one strategy to study stock market movement is called trend analysis. This involves graphing out previous share price movements and using these to compute probabilities to guess what might take place in the future. These trends analyze investor sentiment on a mass scale and can help analyze whether market sentiment in a stock will sustain. If you're interested in learning more details about this, take a look at 10 Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.On this front, one of the pros in technical investment, Katie Stockton had some crucial insights to share in an interview with CNBC where she pointed out when her firm was able to guess that the S&amp;P500 index would soar to the heights that is today - fueled of course by mega cap stocks. She shared:You know, when we got the breakout, that's what changed things, in mid May we had the breakout above the 4,155. We were working under the assumption that that range [4,000] would hold and of course it did not. . .We're always just trying to put odds in our favor. Nobody knows what's gonna, you know, be the next month or the next year even. But we're trying to make sure that we have momentum gauges on our side, relative strength on our side, we want to make sure there's no big overbought/sell signals. So that's our charge. We wanna make sure that we have those things supporting the market. And when we do, we're bullish. When we don't, we shift back to bearish bias.So the breakout did yield an objective of about 4,510. That's also aligned with the resistance level through the Fibonacci retracements. So that would be a natural pace for a pullback to unfold more than what we've already seen. And yet, as long as the momentum is there, and as long as we don't have any big overbought sell signals, which we don't at this time, we want to stay with the bullish bias until it proves us otherwise until we see that loss of momentum. Because I think that this market is probably a very long term trading range. If you look at the monthly gauges, you'll see that they tend to flatten out. You look forward a couple of years. So to me, within that context, they have to have an intermediate term focus on momentum, and when we don't have that intermediate term momentum benefiting the market, we wanna be managing risk of course.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top major stocks to buy. Among these, some that are likely to catch your attention are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).12 Best Major Stocks to Buy NowOur Methodology To compile our list of the best major stocks to buy, we consulted two of the best performing indexes this year, the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ 100.

103,944faee3-3b9d-3a2b-bb55-7296936c1827,AMGN,2023-07-07,Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) shareholders have earned a 5.8% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-nasdaq-amgn-shareholders-earned-120038953.html,1688731238,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 12% in the last quarter. But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. Unfortunately its return of 14% is below the market return of 65%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Amgen In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Amgen achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 37% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 3% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Amgen the TSR over the last 5 years was 32%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmgen shareholders are down 7.3% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Amgen better, we need to consider many other factors.

If you want to skip our analysis of the natural resources industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Buy. Despite the fact that technology is king these days, humankind is reaching for the stars, and an infinite amount of information is available in the palm of the hand, the simple fact is that natural resources are the dominant factor that has contributed to progress.The world's cars run on fossil fuels, computers, and gadgets rely on copper, minerals, and other natural resources, and construction relies on lumber to build a large number of buildings. And even though renewable energy is all the buzz these days, petroleum products are still the go to choice for generating electricity and running airplanes and cars. The world's infrastructure is dependent on natural resources, and at least for the near term future, they are here to stay.This need for natural resources became even clearer in 2022 in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are two integral suppliers of gas, commodities, and other agricultural products. A conflict between the two shook up global supply chains for these valuable products. These effects were felt especially in Europe which had come to rely on cheap Russian gas to keep inflation down and fuel economic growth. The sum of the invasion's effects on the stock market involved primarily the shares of energy companies soaring at a time when their technology peers tanked. This share price growth also reaped dividends in literal form for investors, with Bloomberg reporting that during the three weeks that ended in September 2022 alone, energy companies paid out a massive $16.4 billion in dividends to mark a 15% sequential growth over the second quarter.Yet, natural resources also confer countries a predetermined advantage, unlike say innovation, which can surface in any country if the right conditions are in place. This also leaves some countries better off than others, and this dominance remains stable over the course of the years unless dramatic new discoveries are made. Our research of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources confirms this fact, as some of the largest countries in the world are also the richest. The top three countries are Russia, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia, with each having copious amounts of minerals, gas, and oil.Story continuesBuilding on this, the natural resources industry is also quite lucrative. One important natural resource industry is the mining sector. Research shows that this sector was worth $1.84 trillion in 2021 and was slated to grow to $2 trillion in 2022 to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. As opposed to some industries where the growth rate slows down over the passage of time, the case is the opposite in the mining industry which is slated to exhibit a CAGR of 12.9% to be worth $3.36 trillion by 2026. Naturally, this makes mining companies quite lucrative, with BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Glencore being the top three most valuable mining companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Moving towards one of the most important industries in the world, namely the energy industry, shows that this sector is worth trillions of dollars. For instance, the crude oil market alone was worth $2.7 trillion last year and is slated to grow to $2.9 trillion by the end of this year. From then on until 2027, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to be worth $3.7 trillion by then. For more details on the energy industry, be sure to check out Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World.Some top energy companies that we have identified are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). Combining these with the top mining companies named above lets us see what's going on in the industry right now. For instance, Shell announced in March that in addition to fueling gasoline vehicles, it will now also power electric cars after having completed the acquisition of Volta Inc in the U.S. This provides Shell access to a network of 3,000 charging points all over America, in more than 30 states as well as providing it the potential to expand this network by adding another 3,400 charging points. Taking a look at mining, BHP took the lead on the artificial intelligence front, when it announced in May that it has teamed up with Microsoft to use artificial intelligence and machine learning at the world's largest copper mine in Chile. Through this, the mining giant aims to improve production, contractor performance, and copper recovery from the site.As to what's on the minds of the companies themselves, here's what the management of Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:Following these principles, we’ve successfully won and advanced many clean energy projects, of which I’d like to highlight just a few. The left side represents projects currently under construction. These are projects with executed contracts, fixed payments and incremental growth with predictable returns. With project CapEx of just under $2 billion, including the new OCI project in Texas, where Linde will supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen by capturing CO2 for underground sequestration through our partner, ExxonMobil. Currently, this project makes up the majority of clean energy projects in our backlog since most electrolyzer investments are designated for the merchant market and therefore, considered base CapEx. There are a few projects like the recently announced Evonik agreement that meet backlog criteria.But even here, we support local network and supply high-purity clean hydrogen to electronics and other industrial customers as well. Currently, we view these electrolysis — electrolyzer projects as modules in our local supply network for supply of merchant hydrogen. They’re often integrated into our existing hydrogen network, sometimes side by side leveraging the same storage and transportation infrastructure, helping optimize distribution costs. Furthermore, these projects leverage various electrolyzer technologies, including PEM and outline to provide the best fit to customer needs. Sale of Plug is another avenue for Linde to participate in growth opportunities, which may have different customer demands or which may not benefit from integration with our existing supply network.With these details in mind let's take a look at some great natural resources stocks, out of which the notable names are Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).12 Best Natural Resources Stocks to BuyOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best natural resources stocks to buy based on hedge fund sentiment, we first narrowed down the top mining, forestry, and oil companies by market capitalization.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.38%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 9.78%.Coming into today, shares of the department store operator had gained 3.65% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 6.88%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.16%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Macy's as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Macy's to post earnings of $0.12 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 88%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.08 billion, down 9.34% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.94 per share and revenue of $22.97 billion, which would represent changes of -34.38% and -6.01%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Macy's. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 5% lower. Macy's currently has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).In terms of valuation, Macy's is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 5.61. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.55.Story continuesMeanwhile, M's PEG ratio is currently 0.47. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

To skip the detailed analysis of the natural gas industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now.Natural gas is one of the most used energy sources in the world. In the US alone, it accounted for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021, and in the electricity sector, it accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production.In 2022, fuel prices including natural gas peaked due to the Russia-Ukraine war which led to sanctions on Russia, resulting in pressure on European and global gas markets. However, due to favorable weather conditions and actions taken by the governments, the pressure on the market eased a little since the beginning of 2023. In Europe, natural gas consumption fell by almost 55 billion cubic meters year-over-year during the 2022/2023 heating season, marking the steepest decline in consumption for any recorded winter season. Furthermore, to avoid further pressures due to the cut-off from Russian exports, the European Union has also unveiled a 210 billion euro plan to completely be rid of Russian fossil fuel dependence by 2027. Compared to 2022, the Russian pipeline gas consumption is expected to drop around 45% in 2023. Nevertheless, In Asia and the Middle East, the natural gas demand is expected to increase by 3% and 2%, respectively, The higher demand from these regions will offset most of the drop in demand from Europe and the US in 2023 which is expected to decline by 5% and 2%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2023, the natural gas average price at Henry Hub was $2.55 per Metric Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), which showed an almost 40% YoY decline and a 57% sequential decline. The natural gas price was $4.55 per MMBtu in Q1 2022 and $5.92 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2022. Between mid-December and the first quarter of 2023, natural gas prices dropped by around 70% in Northeast Asian, North American, and European markets.Story continuesThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its short-term energy outlook on June 6 which reveals that the US natural gas production set a monthly record in April with 104 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) production. In the previous month, it was 102 billion cubic feet per day. The EIA expects natural gas production to average around 103 Bcfd in the second half of 2023. According to the EIA’s outlook, natural gas prices are expected to remain conservative in the second half of the year too with an estimated $2.60 per MMBtu average price in the third quarter of 2023. One of the main reasons for these low prices is overstocked inventory. In May, natural gas storage inventories were 15% above the 5-year average.Despite having a rough time, natural gas prices can still increase over time as it has been a key source of fuel in reducing global carbon emissions. On top of that, if a dry or hotter-than-usual summer comes along and gets followed by a cold winter, the commodity can experience high price volatility. On June 26, natural gas futures to their peak in two months and have since dropped by 6.8% on June 30.Even though natural gas prices are under pressure due to several factors, the commodity is still expected to play a huge role in the energy industry until renewable energy completely takes over fossil fuels. Due to low prices, natural gas stocks are also experiencing a decline in their stock prices. To take advantage of the situation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best stocks to look out for.10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Nowvovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we chose the natural gas companies according to their hedge fund sentiment as of the first quarter of 2022.

It is often considered an important parameter for gauging a company's potential to make profits.Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors' radar, regardless of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to offer impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated to its price performance.However, at times, it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:These efficiency ratios are:Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the ""accounts receivable turnover ratio"" or ""debtor's turnover ratio"" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.Story continuesOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Here are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:GMS is a distributor of wallboard and suspended ceilings.

Electrification will drive accelerating growth as next tier of regulations arrives in 2027.Forecast update: Region total demand stronger than expected for '23The US economy appears to have skirted the short recession in 2023, thanks to stoic consumer spending in durable and nominal goods, coupled with the resurgence in services, travel, and restaurants – which have buoyed freight and truck activity though still being constrained by supply chain issues after the COVID-19 pandemic. A slowing-down is expected to be visible by the fourth quarter, turning into a soft-growth 2024.After a strong first half of 2023, there should be a moderate reduction in medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle and bus demand through 2024, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility's Q2 2023 forecast update. However, the updated forecast maintains a more positive outlook for 2025 to 2026, when the truck market gears up for the next level of emissions regulations. The third tier of the 2027 greenhouse regulations, combined with the timing of the fleet replacement cycle, will likely fuel a strong wave of pre-emptive buying.""The added cost of those tougher regulations will drive more purchase activity in the middle of the decade,"" said Antti Lindstrom, principal analyst for commercial vehicle forecasting at S&amp;P Global Mobility. Furthermore, in the bus space, support measures from the public sector are driving the conversion of school buses and transit buses to zero-emission solutions, adding to this optimistic outlook.As momentum slows, demand is estimated to dip to a low of around 505,000 units in 2024 (including buses and motorhomes), with projections indicating approximately 543,000 units by 2025. While not the primary driver, the energy transition in the trucking sector starting in California – plus about a dozen other CARB states with similar trajectories – is poised to support volume growth in 2023 and after. In addition to expected new-product updates, both established players and startup OEMs are continuing to introduce ""cleaner"" versions of their existing truck models such as the Freightliner eCascadia and Hino's XL8 series, not to mention PACCAR's Kenworth and Peterbilt BEV models that comply with zero-emissions standards.Story continuesThere are several variations in observable market trends across different vehicle classes:Class 4 trucks, which were popular until the beginning of 2022, have been increasingly taken as lighter-duty applications for last-mile distribution during the pandemic. Ford's Class 4 Econoline Cutaway model accounts for nearly two-thirds of models in this segment and may see increased competition rising from the start-ups entering the fray.Class 5 vehicles, while facing supply chain issues, are expected to see an increase in demand following a post-pandemic pause - for example in public-sector buying.Class 6 trucks have gained attention due to their fuel efficiency and suitability for many commercial purposes. However, softening of the housing and construction market triggered a dip in Class 6 truck registrations.Class 7 trucks have been on a decline in popularity due to their licensing requirements and higher costs vs. Class 6, in addition to the recent preference of OEMs and customers for trucks that bracket this segment.After a stronger 2022 where OEMs continued to focus on Class 8 trucks amid supply chain bottlenecks, we expect tractor-truck registrations to remain flat this year before a dip in 2024, and a modest upward trajectory picks up again starting in 2025.Not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels, bus and motor home demand is projected to climb significantly in the current year and remaining at a similar level in 2024, supported by a rebound in school bus purchases. Growth is to resume in 2025, with motor homes and other bus types expected to provide the additional lift then.Regardless of weight class, the more stringent environmental compliance will be the key driver in demand and production of all vehicle types. Upcoming regulations, specifically the proposed greenhouse gas emissions standards by the Environmental Protection Agency are forcing traditional OEMs to re-evaluate their manufacturing and investment strategies and prompting a potentially rapid shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) products to electrified vehicles.These laws, in conjunction with the continued push for more aggressive decarbonization efforts by states like California with its Advanced Clean Fleet regulation, are acting as the key catalyst in the transformation of powertrain technologies. However, the transition to the adoption of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies remains limited by cost, infrastructure, and availability issues. This suggests battery-powered electrification as the go-to strategy will be pushed further into the midterm until those issues can be resolved – notwithstanding the recharging network for BEV trucks, which remains to be built.Disruptor brands like Tesla and Nikola will accelerate this transition for their part and help strengthen the US as the region's epicenter of production. As for the legacy brands, despite supply chain and labor issues, their Class 4-8 production rates for the North America region reached and even slightly exceeded the average build rates of 2019 by the end of 2022. While some production targets are still not being achieved, inventories continue being rebuilt – setting the stage for potential growth later.""Inventory figures of Class 4-7 trucks - which represent about half the market - remain below long-term averages, which is one reason why we think production has some upward potential,"" said Andrej Divis, executive director of global truck research at S&amp;P Global Mobility.Overall, present demand is still strong, owing to the muted risk of recession compared to the previous two quarters, combined with surprisingly resilient consumer activity. Production is expected to sustain its surge in the short term, while remaining constrained by supply chain and labor issues, before levelling off and even declining in 2024.About S&amp;P Global Mobility At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

It may not have been easy to hold on to SPGI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?S&amp;P Global's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at S&amp;P Global's main business drivers. Incorporated in December 1925, S&amp;P Global Inc. is a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.The company operates through six reportable segments: S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&amp;P Global Ratings (“Ratings""), S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&amp;P Global Mobility (“Mobility”), S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices”) and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions (“Engineering Solutions”).Ratings (27% of total revenues in 2022): Ratings operates as an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, providing investors and other market participants with information, ratings and benchmarks. With offices in more than 25 countries globally, Ratings holds an important position in the world's financial infrastructure. Ratings’ revenues are differentiated between transaction and non-transaction revenues.Market Intelligence (34%): It helps investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities to track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform evaluations and assess credit risk. Desktop, Data Management Solutions and Risk Services are the business lines included in the segment.Commodity Insights (15%): Commodity Insights provides information and benchmark prices for commodity and energy markets. It helps producers, traders, energy and commodity market intermediaries with price data, analytics and industry insights, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency in the market.Indices (12%): Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. Indices mainly derives revenues from asset-linked fees based on the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indices and also from subscription and transaction revenues.Mobility (10%) &amp; Engineering Solutions (3%) which were acquired as a result of the IHS Markit buyout, serves two different sections of customers. Mobility serves vehicle manufacturers, automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies while Engineering Solutions serves technical professionalsStory continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in S&amp;P Global ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $7,282.67, or a 628.27% gain, as of July 6, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 172.50% and the price of gold increased 47.29% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for SPGI.S&amp;P Global remains well poised to gain from growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products. Effective management execution has helped it generate solid cash flow which is utilized for growth initiatives. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors confidence and positively impact earnings per share. Partly due to these positives, the stock has gained in the past year. However, S&amp;P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries with respect to the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines. Growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses. Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.Shares have gained 6.79% over the past four weeks and there have been 2 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

119,d20b018a-e333-3270-b83e-00d6a8eb1e76,TSN,2023-07-07,3 ESG Stocks in Focus for the Socially Responsible Investor,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-esg-stocks-focus-socially-115300440.html,1688644380,STORY,"['CRM', 'MSFT', 'POOL', 'TSN']","[Astute investors largely concentrate on the earnings and balance sheets of a company before investing in them. However, their focus is now changing toward more sensitive issues like carbon emissions, deforestation and overall climate change.They are willing to associate with firms that are more eco-friendly and adhere to transparent governance, better known as environmental, social, governance (ESG) stocks. After all, companies with high profit margins but low ESG scores are at the moment losing eminence.Thus, investors should keep a tab on Pool Corporation POOL, Salesforce, Inc. CRM and Microsoft Corp MSFT, which deeply care about sustainability initiatives.What Are ESG Stocks?Several companies have now become mindful of the environment, social bias, and governance issues. At the same time, they have sharpened their focus on acting justly when it comes to employees’ needs and minimalizing the impact on biodiversity.These companies are transparent about their leadership, enforce business ethics, and cater to shareholders’ concerns. Most importantly, their goal is to improve the bottom line but with the least impact on the environment.Should You Have ESG Stocks in Your Portfolio?Investors, nowadays, want to do good with their money. They are willing to curtail their investment in companies that do immoral business, including vice stocks and companies that harm the environment. Thus, ESG stocks give them the option to place their bets in a business that is related to their ethical principles.Climate-related qualms, in recent times, have grown exponentially, which have further led to an increase in demand for companies involved in sustainable, or green business. Moreover, being engaged in sustainable business, ESG stocks are well-poised to gain traction soon when green energy becomes indispensable.ESG stocks, by the way, help reduce portfolio risk. For instance, PG&amp;E PCG had to declare bankruptcy in 2019 after wildfires lead to climate changes in California. If they had taken steps to curb carbon emissions, they wouldn’t have faced such a negative outcome.Story continuesSimilarly, Tyson Foods TSN was sued in 2020 when workers died after contracting the coronavirus. Several workers were compelled to work despite having COVID-19 symptoms. Needless to say, such an incident impacted the company’s profitability. Had they taken steps to improve the workplace policies, their profit margin wouldn’t have taken a beating.   Also, companies that focus on ESG tend to have strong leadership, which leads to better decision-making. This, in turn, helps the company stay afloat amid market upheavals.Do ESG Stocks Tend to Outperform?At present, there is no clarity on whether ESG stocks outdo the border market. ESG investing is comparatively a new concept, so there is little evidence historically that these stocks have better returns compared to other companies.However, as consumers are becoming socially conscious, ESG stocks no doubt have an edge. Their focus on top-line growth, cost reductions, product upliftment, asset optimization and easing regulatory pressure should certainly drive its shares northward time and again.3 ESG Stocks to Keep an Eye OnGiven the aforesaid benefits, investors should have a look at Pool Corporation. This company is one of the biggest distributors of swimming pool equipment. Pool Corporation aims at waste reduction and provides effective energy solutions to lessen its environmental footprint.Pool Corporation not only donates through the National Forest Foundation but also participates in the EPA’s Water Sense program. POOL provides customers ample guidance to handle wastewater sensibly.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for POOL’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.1% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 5.9%. Its shares have already gained 32.7% over the past five-year period. Pool Corporation has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Another company that should be on investors’ radar is Salesforce. The company is one of the primary providers of CRM software that helps manage cumbersome operations.Salesforce achieved 100% renewable energy from its operations. The company aims at purchasing renewable energy to increase access to clean power, especially in emerging economies. It also aims at net-zero carbon emissions and has established equal pay initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRM’s current-year earnings has moved up 4.6% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 42%. Its shares have already gained 28.1% over the past five-year period. Salesforce sports a Zacks Rank #1.Lastly, Microsoft has become a solid ESG stock. This tech behemoth and one of the leaders in cloud computing is also known as a leader in energy conservation. Microsoft, along with Volt Energy, is aiming at achieving 100% renewable energy by 2025. And by 2050, the company aims at getting rid of all carbon emissions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.3% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.7%. MSFT shares have already gained 22.3% over the past five-year period. Microsoft currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of Pool Corporation, Salesforce and Microsoft, by the way, have gained 22.8%, 61.3%, and 41%, respectively, so far this year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A copy of the same can be downloaded here.

The majority of the letter is focused on specific Fintech and financial issues. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.Manole Capital Management highlighted stocks like Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) is a consumer financial services company. On July 6, 2023, Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) stock closed at $33.44 per share. One-month return of Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) was -0.74%, and its shares gained 12.67% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) has a market capitalization of $14.331 billion.Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Others are trying to enter the digital wallet market, but we believe “the ship has already sailed.” Banks are trying to make a “last ditch effort” to be their consumers super app, instead of getting relegated and considered simple utilities. That same bank consortium (EWS) is trying to develop its own digital wallet.In addition to these big banks, Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) is mulling creating its own digital wallet for its 70 million private label cards. We hate to say that something has “no shot”, but this isn’t a product we expect to succeed. This just seems like a legacy provider of plastic cards trying to be relevant in an increasingly digital world. In our opinion, the best these issuers can hope for is getting the top spot in an existing digital wallet. By getting that “preferred card” spot, an issuer can garner the most usage on a smartphone.In its annual report, Synchrony stated that “in the future, we expect our products may face increased competitive pressure to the extent that our products are not, or do not continue to be, accepted in, or compatible with digital wallet technologies such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and other similar technologies.” As of today, Synchrony works with Apple, Samsung, and Google. However, it seems like Synchrony is formulating a plan for its own digital wallet because it worries that it may not be able to work through other existing platforms in the future.”Story continuesSynchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Organized criminals often disguise scammed funds through a series of ""mule"" accounts.To counter this, Mastercard has been working closely with UK banks for the past five years, tracking the flow of funds and closing down these accounts. By combining tracing insights with specific analysis factors such as account names, payment values, payer and payee history, and links to scam-associated accounts, Mastercard's AI solution enables banks to intervene proactively and prevent fraudulent payments.TSB's Success StoryTSB, one of the early adopters of Mastercard's Consumer Fraud Risk tool, has experienced remarkable success in detecting and preventing scams. In just four months, the bank has witnessed a significant increase in fraud detection. Based on TSB's results, if all banks were to adopt this technology, the UK could potentially save nearly £100 million annually. Encouraged by these outcomes, other banks are scheduled to adopt Consumer Fraud Risk throughout 2023. Mastercard is exploring opportunities to scale the solution in international markets.The Rise of Impersonation Scams and Mastercard's SolutionAs banking and payment security advances, fraudsters have shifted their focus to impersonation tactics, aiming to deceive individuals and businesses into making payments to fraudulent entities. This is known as authorized push payment fraud and accounted for 40% of UK bank fraud losses in 2022. A staggering $4.6 billion of losses are projected in the United States and the United Kingdom by 2026. Mastercard’s technology will help banks identify and predict payments to fraudsters, enabling real-time intervention and protection for customers.Story continuesMastercard's AI Revolutionizes Fraud PreventionFor over a decade, Mastercard has been at the forefront of AI integration, using the technology as a fundamental tool to identify patterns in fraud. Through its AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, Mastercard has prevented over $35 billion in fraud losses in the past three years alone. The introduction of Consumer Fraud Risk has proven to be a game changer. By combining AI insights with comprehensive customer behavior analysis, banks can develop targeted fraud strategies and combat different types of scams, such as purchase scams, impersonation scams and romance scams.With the help of partnerships with major UK banks and a commitment to expanding its solution globally, Mastercard is leading the charge in curbing cyber fraud.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceShares of Mastercard have gained 12.1% in a year compared with the industry’s 11.6% growth.MA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

From ways to generate income to how it can make work more efficient, the technology’s applications seem endless, even though it’s in its nascent stages.Jaspreet Singh on the 75/15/10 Rule: This Is How the 1% Manage Their WealthLearn: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchAnd now, AI can also decrease your cost of living in several ways. Here are a few of them.Be Your Personal Finance AssistantThere are numerous AI-powered apps that can help you create a budget, stick to it and save along the way. For example, WallyGPT is a free personal finance app that helps people worldwide track and manage their finances, as well as improve their financial literacy.Saeid Hejazi, founder at Wally, explained that once you’ve connected all of your bank accounts on the app, you can start talking to WallyGPT.The tool can help you get insights into your spending patterns, including benchmarking to people similar to you, and also get personalized recommendations for restaurants that fit your budget and tastes.How To Create a Budget Using ChatGPT: A Step-by-Step GuideIt can also research pros, cons and details of financial goals such as retirement planning, wedding planning or debt repayment; get personalized recommendations on credit cards and insurance products and services; and research investment strategies, choosing ETFs, risk levels, stocks and investing levels, Hejazi said.“If you asked ChatGPT how much is the cost for a 100-person, two-day wedding in Athens and how to save for it, you’ll only get answers for the first part of your question. Why? Because ChatGPT doesn’t know you or your financial situation,” Hajezi said. “It can’t take into consideration your income, savings, debts or spending patterns. The same applies to any financial decision people make on a daily basis.”Cut Food Waste and Save Money (and the Planet)Inflation has put a strain on Americans’ wallets, with the price of food forcing many to be very careful and cut down on groceries.Story continuesAt the same time, Americans toss out between $161 billion and $218 billion worth of food every year. What’s more, the average family of four wastes an eye-popping $1,500 of food annually, according to Earth.org.An aggravating factor of all of that food waste is that it contributes to 8% of all global emissions.Enter CutWaste, an AI-powered app that helps households reduce food waste at home and save money in the process. It provides expiry reminders for food in your pantry, and it creates custom shopping lists based on what is in the pantry, explained founder Prateeksha Uday.“It’s easy to use,” Uday said. “You take a picture of your grocery receipt, and the app uses AI to figure out everything being added to your pantry, as well as the expiry date for each item. You can find all your items organized by expiry date at any point and can meal prep more mindfully using up items expiring soon first.”Uday added that you also can mark food items as eaten or trashed once you’re through with them so you can track how much you’re saving monthly. For your grocery runs, the app also creates a custom shopping list based on your household consumption.Help With Homeownership CostsHomeownership is a dream for many, but it’s a dream that also entails a lot of responsibilities, organization, maintenance and money. And yes, there are AI-powered apps for that.For example, HomeZada, an AI-enabled digital platform, can help homeowners manage the costs of homeownership — including loans, taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance, repairs and remodels — to maximize the value of their single-largest asset, said John Bodrozic, co-founder of HomeZada.Bodrozic explained that HomeZada integrates all expenses associated with homeownership into an integrated budget tracker and schedule. The AI chat assistant can then send real-time suggestions for minimizing home costs — such as labor and product — and maximizing value. He said the assistant also can manage and track all remodel and home improvement projects and receive real-time contractor, designer, brand, product and cost-cutting recommendations, as well as organize all home-related documents into a completely paperless library.Help With Traveling CostsExpedia, KAYAK and a slew of other travel sites launched ChatGPT plug-ins recently so users can get recommendations on places to go, where to stay, how to get around and what to see and do based on the chat, according to a press release by Expedia Group.“A traveler can start a conversation directly on the ChatGPT site and select the Expedia plug-in to bring a trip to life,” the release stated. “When they’re ready to book, they go straight to Expedia.”As stated on KAYAK’s website, the ChatGPT plug-in “will act as a virtual travel assistant, allowing for more conversational interactions with KAYAK’s search engine. Users can head to ChatGPT and ask it questions in the same way they would ask a human.”Hopper is another one that uses AI to predict and analyze flights, hotel and rental car prices. According to the company, you can save an average of $65 per trip.More From GOBankingRatesSuze Orman's Top 26 Tips That Will Save You From Financial DisasterMoney Expert Jaspreet Singh Says You Can Use ChatGPT To Become a Millionaire -- Here's How3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement55 Easy Ways To Save Money DailyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How AI Can Decrease Your Cost of Living]"

The award has been offered by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT.Details of the DealValued at $57.4 million, the contract is projected to get completed by Dec 31, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide F-16 Peace Carpathian M6.6 Operational Flight Program and System upgrade.The contract will serve the Romania Air Force. The work related to this deal will be performed at Fort Worth, TX; Greenville, SC; and Romania.Importance of F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products.  Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio.It is imperative to mention here that F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years. The F-16 has witnessed significant development in the last couple of years, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.To make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previous F-16 version. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals.Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products, including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.72% during the 2023-2028 period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft. This segment's primary products include military aircraft like the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15, P-8, the KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk aircraft.BA has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales implies a 17.9% increase from the 2022 reported figure.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. The company also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. This helps warfighters accomplish missions anytime, anywhere and under any condition.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates a 4.7% increase from the previous year’s reported number.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include the Beechcraft T-6C trainer and the AT-6 Wolverine.TXT has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%.

130,e69dbc27-544f-34c9-9d43-a9192eb63dc1,LMT,2023-07-07,Can Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-corporation-nyse-lmt-140123027.html,1688652083,STORY,['LMT'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lockheed Martin is:59% = US$5.7b ÷ US$9.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.59 in profit.Does Lockheed Martin Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Lockheed Martin has a higher ROE than the average (12%) in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Lockheed Martin by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesLockheed Martin's Debt And Its 59% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Lockheed Martin, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.62. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +2.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has gained 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.62 per share, indicating a change of +1.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.01 indicates a change of +3.3% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $24.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $98.86 billion and $101.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.1% and +2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $24.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Medtronic is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.069 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$91b - US$9.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, Medtronic has an ROCE of 6.9%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.1%. View our latest analysis for Medtronic roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Medtronic compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Medtronic.What Does the ROCE Trend For Medtronic Tell Us?There hasn't been much to report for Medtronic's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Medtronic to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 51% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWe can conclude that in regards to Medtronic's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 10% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Like most companies, Medtronic does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.While Medtronic may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the rubber and plastics industry, head directly to 5 Best Rubber and Plastics Stocks To Buy. In 2022, the worldwide market demand for natural rubber was valued at $30.61 billion. Expert Market Research expects it to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5% during the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. By 2028, it is estimated that the market value for natural rubber will reach approximately $37.63 billion. The Asia Pacific region is the dominant leader in the natural rubber industry, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia being primary suppliers. Additionally, Vietnam is emerging as a notable sourcing location and has the potential to become a major rubber producer in the near future. The demand for natural rubber in the Asia Pacific is mainly driven by the growing automobile industry and the rising need for latex products such as condoms, belts, gloves, and more. Thailand is the leading supplier for the global natural rubber market, holding a 37% market share.The global rubber market experienced a significant decline in demand in 2022 due to ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. As 2023 progresses, experts expect that the rubber industry will witness notable recovery in terms of market performance. However, the abandonment of China's zero-Covid policy and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine are two major global phenomena that greatly influence the future demand for rubber worldwide. In line with market recovery, rubber and plastics companies are making big moves. For example, Pirelli, a multinational tire manufacturer from Italy, recently entered into an agreement to acquire 100% ownership of Hevea-Tec, the largest independent processor of natural rubber in Brazil. The deal, valued at approximately 21 million euros ($22.9 million), is expected to be finalized by the end of 2023, pending approval from antitrust authorities. This acquisition will enhance Pirelli's access to natural rubber in Latin America, ensuring a consistent supply in the region and increasing overall efficiency. Pirelli also stated that the purchase of Hevea-Tec will enable them to strengthen their control over the natural rubber supply chain, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions through local sourcing.Story continuesDon't Miss: 15 Largest Plastic Manufacturing Companies in the WorldSimilarly, in the beginning of June, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced that it is initiating a multi-billion dollar petrochemical facility in China. This is the oil and gas giant’s new growth strategy, despite the mounting US-China tensions. According to S&amp;P Global, this facility is the largest among several other new projects in China that are being developed by different companies to produce ethylene, which is a key component in the production of plastic. By means of this new facility in China, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) will gain a significant share in the top emerging market for petrochemicals. This market supplies the plastics, resins, and fibers that are utilized by China's manufacturing sector to produce common consumer goods found in households worldwide. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is highly motivated to move forward with its investment since it forecasts that the demand for petrochemicals will continue to grow significantly beyond the demand for oil, which is expected to remain comparatively stable until 2050. Petrochemicals such as ethylene and polypropylene, which serve as the base components for manufacturing plastic bottles, food packaging, and medical instruments, are more difficult to replace with low-carbon substitutes. Exxon expects a 42% global increase in chemical demand from 2017 to 2030, compared to a mere 5% increase in gasoline demand.Given these promising market developments, investors have the opportunity to cash in on the growth potential of the rubber and plastics industry by buying stocks like Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW), and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB).Our Methodology We selected the following rubber and plastics stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Rubber and Plastics Stocks to BuyCopyright: baranq / 123RF Stock PhotoBest Rubber and Plastics Stocks to Buy10.

Trinseo PLC (NYSE:TSE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12Trinseo PLC (NYSE:TSE) provides specialty material solutions worldwide. The company operates in six segments – Engineered Materials, Latex Binders, Base Plastics, Polystyrene, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. It is one of the best rubber and plastics stocks to invest in.

Silgan Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SLGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18Silgan Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SLGN) develops and sells rigid packaging solutions for consumer products in the United States and internationally. The company offers a range of metal and plastic closures, stock plastic containers, plastic thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls, and plastic closures for food, household, and personal care products. It is one of the best rubber and plastics stocks to watch. On May 2, Silgan Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SLGN) declared a $0.18 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous.

Amy Minella’s Cardinal Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.05 million shares worth $164 million.  Here is what Upslope Capital has to say about Silgan Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SLGN) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Silgan is a one-foot hurdle. The company grows modestly and consistently – largely through M&amp;A – and the stock is obviously cheap (12x EPS, 9% FCF yield) on an absolute and relative basis. Shares should perform well in a variety of the most likely environments and represent an opportunity to own a stock that is at once defensive/non-cyclical and cheap. The company has three segments: Metal Containers (food cans, which is what SLGN is most known for and proactively shifted away from in recent years; 40%+ of operating income), Dispensing &amp; Specialty Closures (plastic/metal caps and dispensing systems/sprayers; 40%+ of operating income), and Plastic Containers (15% of operating income). In 2020, SLGN acquired Albéa’s dispensing business (a key competitor of Aptar’s – one of Upslope’s long standing Core longs).While very much a traditional value stock (i.e. not exactly “quality”), I could foresee owning shares longer- term as SLGN has quietly positioned itself in recent years as a PE-style packaging platform that happens to be publicly traded. Management has historically been disciplined capital allocators, pivoting away from the slowly-melting-ice-cube that is food cans (now &lt; 50% of revenue)…” (Click here to see the full text)7. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) manufactures and distributes tires worldwide. It also designs and sells tread rubber and other tire retreading materials. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) is one of the best rubber stocks to invest in.

Elliott, with a 10% economic interest in the company, also expressed a desire for Goodyear to consider selling its company-owned store network or at least monetize it more efficiently. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 27 hedge funds were bullish on The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter.

We sold our position in Goodyear due to the cavalcade of concerns including the company’s elevated debt levels, inflationary pressures from higher input prices, continued manufacturing challenges in the auto industry and complications with the company’s manufacturing volume. With substantial exposure to the automotive industry through other portfolio holdings, we elected to consolidate our exposure within those higher-conviction holdings.”6.

Year to date, the S&amp;P Pharmaceuticals Select Industry index is down 1% while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index has gained 15%. After a strong run during the pandemic when Covid-19 vaccines started being developed, pharma stocks appear to now be taking a breather. With a few exceptions, most major pharmaceutical stocks are down by double digits this year.There are many reasons for the poor performances including the declining sales of Covid-19 treatments, some blockbuster medications losing their patent protections and a slowing economy that could fall into a recession. Whatever the reasons, the decline has led to many pharma stocks becoming undervalued, presenting an opportunity for investors. Here are the three most undervalued pharma stock to buy now in June 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIt might not be undervalued per se, but pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) stock has more runway ahead. Up 42% in the last 12 months, including a 27% gain this year, LLY stock looks a little pricey with a price-earnings (PE) ratio of 73. However, it might be worth paying a premium for the stock given its growth potential. Eli Lilly’s share price has a huge catalyst in the form of Mounjaro, a medication that treats Type 2 Diabetes and has also been found to cause dramatic weight loss, opening the door for it to be used to also treat obesity.Each study released concerning Mounjaro appears to be better than the previous one. Eli Lilly is waiting on approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin selling Mounjaro as a weight loss treatment, but it is already advertising the medication for Diabetes patients and it is going full force producing the drug in anticipation of getting a greenlight from the FDA later this year. Conservative estimates say that Mounjaro could generate sales of $25 billion for Eli Lilly. This makes LLY stock a buy.Story continuesAbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comA more obvious undervalued pharma stock is AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). The company behind the blockbuster drug Humira which is used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease has seen its stock decline 18% this year. The share price is currently trading 25% below its all-time high reached in April 2022. A price-to-earnings ratio of 31 makes the stock seem fairly valued, and shareholders benefit from a hearty dividend that yields 4.45% or $1.48 a share each quarter.The reason for the slide in ABBV stock is that the company lost patent exclusivity for Humira earlier this year, a situation that is expected to hurt sales and earnings moving forward. There have also been reports of executives at AbbVie selling their stock in the company, with Chief Commercial Officer Jeffrey Stewart selling $4.8 million worth of shares throughout the last 12 months. These events have pushed many investors to the sidelines. However, the decline in ABBV stock has created a buying opportunity for investors who want undervalued pharma stocks.Merck &amp; Co. (MRK)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPharma company Merck &amp; Co.’s (NYSE:MRK) stock looks ripe for the picking. Best known for the cancer treatment Keytruda and the HPV vaccine Gardasil, Merck &amp; Co’s stock is flat on the year (up 1%) and it has an attractive P/E ratio of 22, which is low for a company that has a market capitalization of nearly $300 billion. MRK stock also pays a healthy dividend that yields 2.58% or 73 cents a share per quarter. Over five years, MRK stock has nearly doubled, having gained 95% since June 2018.The reasons for this year’s lackluster performance is declining sales of the company’s Covid-19 antiviral pill called Lagevrio. Slowing sales of the Covid pill dragged Merck’s revenues down 9% to $14.5 billion in this year’s first quarter, which gave analysts and investors some pause. However, long-term, Merck &amp; Co. remains a leading global pharmaceutical company with annual sales of more than $40 billion. The company also has a healthy pipeline of new medications and several blockbuster drugs that remain under patent protection.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in LLY.

143,d79c2546-f473-3a44-9a81-077e6938540c,ROK,2023-07-07,12 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-robotics-stocks-buy-154518106.html,1688658318,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TSLA', 'PATH', 'TMO', 'ZBRA', 'AME', 'ROK', 'KITT', 'HLX', 'TER', 'AMBA']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best robotics stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our analysis of the robotics industry, how it is gradually affecting several walks of life, and want to skip ahead to the top five stocks on this list, then take a look at 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now. One trend that is slowly taking over the industrial world and making slow inroads into consumer use as well, is the growing use of robotics. Their utility, particularly in heavy duty industrial manufacturing and tasks that are often hazardous to humans has created new opportunities for growth and cost efficiencies.In fact, as the world was reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the use of robotics in industries actually grew. Data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) shows that when it came to the food and beverages industry, the use of robotics grew by 25% in 2021 to sit at 3,402 units as they provided a handy way of continuing business and adhering to social distancing requirements at the same time. And while the use of robots in the food industry was in the thousands, as a whole, more than half a million robots are deployed across various industries such as chemicals, automobile manufacturing, and plastic production. These sectors often carry hazards to human health, as they require handling dangerous materials, heavy equipment, or conducting repetitive tasks.The growth in the use of robotics is part of a growing trend toward automation that provides firms with an opportunity to streamline their operations and reduce worker costs. According to McKinsey, automation can boost global productivity by as much as 1.4% each year and it could even cut paid positions in half. The nature of its products, which are heavy machines that require significant manual labor otherwise, has also led to the automotive industry being one of the biggest users of robotics by accounting for 29% of global automation demand as of 2022.Story continuesBuilding on this, the global robotics industry was worth $27 billion in 2020 and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.45% to be worth $74 billion by 2027. As should be expected, automotive production and industrialization will play a key role in this market. Some of the top industrial robotics companies in the world are Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), ABB Ltd (OTCMKTS:ABBNY), and DENSO Corporation (OTCMKTS:DNZOY), and for more details on this highly lucrative robotics niche, you can check out Top 10 Industrial Robotics Companies in the World.Taking a deeper look at what some of these firms are doing, ABB Ltd (OTCMKTS:ABBNY), one of the most proactive robotics firms in the world, is right at the top of its game as it has already started to consider how to bring artificial intelligence to industrial robotics. The firm has partnered up with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to integrate AI into industrial processes for reducing machine downtime and increasing equipment lifespans. It will also allow decision makers to consolidate operational data with their decision making processes to provide better insights.Another highly consequential robotics firm, particularly when it comes to healthcare use is Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). Its robots, as the name suggests, aid surgeons conduct some of the most difficult tasks in the world. And on this front, Intuitive scored a big win earlier this year when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its da Vinci surgical system for use in simple prostate surgery where doctors remove portions of an enlarged prostate to ensure smooth urinal flow. The system was also approved for a prostate surgery procedure where the entire gland is removed, often for patients that have prostate cancer. And while these are established companies with a large operations base, newer and younger companies are also entering the industry.One such firm is Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (NASDAQ:KITT) which went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021 in a $150 million initial public offering. The IPO was one of many during a time when SPACs were quite popular with retail investors, who flocked to them in droves due to the potential for share price appreciation. Nauticus is an interesting robotics firm, with a business model that is called robotics as a service (RaaS). This allows firms to use robots on a subscription basis, enabling them to save up on capital expenditures and utilize cost savings and efficiencies at the same time. However, the very expectation of a high return through an IPO also led to the shares of Nauticus' SPAC firm Cleantech tanking by 35% when shareholders approved the IPO since it also disclosed that roughly 1.4 million shares would be available for trading while retail investors had believed the float would be lower.As to what's happening in the robotics industry right now, here's what the management of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) had to say during the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings conference:One of our large multiyear wins in eCommerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell’s smart machine architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale. Another important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic’s disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications. Moving to our Hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top robotics stocks, out of which the notable names are Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG).12 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the best robotics stocks, we first made a list of all robotics companies operating in industrial, healthcare, software (yes there are software robots, as part of robotic process automation systems), and other domains.

Southern Company subsidiaries also actively engage with many of these emerging companies in a mutual quest for new ways to improve their business processes.One such company is Urbint. Urbint uses artificial intelligence in combination with real-world data to predict threats to workers, communities, critical infrastructure and the environment, and to help stop accidents before they happen. Such predictive solutions are potentially game-changing in Southern Company's pursuit of its core value of Safety First.Urbint technology has been successfully applied to identify the risk of leaks or third-party damages to underground utilities. Urbint worked with Southern Company Gas to develop the damage prevention solution which was first deployed at Nicor Gas and eventually expanded throughout the enterprise.More recently, Urbint has developed solutions for enhanced worker safety, identifying safety hazards and threats in advance in order to prevent incidents that can result in life-altering injuries or even fatalities.Georgia Power is currently engaged with Urbint for a Worker Safety pilot at two distribution centers. Urbint is developing a ""smart"" electronic job safety briefing (JSB) with hazard analysis that will be deployed on field crews' iPads.Using information about incidents and ""near misses"" gleaned from Georgia Power, Urbint's risk engine will harmonize facts about work site conditions and project data with Urbint's task and hazard library to identify specific risks, the hazard potential for each job task, and recommend preventive measures. And, as more users embrace the Urbint solution, data gleaned from the experience of others across the nation will provide even greater insights for safety precautions.Story continues""We are excited about this partnership with Urbint,"" said Michael Middleton, director of safety and health for Georgia Power. ""As we combine our actively-caring safety culture with new technology, data, analytics and artificial intelligence, this partnership has the potential to lead us to a safer tomorrow.""""Ultimately, our IBEW partners are the end users of this technology,"" added Middleton. ""They've been engaged from the beginning to provide real-time feedback to our leadership team and to Urbint. They know the work and understand the hazards. Their influence will help us create a robust electronic job safety briefing that should ultimately help prevent injuries.""""We've designed a job safety brief that will provide an interactive and engaging experience for the worker. If that doesn't happen, the JSB won't optimize for safety and will never achieve full adoption in the field,"" explained Urbint CEO Corey Capasso. ""By leveraging Urbint to integrate safety science into an engaging tailboard meeting, Georgia Power is making it easier for their teams to identify hazards and implement appropriate controls which can ultimately prevent injuries and even save lives.""The Worker Safety pilot is ongoing for the duration of 2023.Southern Company, Thursday, July 6, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Southern Company on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Southern CompanyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/southern-companyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Southern CompanyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/766027/Southern-Company-Subsidiaries-Among-the-First-To-Use-AI-To-Enhance-Worker-Safety]"

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.7%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. However, TE Connectivity's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 29.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 29%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.84 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.36. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that TE Connectivity has grown earnings per share at 15% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that TE Connectivity is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

(Photo Credit: NASA)Sustaining the World’s Most Powerful Space TelescopeWebb’s mid-infrared image of barred spiral galaxy NGC 5068, located around 17 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. (Photo Credit: NASA)WASHINGTON, July 06, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) nears its one-year anniversary of providing incredible imagery showcasing the origins of our universe, pioneering and sustaining a new era in astronomy is no small task.Engineers at Northrop Grumman – in partnership with NASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) – perform maintenance support for Webb using testbeds that simulate the observatory on the ground. These testbeds are used to develop and test products (such as flight software updates) that will be used on the observatory or to help investigate different behaviors. This ensures the observatory continues to operate optimally throughout its lifespan.“Today, the team is powering Webb’s discoveries and expanding humankind’s understanding of the universe, by keeping the observatory safe and healthy,” said Robby Swoish, program manager, James Webb Space Telescope operations and maintenance, Northrop Grumman. “Our top priority is Webb’s continued mission success as it scans the cosmos with optimal precision.”Looking at TrendsNorthrop Grumman’s engineers who developed and designed the groundbreaking observatory assist with the analysis of engineering data received from Webb. Using their historical knowledge of the observatory and engineering expertise, the Northrop Grumman team looks at trends in the observatory performance (such as tank pressures and temperatures) to make sure the observatory is performing as expected. When trends are aligned with anticipated behavior or forecasting models, the observatory can stay focused on its science mission.Story continuesMaintaining Flight SoftwareThe Northrop Grumman team is responsible for developing updates to Webb’s flight software – just like software updates made to smartphones. Spacecraft flight software helps control functions like the spacecraft’s orientation and maintains operational temperatures.Recently, the team made an update to the observatory’s spacecraft software that will help streamline a command sequence onboard previously performed from the ground. This new optimization reduces ground intervention and maximizes efficiency so Webb can spend more time observing the cosmos.Replicating the Observatory on EarthBefore any updates are made to Webb in space, Northrop Grumman practices on Earth.On Earth, Northrop Grumman performs maintenance and operates the Engineering Model Testbed (EMTB) that replicates a majority of Webb’s spacecraft hardware. Engineers can test a variety of flight products, such as flight software updates and operating procedures. By testing these updates and procedures, engineers can confirm that they work as expected before using them on the observatory.Continuing the MissionSince launching on December 25, 2021, Webb has performed above and beyond expectations. The Webb team determined the observatory should have enough propellant to allow support of science operations on orbit for more than a 20-year science lifetime, giving humanity an unprecedented view of the cosmos. Extending the telescope’s life will only continue more operations from the team to reveal answers to unprecedented questions.“The discoveries astronomers and scientists have made so far with Webb are raising newer and bigger questions about the universe,” said Jon Arenberg, chief mission architect, Northrop Grumman. “With new questions – come new ideas and Webb will inform the next generation of advanced science missions.”Contact:Nestor Vences Gonzalez 424-352-6721 (mobile) nestor.vencesgonzalez@ngc.comA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9166a4c5-264e-430a-9df5-c64a2c5d7425]"

What better way to show off how cool your aging 40-year-old-plus self is in the office than by rocking a pair of sweet Nike dunks a day after the manufacturer served up lackluster guidance and the stock sank?Interestingly, the Foot Locker store where I got these pricey fountains of youth was generally empty. The July Fourth weekend is usually a hotbed of buying activity for things you don't really need but rather want. And maybe it was in other states, just not at this particular store at this particular moment in time.morning brief imageWhat wasn't empty on July Fourth weekend? The two no-frills Marshalls locations (owned and operated by TJX Companies) I popped into for some silverware — one on Saturday and the other on Sunday. Both stores looked as if angry bulls had run amok in the aisles — everything was that messy and picked over. Cut in line at your own risk, the places were mobbed with deal seekers.These three holiday occurrences sent me back to reconnect on the state of consumer stocks ahead of the pivotal back-to-school shopping season.I was reminded how hated consumer names are right now, as seen in new Bank of America data.Consumer discretionary stocks are at the lowest exposure among hedge fund managers and long-only managers in the history of Bank of America's data set.""Resilient consumption in the face of inflation pressures, a slackening labor market, and a host of other factors is seen as unsustainable by most portfolio managers,"" said BofA's top equity strategist Savita Subramanian.Story continuesSubramanian added, ""faith in the consumer is waning.""Ouch.The top 20 most-shorted S&amp;P 500 stocks — as presented by BofA — are dominated by companies deemed consumer discretionary.The top five includes Dish Network (you definitely don't need expensive Dish Network services); Ralph Lauren (don't need an $80 polo shirt from Macy's); CarMax (you can live with your 100,000-mile road warrior a little longer in a land of higher financing costs); Paramount (do you really need Paramount+?); CH Robinson (a logistics play that ships stuff you probably don't need).This positioning reeks of investors banking on a second-half consumer collapse.But perhaps all of this negativity on the consumer shouldn't come as a surprise.The jobs market is slowing. Stories about AI taking jobs continue to populate (here's what musician and tech investor will.i.am told us recently on the topic). Headline-grabbing layoffs continue to rip through the economy (see Disney's ESPN ""talent"" cuts).Further, nagging inflation has eaten into the trillions of dollars in pandemic savings.The personal savings rate sits at 4.6%, down from double-digits at the height of the pandemic and below the long-run average of 8.3%.Can't spend much if your paycheck is barely making ends meet and your savings account is as dried up as the Sahara.Should you be using this juncture to go against the crowd and scoop up retailers and other consumer-centric stocks? Beats me. I just buy Nike dunks and do news — I don't pick stocks anymore.I will say this though: It's hard to get too excited about many of these names in front of potentially two more interest rate hikes, a down-trending personal savings rate, and sticky inflation.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Michele Schneider, Marketgauge.com Chief Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss big banks setting the tone for earnings, as well as what to expect from AI stocks, consumer-facing companies, airlines, oil, and gas.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]DIANE KING HALL: A new earnings season just around the corner. And as usual, big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup will kick off the busy quarter next week.But Wall Street's biggest banks might be facing tighter profit margins following the aftermath of the banking crisis and collapse of Silicon Valley Bank back in March.Now some analysts are painting a gloomy picture for this quarter, saying Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. Michele Schneider, MarketGauge.com Chief Strategist is still here with us. So Michele, do you agree with that assessment?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, if we look at what had boosted the bank earnings in the past, a lot of it was from their financial side, right? From people-- from people being involved in investments and that liquidity that it added to banks.And also being able to borrow money, which right now is much more difficult that these higher interest rates. And even though the housing market has been strong, obviously mortgage applications have been impacted by rising rates.So yeah, at this point, I would think that for this quarter, we will not necessarily see very strong bank earnings. And you mentioned the banking crisis. I mean, some people feel that it was just a little bit too soon in terms of saying crisis over. I mean, what did it last? Like about four days.And so the higher the interest rates go, that could put a lot of squeeze particularly on the commercial real estate and the regional bank side. So I would not have great high expectations at this point.BRAD SMITH: Do you think there's a theme that emerges this earnings season? It seemed like last earnings season, it was all about how can we say AI in various amount of ways for companies who had no business saying it in some of them. So Michele, is there one theme that you believe will emerge this earnings season?Story continuesMICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, again, I think that you have-- the advantage is going to be to any of these companies that have managed to survive throughout the first six months because of their operating cash flow. And that has given them some level of growth.And that's why you have to mention AI, right? Because that certainly has happened there. So that's kind of what I would continue to look at. I mean, just take Nike in terms of the consumer space, right? Earnings not great and Nike stock has been falling.So if that's any kind of foreshadowing, that means that we will see a lot of stress in terms of the earnings. And it's going to be, of course, what they say about future as we get through the rest of the year.And at this point, right now, with the expectations of two more interest rate hikes and as we've talked about already, inflation not necessarily being in control, at least in the places that affect consumers the worst, yeah, I would think that we'll see AI probably still do well.Apple, all these companies as they continue to compete with one another. But a lot of the other companies not necessarily doing so great.DIANE KING HALL: So can you name more of those companies, besides Nike, that where you expect to see some stress. Would these be consumer company-- consumer-facing companies or where are you expecting to see this stress?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, we started with banks so I think the banks can set the tone for sure. And if they do not come in great or worse than expected, right?I mean, the thing with earnings seasons, first of all, is that it's always looking backwards and it's really about what the actual number is versus the expectation that has the greatest impact to the market. And even that is, sometimes, a short-term impact. So the longer term impact generally is what they project going forward, the guidance.And so, yeah, I mean-- I mean, like, let's take some of the high flyers in terms of the consumer space that we've seen in the past, Lululemon being one. I think that those kind of companies could actually start to feel the strain.Whereas some of the fast food companies that had had stress could actually start to come back a little bit. You know, like a McDonald's, for example.So I think that that's really-- you have to think what's going to be if everything we've just talked about, Diane, turns out to be true. If the market has seen a top. If the yields are going to have to be stretched. If we are going to enter more stagflation, potentially recession as we get into 2024.Where are these company-- where are people are going to spend their money? And they're going to spend the money on more of the staples, which did terribly, right? I mean Target, of course, had its own reasons for doing that outside of being Staples, which went down against discretionary. But that could rebound.A company like Walmart could continue to do well. You know, where people are going to go and buy cheapest goods they can get at this point.BRAD SMITH: Michele, just lastly while we're on this topic. One of my favorite conversations to kick off the earnings season is with Delta's executives.Because it gives us a sense of where this counter-cyclical recovery that we've heard about from travel companies is continuing or what type of consumer profile they're continuing to engage with.Particularly across services spending right now in the experience economy, are you expecting for there to be any slowdown within that?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, it's such a good question, Brad, because we actually were in the cruise line stocks and had taken some profits along the way.And I've talked to people who do go on a lot of cruises. They said they're booked out for at least the next year. And so again, at this point, that still could be an outperforming area as people seem to be cutting back in certain things but yet wanting to get out, wanting to get away, wanting to go on a cruise, wanting to get on a plane.Do I think that can be impacted? Of course. As we know, when things get sour, if they go sour, it's really hard for anything, particularly in this more sort of discretionary area, to sustain.And then we have this other kind of crazy thing going on which is the possibility of labor unrest as wages continue to have to increase to keep up. And you know, you had a strike right now in UPS and I think it's still out there. And there's been threats of airline strikes.So I think I wouldn't necessarily be all that overly optimistic anywhere when it comes to the equity space, even in the airlines and the cruise lines.DIANE KING HALL: Interesting.

The dividend increase is, however, subject to approval from BAC’s board of directors.Prior to this hike, the company announced a dividend increase of 4.8% in July 2022, following a 17% hike in July 2021. Moreover, in October 2021, BAC’s share repurchase plan of $25 billion was renewed (replacing the April 2021 authorization).Despite passing the 2023 stress test, BAC delayed announcing its dividend because there was a significant difference between how the Federal Reserve and the company’s own risk management predicted BofA to fare in case of a severe recession.BofA estimated that it would lose $52 billion in case of a severe economic downturn and that its capital ratio would decline to a minimum of 8.3% per cent. However, per the Fed’s stress test results, BofA would lose only $23 billion in a severe economic downturn and its capital ratio would fall to 10.6%.Thus, BofA initiated a dialogue with the Fed to understand the difference between the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review results, and BAC’s Dodd-Frank Act stress test results.While announcing plans for the dividend increase, Bank of America said that the discussions with the Fed are ongoing.Over the past six months, shares of BAC have lost 14.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 7.2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, BAC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, the results of this year’s annual health check indicate that banks have sufficient capital to withstand a severe economic downturn.The stress test has solidified the notion that large banks are resilient. Results have shown that the 23 participating banks have enough capital to absorb the $541 billion in projected losses on loans and other positions.Going into the stress test, analysts were forecasting conservative payouts from banks on the back of potential stringent regulatory capital requirements and ambiguity over the macroeconomic backdrop, including probable recession next year.However, the impressive results have opened the doors for bigger-than-expected payouts.Thus, most of the large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan JPM and Wells Fargo WFC, said that they would return more cash to shareholders.JPM, the largest U.S. bank, intends to raise the quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share. This follows no change in dividend payout last year.The company’s chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, said, “We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet with strong capital levels and robust liquidity, and we remain prepared for a broad range of potential outcomes, including potentially higher future capital requirements from the finalization of the Basel III capital rules.”JPM also plans to continue with its previously announced share repurchase program.Likewise, Wells Fargo announced plans to hike its dividend to 35 cents per share from the current 30 cents. Also, over the four-quarter period through the second quarter of 2024, WFC has the capacity to repurchase shares.Story continuesConclusionThe stress test results and the subsequent increases in payouts by banks show that the industry is well-prepared to confront any challenges.Yet, banks continue to brace for higher capital requirements from the regulators. This is a major near-term headwind and seems to have held back regional banks from coming up with new capital plans.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Michele Schneider, Marketgauge.com Chief Strategist, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss big banks setting the tone for earnings, as well as what to expect from AI stocks, consumer-facing companies, airlines, oil, and gas.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]DIANE KING HALL: A new earnings season just around the corner. And as usual, big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup will kick off the busy quarter next week.But Wall Street's biggest banks might be facing tighter profit margins following the aftermath of the banking crisis and collapse of Silicon Valley Bank back in March.Now some analysts are painting a gloomy picture for this quarter, saying Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. Michele Schneider, MarketGauge.com Chief Strategist is still here with us. So Michele, do you agree with that assessment?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, if we look at what had boosted the bank earnings in the past, a lot of it was from their financial side, right? From people-- from people being involved in investments and that liquidity that it added to banks.And also being able to borrow money, which right now is much more difficult that these higher interest rates. And even though the housing market has been strong, obviously mortgage applications have been impacted by rising rates.So yeah, at this point, I would think that for this quarter, we will not necessarily see very strong bank earnings. And you mentioned the banking crisis. I mean, some people feel that it was just a little bit too soon in terms of saying crisis over. I mean, what did it last? Like about four days.And so the higher the interest rates go, that could put a lot of squeeze particularly on the commercial real estate and the regional bank side. So I would not have great high expectations at this point.BRAD SMITH: Do you think there's a theme that emerges this earnings season? It seemed like last earnings season, it was all about how can we say AI in various amount of ways for companies who had no business saying it in some of them. So Michele, is there one theme that you believe will emerge this earnings season?Story continuesMICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, again, I think that you have-- the advantage is going to be to any of these companies that have managed to survive throughout the first six months because of their operating cash flow. And that has given them some level of growth.And that's why you have to mention AI, right? Because that certainly has happened there. So that's kind of what I would continue to look at. I mean, just take Nike in terms of the consumer space, right? Earnings not great and Nike stock has been falling.So if that's any kind of foreshadowing, that means that we will see a lot of stress in terms of the earnings. And it's going to be, of course, what they say about future as we get through the rest of the year.And at this point, right now, with the expectations of two more interest rate hikes and as we've talked about already, inflation not necessarily being in control, at least in the places that affect consumers the worst, yeah, I would think that we'll see AI probably still do well.Apple, all these companies as they continue to compete with one another. But a lot of the other companies not necessarily doing so great.DIANE KING HALL: So can you name more of those companies, besides Nike, that where you expect to see some stress. Would these be consumer company-- consumer-facing companies or where are you expecting to see this stress?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, we started with banks so I think the banks can set the tone for sure. And if they do not come in great or worse than expected, right?I mean, the thing with earnings seasons, first of all, is that it's always looking backwards and it's really about what the actual number is versus the expectation that has the greatest impact to the market. And even that is, sometimes, a short-term impact. So the longer term impact generally is what they project going forward, the guidance.And so, yeah, I mean-- I mean, like, let's take some of the high flyers in terms of the consumer space that we've seen in the past, Lululemon being one. I think that those kind of companies could actually start to feel the strain.Whereas some of the fast food companies that had had stress could actually start to come back a little bit. You know, like a McDonald's, for example.So I think that that's really-- you have to think what's going to be if everything we've just talked about, Diane, turns out to be true.

Yahoo Finance Healthcare Reporter Anjalee Khemlani highlights Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla's comments on Pfizer's stock outlook and plans to return capital to investors.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, after a huge windfall during the pandemic, many investors are eagerly awaiting to find out what Pfizer's next move is going to be. It's currently going through a $43 billion deal with Seagen. But following that, could shareholder benefits be on the table.Anjalee Khemlani, following the story for us. Anj, what can we expect?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, Seana, that last part is exactly what shareholders are looking for, some sort of benefit from this windfall. Questions about what the pipeline looks like for Pfizer, they've really had to prove their mettle when it comes to this M&amp;A activity, in particular, Seagen, again, with that big deal, but then also looking at beyond that.And it's something that really has actually been on the mind of both Pfizer and its CEO for quite some time. So a recent Goldman Sachs analyst noted that after the Seagen deal, quote, ""management would look to increase the extent of capital they return to shareholders through both share repurchases and greater dividend increases relative to prior years, is something that they're looking for discussing with the management as well.Meanwhile, we've had conversations with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla just about the stock and how shareholders have reacted. We know that it's one of the only companies that didn't necessarily benefit stock-wise in the same way you saw other competitors like Moderna and Novavax and J&amp;J, get a little bit of that boost during the pandemic.Pfizer shot has-- stock has tended to stay within a certain range. And so that hasn't really changed even after all these deals, even after the tens of billions of dollars in the COVID windfall. So it really is interesting to keep an eye on. We've heard him, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tell us, quote, ""The multiple that is assigned to our stock is bottom of the range."" He's been frustrated by the reaction from the stock market in the past.Story continuesBut what I remember, you know, back in 2019 prior to the pandemic and prior to any of this happening, was when Pfizer was really looking forward to being a leaner, greener machine, you know, really focusing on innovation, peeling back on its generics and its consumer business with Upjohn and that spinoff.And so I remember him saying, quote, that the company will continue to have financial flexibility to invest in growth while returning capital to the investor. So those already on the table and it seems like just a matter of time on when this timeline could happen and when the shareholders can get an answer to this question because Pfizer is certainly sitting on a lot of cash right now.They are making moves. And they do have to boost their pipeline because of the patent cliffs that they're facing. And so after that, maybe that conversation happens, so something will be around. So, of course, watch and report back.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, shares off over 30% in the past year. And Anjalee Khemlani, thanks.]"

This represents 7.64% of outstanding shares in Caribou, according to Reuters' calculation based on Refinitiv IBES data.The investment in the cell therapy developer follows a string of deals made by Pfizer over the past few years with the drugmaker flush with cash from sales of its COVID-19 products.In 2021, Pfizer had made an initial upfront investment of $500 million, including a $350 million share purchase, in migraine drug maker Biohaven Pharmaceutical, a company it acquired the following year.It also made a $25 million equity investment in Akero Therapeutics last year. Akero is developing a drug to treat a type of fatty liver disease called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which affects 5% of Americans but currently has no approved treatments.California-based Caribou was founded jointly by Jennifer Doudna, a co-recipient of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a genome editing process using CRISPR - a method used by bacterial defense system for millions of years to protect themselves against viruses.Caribou, which is developing cell therapies using CRISPR genome editing, said on Thursday it would use the proceeds from Pfizer's investment to advance its experimental CAR-T cell therapy, CB-011, that is currently being tested in an early-stage trial in patients with a type of blood cancer.(Reporting by Raghav Mahobe and Leroy Leo in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)]"

Currently, the only marketed product in the company’s portfolio is its COVID-19 vaccine, whose sales have started to plunge as the majority of the population across the globe has been immunized and governments across the world encourage their citizens to resume pre-pandemic behavior.The regulatory filings are based on positive data from an interim analysis of the pivotal phase III ConquerRSV study. Data from the study showed that participants who received mRNA-1345 achieved vaccine efficacy of 83.7% against RSV-LRTD, defined by two or more symptoms of the disease in older adults. The vaccine also achieved 82.4% efficacy against RSV-LRTD, defined by three or more symptoms of the disease. mRNA-1345 was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified.Shares of Moderna have lost 31.2% year to date compared with the industry’s 10.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf approved, Moderna’s RSV vaccine will face stiff competition from GSK GSK and Pfizer PFE, which have recently received approvals from the FDA for their respective RSV vaccines, Arexvy and Abrysvo, to prevent RSV-LRTD in older adults. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) recommended both GSK and Pfizer RSV vaccines for older adults. The vaccines are expected to be launched during the upcoming fall season.Story continuesThe FDA approval of GSK’s Arexvy and Pfizer’s Abrysvo was based on data from pivotal studies that evaluated these vaccines. The data supporting GSK’s vaccine showed overall vaccine efficacy of 82.6% against RSV-LRTD and the Pfizer vaccine achieved a vaccine efficacy of 85.7% against RSV-LRTD, as defined by three or more symptoms of the disease.Pfizer and Moderna are also evaluating their vaccines for use in other patient populations. While Moderna is also evaluating mRNA-1345 in an ongoing phase I study in pediatric populations, a regulatory filing for Pfizer’s Abrysvo is already under review, seeking label expansion for use in pregnant individuals to prevent RSV-LRTD in infants from birth up to six months of age. A final decision is expected later this year, in August.In separate news, Moderna reportedly signed a memorandum of understanding and a land collaboration agreement to research, develop and manufacture mRNA medicines in China. While a local Chinese media outlet reported that Moderna could make an investment worth $1 billion, a Reuters article also reported that any medicine developed under this agreement will be exclusive to China and “will not be exported.”This investment is likely being made by Moderna with the intent to exploit market opportunities in China amidst the rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. Moderna has been keen on selling its COVID vaccine in China, but the country has been insisting on using Chinese-made vaccines for its population.Being one of the most populous countries in the world, China is an attractive market for pharmaceuticals. The country houses an aging population that suffers from several harmful diseases.Last month, a Financial Times article reported that AstraZeneca AZN had similar concerns about the rising geopolitical risk between the two countries and has been engaged in drafting plans to spin off its China business and list it separately in Hong Kong. This will likely allow AstraZeneca to insulate itself politically from the Chinese government’s crackdown on foreign companies by making it a more plausibly domestic Chinese business. A domestic listing will also bolster the country’s support for AstraZeneca’s drug innovations and secure faster marketing approvals for therapies.Moderna, Inc. PriceModerna, Inc.

According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customer. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)Story continuespaypal, buy, rose, business, app, editorial, technology, touch, computer, phablet, mobile, woman, electronic, smartphone, payment, purchase, background, device, online,Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings, Inc.

175,571d1dd8-ccd7-3bfc-ae67-0b6b8c0d9230,PYPL,2023-07-07,Twitter owner Elon Musk has taken first steps in creating an ‘everything app’ to rival WeChat. It’s going to be an uphill battle,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-owner-elon-musk-taken-195912364.html,1688673552,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Elon Musk wants Twitter to be an “everything app,” which includes peer-to-peer payments, and has taken the first steps toward that goal by securing crucial financial licenses in three states. But, according to company insiders who spoke to Fortune, the next steps are unclear as chaos reigns, regulatory hurdles loom, and potential competitors like Venmo and PayPal dominate the market.Under the ownership of the cost-cutting Musk, the social media giant has encountered numerous obstacles, including lawsuits and severe website malfunctions. More than 80% of Twitter’s workforce has been let go or resigned, leading to a scarcity of engineers with expertise in the platform’s legacy systems, hindering efforts to address the myriad bugs plaguing the platform. It’s also left fewer engineers to spin up a payments system seeking to serve hundreds of millions of users.From the start of his tenure leading the social media platform, Musk has signaled that he wants the company to be something more—an “everything app” he calls “X,” mirroring China’s WeChat, which in addition to messaging allows for payments and e-commerce. Securing regulatory licenses is an important first step in enabling payment services, although some employees doubt that he can pull off the complicated logistics, even with newly appointed CEO Linda Yaccarino trying to build trust at the embattled company.“I don’t think the everything app will happen within one year. You need revenue to support everything that has to happen to build it,” a former Twitter staffer with knowledge of the payments plan told Fortune. “Having said that, if Linda is able to strike good and high-value partnership deals, that can change things.”Musk has long had ambitions to establish a comprehensive online banking institution. In 1999, he invested $12 million to cofound X.com alongside former Intuit CEO Bill Harris. The launch of X.com proved successful, with over 200,000 sign-ups recorded within just two months, a milestone especially impressive because it came at a time before most people were comfortable with online financial transactions.Story continuesHowever, the company faced a litany of issues that parallel Twitter’s today. According to Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, a biography of the billionaire written by tech journalist Ashlee Vance, X.com’s computing systems failed to cope with a rapidly growing customer base. The company’s website collapsed on a weekly basis and left the platform vulnerable to fraud, resulting in significant financial losses without a path toward profit. The lack of a cohesive business model and doubts about Musk’s decision-making compounded these challenges, which led the board to oust him as CEO. Tech mogul Peter Thiel took over and renamed X.com PayPal.“Musk rarely lets a slight go unpunished,” Vance wrote in the biography. “Throughout this ordeal, however, he showed incredible restraint.”Fast-forward to today, and Musk seems to have done everything but let this go. In an interview last month with CNBC, Musk says PayPal is “sort of a half-baked version of what it could be.” He has been vocal about his intolerance for boards, firing the Twitter board immediately upon acquisition, perhaps to avoid a similar coup like that at PayPal. He renamed Twitter as X, he has a son named X, and Musk bought X.com from PayPal in 2017 because “it has great sentimental value.”He’s also reignited his hopes of building a global payments platform. Though Twitter flirted with payment services before his tenure—including setting up the subsidiary Twitter Payments LLC and dabbling with crypto—Musk floated payment tools as a potential revenue driver in a deck he presented to potential investors before the takeover.“I think there’s potential to create a more efficient financial system,” Musk said in the CNBC interview, adding that it would be “poetic to fulfill ultimately the vision that I had for X over 23 years ago, and actually see that come to fruition.”After Musk became CEO in October, Twitter began to apply for federal and state regulatory licenses, according to a January report from the Financial Times. Beginning in late June, Michigan, Missouri, and New Hampshire were the first three states to grant them.Money transmitter licenses are a step below what’s required of trusts or banks—they allow companies to take money from users and send it, although they can’t hold deposits as a bank would. Securing money transmitter licenses in states across the country, Twitter could begin to implement peer-to-peer payment services similar to Venmo or PayPal.Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and financial services expert, said companies apply for money transmitter licenses “because you actually want to handle the money and it’s the fastest route to do it with the least brain damage,” compared with applying for trust or banking charters. “This just tells me Elon wants in on payments.”With Twitter likely to be approved as a money transmitter in most states, the looming question is whether it would be able to compete with established players like Venmo or PayPal. Stephanie Choo, a general partner at fintech-focused venture capital firm Portage Ventures, said Twitter would need to be “10 times better” than rivals, which it could accomplish through rewards systems. Even then, there is little precedent for messaging apps implementing payment services outside of the “everything app” giants of Asia, with WhatsApp and Telegram both lagging with rollout.Choo said the most interesting version of Twitter’s payments plan would be to build out globally, with competitors like PayPal and Wise still struggling to build comprehensive networks. The main obstacle to international growth is securing financial licenses in every individual jurisdiction, and Choo said the commonsense path forward would be digital wallets, likely powered with crypto.Although Musk has signaled interest in crypto through his other companies and professed love of Dogecoin, enabling crypto payments could create regulatory headaches for the social media platform. Even with money transmitter licenses, Twitter would have to set up accounts with banks, which have shown a reluctance to onboarding crypto-focused businesses.“The harder part now is the amount of regulatory scrutiny to have a regulated bank work with you, and I just don’t see Twitter buying a bank, which is one of the ways to do this,” Choo said. “But I bet they have enough clout in market to get an operating account.”The final hurdle would be empowering Twitter’s skeletal staff to build out a payment platform to compete with the giants. One current employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the last count for full-time employees was just around 1,400, down from around 8,000 before Musk’s takeover. By comparison, PayPal has nearly 30,000 employees.“There are certainly not enough people to fully implement anything new,” the employee said, “without inevitable issues.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +7.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 7.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.16 per share, indicating a change of +24.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 points to a change of +19.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.68 indicates a change of +14.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.51 billion and $32.13 billion estimates indicate +7.2% and +8.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.69%. The EPS surprise was +6.36%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

183,204c9dbb-f51d-3a8c-9790-1354dd21a656,IBM,2023-07-07,Here is What to Know Beyond Why International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-international-business-130011288.html,1688648411,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -0.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.98 per share, indicating a change of -14.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.32 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.1%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.77 indicates a change of +4.9% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $61.9 billion and $64.14 billion estimates indicate +2.3% and +3.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.4%. EPS of $1.36 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.15%. The EPS surprise was +7.09%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

184,28fe2c55-ab4f-3ddd-a345-475c21ea640d,MPC,2023-07-07,10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-natural-gas-stocks-171338750.html,1688663618,STORY,"['CHK', 'NEE', 'MPC', 'OXY', 'COP', 'XOM']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 best natural gas stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the natural gas industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now.Natural gas is one of the most used energy sources in the world. In the US alone, it accounted for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021, and in the electricity sector, it accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production.In 2022, fuel prices including natural gas peaked due to the Russia-Ukraine war which led to sanctions on Russia, resulting in pressure on European and global gas markets. However, due to favorable weather conditions and actions taken by the governments, the pressure on the market eased a little since the beginning of 2023. In Europe, natural gas consumption fell by almost 55 billion cubic meters year-over-year during the 2022/2023 heating season, marking the steepest decline in consumption for any recorded winter season. Furthermore, to avoid further pressures due to the cut-off from Russian exports, the European Union has also unveiled a 210 billion euro plan to completely be rid of Russian fossil fuel dependence by 2027. Compared to 2022, the Russian pipeline gas consumption is expected to drop around 45% in 2023. Nevertheless, In Asia and the Middle East, the natural gas demand is expected to increase by 3% and 2%, respectively, The higher demand from these regions will offset most of the drop in demand from Europe and the US in 2023 which is expected to decline by 5% and 2%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2023, the natural gas average price at Henry Hub was $2.55 per Metric Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), which showed an almost 40% YoY decline and a 57% sequential decline. The natural gas price was $4.55 per MMBtu in Q1 2022 and $5.92 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2022. Between mid-December and the first quarter of 2023, natural gas prices dropped by around 70% in Northeast Asian, North American, and European markets.Story continuesThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its short-term energy outlook on June 6 which reveals that the US natural gas production set a monthly record in April with 104 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) production. In the previous month, it was 102 billion cubic feet per day. The EIA expects natural gas production to average around 103 Bcfd in the second half of 2023. According to the EIA’s outlook, natural gas prices are expected to remain conservative in the second half of the year too with an estimated $2.60 per MMBtu average price in the third quarter of 2023. One of the main reasons for these low prices is overstocked inventory. In May, natural gas storage inventories were 15% above the 5-year average.Despite having a rough time, natural gas prices can still increase over time as it has been a key source of fuel in reducing global carbon emissions. On top of that, if a dry or hotter-than-usual summer comes along and gets followed by a cold winter, the commodity can experience high price volatility. On June 26, natural gas futures to their peak in two months and have since dropped by 6.8% on June 30.Even though natural gas prices are under pressure due to several factors, the commodity is still expected to play a huge role in the energy industry until renewable energy completely takes over fossil fuels. Due to low prices, natural gas stocks are also experiencing a decline in their stock prices. To take advantage of the situation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best stocks to look out for.10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Nowvovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we chose the natural gas companies according to their hedge fund sentiment as of the first quarter of 2022.

Roman &amp; Associates CEO and former FAA commercial pilot Anthony C. Roman told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).The flight disruptions during the July 4 weekend came as a record 2.8 million Americans traveled by plane on Friday alone, per the FAA. According to FlightAware, 3,800 flights were canceled and 45,000 were delayed in the past week, frustrating customers and airlines themselves, who have pointed fingers at the FAA.The ongoing instability in the aviation industry has a complex backstory, and it originates from the pandemic, Roman said. During that time, airlines announced mass layoffs, and pilots, flight attendants, and baggage handlers took early retirements, he said. The industry turbulence was compounded by a lack of infrastructure investment to modernize airports and vital FAA technology for tracking planes. Flight controller shortages have hurt as well.All of that has forced airlines, airports, and the FAA to solve multiple problems at the same time.“I think we’re close to the breaking point,” Roman said.However, he pointed to some signs that could ease travelers’ frustration in the months to come. For example, United Airlines (UAL) has offered passengers who suffer “significant delays” or cancellations 30,000 miles in flight points. Other airlines, like Delta (DAL), are faring better because they have invested more in infrastructure intended to avoid flight issues, Roman explained.Planes are seen on the tarmac as people wait for their flight rescheduled inside of the Newark International Airport on June 27, 2023, in Newark, New Jersey. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images) (Kena Betancur via Getty Images)Facing regular turmoil, airlines are lobbying the FAA and Congress to take urgent steps to confront problems in the industry. Despite objections from some pilot groups, a House panel last month voted to raise the mandatory commercial pilot retirement age from 65 to 67, which would “help immensely” by keeping Baby Boomer pilots in the air for longer, Roman said. The House is expected to consider the bill this month.Story continuesIn the long term, both the FAA and airlines are accelerating efforts to recruit, hire, and train air traffic controllers and pilots, which Roman said will help improve air traffic management in a year or two. For now, though, holiday weekends like July 4 continue to see challenges.“All of that is surging now, and you have all of the problems trying to be solved at once,” Roman said. “It's going to take several years to do this.”Jared Mitovich is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:PNC) will increase its dividend on the 5th of August to $1.55, which is 3.3% higher than last year's payment from the same period of $1.50. This will take the annual payment to 4.8% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much.PNC Financial Services Group has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Based on PNC Financial Services Group's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 41%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 2.4% over the next 3 years. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 44% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.historic-dividendPNC Financial Services Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.60, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $6.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.PNC Financial Services Group Could Grow Its DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. PNC Financial Services Group has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.3% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Story continuesWe Really Like PNC Financial Services Group's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Mills Inc. GIS, Worthington Industries Inc. WOR, The Greenbrier Companies Inc. GBX, The PNC Financial Services Group Inc. PNC and GasLog Partners LP GLOP.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks in Focus Based on Recent Dividend HikesU.S. stock markets had a dream rally in the first half of 2023 after a disappointing 2022. Wall Street achieved several milestones in the first half of this year. The broad-market index — the S&amp;P 500 — formed a new bull market during this period. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite recorded their best first-half since 2019 and 1983, respectively. The Dow relatively lagged. Yet, the blue-chip index managed to finish the first half in green.Despite these fabulous performances, we are not out of the woods. On Jun 14, in his post-FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank has decided to keep the Fed fund rate unchanged at the existing rate of 5-5.25%.However, Powell also mentioned that more rate hikes are likely this year. The Fed's current ""dot-plot"" shows that the mean expectation of officials is for another 50-basis point raise in the benchmark interest rate. This implies two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each within 2023.The terminal interest rate is at present 5.6%, instead of the 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting. No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025.At present, the CME FedWatch assigned an 87.5% probability to a Fed fund rate hike of 25 basis points in the July FOMC meeting. Only, 12.5% of respondents think the lending rate will remain the same.Story continuesStocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Intuitive Surgical share price has climbed 89% in five years, easily topping the market return of 49% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 58%.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.5%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Intuitive Surgical achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 14% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 88.17.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Intuitive Surgical's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Intuitive Surgical shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over one year. That's better than the annualised return of 14% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

193,d79c2546-f473-3a44-9a81-077e6938540c,ISRG,2023-07-07,12 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-robotics-stocks-buy-154518106.html,1688658318.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TSLA', 'PATH', 'TMO', 'ZBRA', 'AME', 'ROK', 'KITT', 'HLX', 'TER', 'AMBA']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best robotics stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our analysis of the robotics industry, how it is gradually affecting several walks of life, and want to skip ahead to the top five stocks on this list, then take a look at 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now. One trend that is slowly taking over the industrial world and making slow inroads into consumer use as well, is the growing use of robotics. Their utility, particularly in heavy duty industrial manufacturing and tasks that are often hazardous to humans has created new opportunities for growth and cost efficiencies.In fact, as the world was reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the use of robotics in industries actually grew. Data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) shows that when it came to the food and beverages industry, the use of robotics grew by 25% in 2021 to sit at 3,402 units as they provided a handy way of continuing business and adhering to social distancing requirements at the same time. And while the use of robots in the food industry was in the thousands, as a whole, more than half a million robots are deployed across various industries such as chemicals, automobile manufacturing, and plastic production. These sectors often carry hazards to human health, as they require handling dangerous materials, heavy equipment, or conducting repetitive tasks.The growth in the use of robotics is part of a growing trend toward automation that provides firms with an opportunity to streamline their operations and reduce worker costs. According to McKinsey, automation can boost global productivity by as much as 1.4% each year and it could even cut paid positions in half. The nature of its products, which are heavy machines that require significant manual labor otherwise, has also led to the automotive industry being one of the biggest users of robotics by accounting for 29% of global automation demand as of 2022.Story continuesBuilding on this, the global robotics industry was worth $27 billion in 2020 and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.45% to be worth $74 billion by 2027. As should be expected, automotive production and industrialization will play a key role in this market. Some of the top industrial robotics companies in the world are Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), ABB Ltd (OTCMKTS:ABBNY), and DENSO Corporation (OTCMKTS:DNZOY), and for more details on this highly lucrative robotics niche, you can check out Top 10 Industrial Robotics Companies in the World.Taking a deeper look at what some of these firms are doing, ABB Ltd (OTCMKTS:ABBNY), one of the most proactive robotics firms in the world, is right at the top of its game as it has already started to consider how to bring artificial intelligence to industrial robotics. The firm has partnered up with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to integrate AI into industrial processes for reducing machine downtime and increasing equipment lifespans. It will also allow decision makers to consolidate operational data with their decision making processes to provide better insights.Another highly consequential robotics firm, particularly when it comes to healthcare use is Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). Its robots, as the name suggests, aid surgeons conduct some of the most difficult tasks in the world. And on this front, Intuitive scored a big win earlier this year when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its da Vinci surgical system for use in simple prostate surgery where doctors remove portions of an enlarged prostate to ensure smooth urinal flow. The system was also approved for a prostate surgery procedure where the entire gland is removed, often for patients that have prostate cancer. And while these are established companies with a large operations base, newer and younger companies are also entering the industry.One such firm is Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (NASDAQ:KITT) which went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021 in a $150 million initial public offering. The IPO was one of many during a time when SPACs were quite popular with retail investors, who flocked to them in droves due to the potential for share price appreciation. Nauticus is an interesting robotics firm, with a business model that is called robotics as a service (RaaS). This allows firms to use robots on a subscription basis, enabling them to save up on capital expenditures and utilize cost savings and efficiencies at the same time. However, the very expectation of a high return through an IPO also led to the shares of Nauticus' SPAC firm Cleantech tanking by 35% when shareholders approved the IPO since it also disclosed that roughly 1.4 million shares would be available for trading while retail investors had believed the float would be lower.As to what's happening in the robotics industry right now, here's what the management of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) had to say during the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings conference:One of our large multiyear wins in eCommerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell’s smart machine architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale. Another important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic’s disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications. Moving to our Hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top robotics stocks, out of which the notable names are Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG).12 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the best robotics stocks, we first made a list of all robotics companies operating in industrial, healthcare, software (yes there are software robots, as part of robotic process automation systems), and other domains.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for CSX, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$6.1b ÷ (US$41b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, CSX has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for CSX roceIn the above chart we have measured CSX's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for CSX.How Are Returns Trending?CSX is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 39% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On CSX's ROCETo bring it all together, CSX has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with a respectable 65% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CSX can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.If you want to continue researching CSX, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.While CSX isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ADI) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.83bUS$5.44bUS$6.53bUS$7.04bUS$7.42bUS$7.74bUS$8.03bUS$8.29bUS$8.53bUS$8.76bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.41%Est @ 4.42%Est @ 3.73%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10.0% US$4.4kUS$4.5kUS$4.9kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.6kUS$3.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$43bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10.0%– 2.1%) = US$113bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$113b÷ ( 1 + 10.0%)10= US$44bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$86b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$190, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Analog Devices as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.328. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Analog DevicesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

This unforeseen turn of events has left investors scrambling for answers, eagerly awaiting the Federal Reserve's explanation and insight into their decision-making process. According to Bloomberg, The clarification from the Federal Reserve will be crucial in understanding the reasoning behind their divergence from the expected course of action and the potential implications for the financial markets. As market participants eagerly analyze the forthcoming details, they hope to gain a deeper understanding of the factors considered by the Federal Reserve and the potential impact on future economic conditions.Despite the growing risks, prominent bond managers, including Brandywine Global Investment Management, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, and Vanguard Group Inc., continue to hold a positive outlook on the US government debt market. They maintain their bullish stance, expecting a robust rally in fixed-income assets. However, this optimistic view faces challenges as the economy demonstrates resilience, potentially diminishing the appeal of bonds, and with the Federal Reserve contemplating raising interest rates. These factors introduce uncertainty and test the conviction of these bond managers in their bullish position, reported Bloomberg.Story continuesAccording to Reuters, labeling this year's equity market rally as solely driven by a few AI-powered stocks may misrepresent the situation and could actually be a source of strength. Despite the impressive 16% surge in the S&amp;P500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq's best first half in 40 years, concerns over a potential recession led investors to dismiss the rebound as narrow and unsustainable. Critics argue that an equal-weight version of the S&amp;P500 has only seen a modest 6% gain, while the remaining 490 stocks gained just 4%. The FANG+TM index, consisting of mega-cap tech stocks, soared by 75%. These stocks are among the largest globally, and their prominence in diversified portfolios makes them hard to overlook. Moreover, the estimated $7.1 trillion worth of indexed assets closely tracking the world's most prominent benchmark index may not be overly concerned about the specifics of how the 16% gain was achieved.The UK government and central bank find themselves heading towards a collision course as they grapple with the blame game surrounding the country's economic challenges. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May remained at a concerning 8.7%, unchanged from the previous month. Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco prices, reached its highest level in 31 years at 7.1%. The UK is facing a combination of economic woes, with stagnant economic growth and public debt surpassing 100% of GDP for the first time since March 1961. Shaan Raithatha, a senior economist at Vanguard, emphasized the severity of the situation, stating that the country is experiencing the ""worst of both worlds"" during an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" The clash between the government and central bank highlights the need for a unified approach to addressing rising inflation, sluggish growth, and mounting debt. Criticism is directed towards the government's policies, while pressure mounts on the central bank to implement measures to tackle inflationary pressures.On the stocks market front, analysts are bearish on biotech firm BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

We believe Jeff has been an astute allocator of capital and has created tremendous shareholder value over the long term. Jeff will be retiring from SBA at the end of 2023.We believe a series of issues are likely to temper SBA’s growth in the next few years, including higher debt refinancing costs, wireless carrier decommissioning, headwinds from the company’s Latin American operations, and perhaps foreign exchange headwinds. Our sense is that the company’s annual cash flow growth will decelerate from 14% in 2022 to just 3% in 2023 and remain at modest annual growth rates over the next few years. The company’s high leverage, approximately 6.9 times net debt to cash flow, will limit the company’s ability for share repurchases and external growth opportunities.”06. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is one of the largest oil and gas equipment companies in the world. Like several others, it is also headquartered in Houston, Texas.

Josh Silverstein, an analyst at UBS, has decided to maintain a Buy rating on Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) as of July 3. However, there has been a decrease in the price target, which has been adjusted from $49 to $46.Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. Investor concerns surrounding the impact that recent softness in crude oil and natural gas prices would have on the overall level of production activity weighed on the company’s stock in the quarter. However, the recent commitment by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce production to balance global supply and demand should support healthy levels of activity specifically within North American shale, where Halliburton is a market leader. Over the longer term, we believe the company also should lay a pivotal role in helping exploration and production companies navigate ongoing productivity declines.”Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10 Martin Shkreli Stock Picks and Their Performance10 Special Situation Penny Stocks With Near Term CatalystsDisclosure.

208,0cab03ce-31de-3e1d-9c59-cd02eb03dcc1,VZ,2023-07-07,"With 63% ownership, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/63-ownership-verizon-communications-inc-110229635.html,1688727749,STORY,['VZ'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Verizon Communications' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 63% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Verizon Communications. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Verizon Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Verizon Communications, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Verizon Communications. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Verizon Communications Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$40m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Verizon Communications. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Verizon Communications  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Raymond James Telecommunications Analyst Frank Louthan sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to detail AI deployment at data centers and telecom companies' slow rates of change and technological adoption.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Also everyone, since we're talking about AI, AI is the new buzzword with demand skyrocketing and industries grappling with the changing tech landscape. But our next guest says that while AI might offer a magic elixir, it may not necessarily be a hockey stick inflection for one sector, that's Telecom. Frank Louthan, who is the Raymond James telecommunications analyst, joins us now. Frank, great to have you here with us this morning. All right, so what is the magical elixir perhaps here, as you look at it from your perspective?FRANK LOUTHAN: Yeah, we look at this as a team perspective. We've taken a deep dive into AI. And from my side, where I stay covering telecom and data services providers, this is absolutely a positive for them, there's the tailwind. But it's just more of the thing that keeps the growth going, it's not necessarily a hockey stick inflection like we've seen with some of the other sectors, like chips and so forth, that are more directly involved.But there's absolutely going to be more demand from AI going to data centers, going to fiber providers, and network providers, and wireless carriers, that is going to keep the growth going over the next few years. It's just a lot more muted than people might think in it's early days and how it's impacting the sectors.- Frank, I don't know if you just got a chance to hear our anchor, Seana Smith, talking about Morgan Stanley's price target on Microsoft, and seeing where Microsoft lands in terms of the AI space. Who in the telecom space, would you say, are the leaders and have the best chance at taking advantage of this huge focus on AI, and particularly generative AI?Story continuesFRANK LOUTHAN: Yeah, absolutely. So the data centers that we cover, Equinix and Digital Realty Trust, are the ones that are the most directly affected in the short term. That's where companies like Microsoft and cloud providers are going to be deploying their AI engines, they're going to be deploying various things for the AI instances, and you'll be deploying them for the training modules, and so forth. And that's where you're going to see that.And also, we're already starting to see it on the margin with some pricing and so forth, at some data centers, where some of the AI deployments are paying very high prices to get access to data. And the real important thing there is, when you look at AI, it's generally run by GPUs versus CPUs. And GPUs use more power. When you look at the data center industry, they sell power, they don't sell space.So as you have a demand driver that's going to use a lot more energy, and so forth, that's a very good driver for demand. So we would look at Equinix and Digital Realty as the two most directly impacted by the sector, with the telecommunications networks being after that.BRAD SMITH: And so some of the names, specifically within this, and break down some more of those, because you mentioned Equinix. But there are a few others, Akamai, even within that coverage that you're looking across with this.FRANK LOUTHAN: Yeah, absolutely. Akamai is another one the content delivery networks are going to benefit, because you have to remember, someone's got to get the data in and out of the data center, and in and out of the AI engine, and so forth, for all the applications. So you're going to need those delivery networks. But then Akamai and others have also developed software security platforms, which are going to be important as well. When you're moving all that data, and you're putting it into these various AI platforms, there's going to be increased attacks on software security.You're going to need increased security for the data that you're collecting. Plus data is going to need to be collected and deployed on a much broader basis. You can even make a case that you're going to need to use AI out further in the edge of networks to better filter the type of information that's being sent back, so you don't send everything back, because it ends up being very costly.So we think the content delivery networks also benefit. And then of course, those that provide fiber, and so forth. And eventually, you'll see something on the wireless side. Americans value entertainment and convenience above almost all else.And at some point, if you're to have a successful commercial AI device, it's going to need to work on a cell phone. So at some point that will drive more traffic there as well. But all of these things take more time, and which is why we think the more direct beneficiaries, in the near term at least, are the data centers and then probably the CDN.- So I want to really quickly broaden this out to something you also say in your note. You said the AI debate really should be about degree rather than direction. And, of course, we know that the spending is happening, the investment is happening. But is it big enough to turn this into a question, and broad enough to offset any kind of headwinds coming?FRANK LOUTHAN: I definitely think it is. Again, it's just slow. All these things are gradual changes. We like to say about telecom that the rate of changes is very slow, even when it speeds up. I've been covering this industry for a long time, and there's still copper phone lines out there. So it takes a long time for the industry to transition.But when you see a data transition like this, or a technology transition, like we saw cloud computing a few years ago, and so forth, it is a positive, it does tend to, over time, replace older technology and continue to keep the growth going. So that's why we're confident in the growth rates we have for our companies, going forward, because this is coming on the back side and going to continue to push revenue and replace roll, or technology falls off.BRAD SMITH: Frank, would much rather ask a question about that SIC Les Paul you got in the background there, but I do want to include within our conversation here, at least for the day. What is the timeline that investors should be keeping in mind when they're talking about this type of transformation, and how AI could potentially impact the telecommunications sector?FRANK LOUTHAN: Yeah, so when you look over the next two or three years, I think you'll see it be more pervasive. So for example, the data centers that I referenced, Equinix and DR, both said that AI is a part of their conversation. But it's still a very small part of their bookings, so it's not quite here in a real meaningful way.And I would say the same thing for the telecom providers, and so forth. It's something that, when we talk to them, they've all had conversations with their customers. It's things that they're aware of. They're trying to be positioned for when the demand is there. But it's still, on a relative basis, a very small amount of computing platforms in deployments and network traffic.So I would say you fast forward about three years, we'll see it will be much more pervasive, but it's definitely something that's creating a lot of conversation. And again, if you look at what's going to continue the growth case over the next year as other technologies start to fall off, I think you can say AI is the thing that's going to come up and instill in the demand void, going forward.- Well that was certainly the case in the last round of earnings. We'll see if that's the buzzword this round. Frank Louthan, Raymond James telecommunications analyst. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.]"

LUCIE, Fla., July 06, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Port St. Lucie, FL. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Port St. Lucie include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, more people in Port St. Lucie now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service has recently expanded to areas near River Park, Verano, St Lucie West, Lyngate Park, Post St. Lucie RV Resort, and SW Gatlin Blvd around the I95 shopping area.Port St. Lucie’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Port St. Lucie will be able to take advantage of nearly twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust servicesLastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Port St. Lucie. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Port St. Lucie area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Our engineers are working tirelessly to bring an exceptionally reliable 5G network experience to more areas in Port St. Lucie,” said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “We know how critical reliable connections are for residents and visitors in this area and we work everyday to ensure we deliver for them.”With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with countless opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Port St. Lucie, FL customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Port St. Lucie, FL, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.

The two no-frills Marshalls locations (owned and operated by TJX Companies) I popped into for some silverware — one on Saturday and the other on Sunday. Both stores looked as if angry bulls had run amok in the aisles — everything was that messy and picked over. Cut in line at your own risk, the places were mobbed with deal seekers.These three holiday occurrences sent me back to reconnect on the state of consumer stocks ahead of the pivotal back-to-school shopping season.I was reminded how hated consumer names are right now, as seen in new Bank of America data.Consumer discretionary stocks are at the lowest exposure among hedge fund managers and long-only managers in the history of Bank of America's data set.""Resilient consumption in the face of inflation pressures, a slackening labor market, and a host of other factors is seen as unsustainable by most portfolio managers,"" said BofA's top equity strategist Savita Subramanian.Story continuesSubramanian added, ""faith in the consumer is waning.""Ouch.The top 20 most-shorted S&amp;P 500 stocks — as presented by BofA — are dominated by companies deemed consumer discretionary.The top five includes Dish Network (you definitely don't need expensive Dish Network services); Ralph Lauren (don't need an $80 polo shirt from Macy's); CarMax (you can live with your 100,000-mile road warrior a little longer in a land of higher financing costs); Paramount (do you really need Paramount+?); CH Robinson (a logistics play that ships stuff you probably don't need).This positioning reeks of investors banking on a second-half consumer collapse.But perhaps all of this negativity on the consumer shouldn't come as a surprise.The jobs market is slowing. Stories about AI taking jobs continue to populate (here's what musician and tech investor will.i.am told us recently on the topic). Headline-grabbing layoffs continue to rip through the economy (see Disney's ESPN ""talent"" cuts).Further, nagging inflation has eaten into the trillions of dollars in pandemic savings.The personal savings rate sits at 4.6%, down from double-digits at the height of the pandemic and below the long-run average of 8.3%.Can't spend much if your paycheck is barely making ends meet and your savings account is as dried up as the Sahara.Should you be using this juncture to go against the crowd and scoop up retailers and other consumer-centric stocks? Beats me. I just buy Nike dunks and do news — I don't pick stocks anymore.I will say this though: It's hard to get too excited about many of these names in front of potentially two more interest rate hikes, a down-trending personal savings rate, and sticky inflation.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWavesAfter months of acrimony between the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), the two have agreed to flexibly implement the state’s toughest-in-the-nation emissions rules — even if someone else sues to stop the regulations.The Advanced Clean Truck Rule, which would remove internal combustion engines from California roads by 2045, remains in place. But California now will follow the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans for reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions in 2027 instead of its plan to require lower NOx emissions beginning in 2024.A single standard for emissions has been elusive. California received a waiver to the EPA regulations that allowed it to implement its own rules. OEMs said they agreed with the tougher standards but lacked sufficient time to make compliant engines by next year.“The unprecedented collaboration between California regulators and truck manufacturers marks a new era in our zero-emission future, where we work together to address the needs of both the trucking industry and the Californians who deserve to breathe clean air,” CARB Chair Liane Randolph said in a news release.Flexibility in implementing new emissions rules The EMA said the agreement provides the flexibility it needs to meet the standards for reducing soot-causing NOx emissions.“Through this agreement, we have aligned on a single nationwide nitrogen oxide emissions standard, secured needed lead time and stability for manufacturers, and agreed on regulatory changes that will ensure continued availability of commercial vehicles,” EMA President Jed Mandel said.The alignment of CARB with the EPA on the 2027 timing for toughening NOx regulations gives manufacturers time to test and validate technology to reduce NOx, such as Tula Technologies’ Dynamic SkipFire, shown in testing with Cummins Inc. to cut NOx emissions by 71%.Truckers feared that different rules for California, and states that follow them, could create a patchwork of rules inhibiting interstate commerce.Story continues“We appreciate CARB’s commitment to providing flexibility as we transition to zero emissions, and for their efforts to align with EPA’s 2027 standards,” said Shelley A. Knust, Cummins vice president of product compliance and regulatory affairs.Under the Clean Truck Partnership, CARB agreed to:Align with EPA’s 2027 regulations for NOx emissions and modify elements of the 2024 NOx emission regulations for which manufacturers will provide offsets as needed to meet California’s emission targets.Provide no less than four years lead time and at least three years of regulatory stability before imposing new requirements.Support the development of necessary zero emissions vehicle infrastructure.Truck manufacturers committed to meet CARB’s zero-emission and criteria pollutant regulations in the state regardless of any attempts by other entities to challenge California’s authority.ATA might be ready to rumbleThat may include the American Trucking Associations, which said in a statement that manufacturers should not be “strong-armed” into a compromise like the Clean Truck Partnership.“Our association represents motor carrier members — the paying customers who will inherit the costs of this agreement — and we will not roll over nor relinquish our right to litigate with any party when our interests are threatened,” ATA President and CEO Chris Spear said in a statement.“It is clear that America has lost its way when the government bullies the private sector to succumb to unachievable timelines, targets and technologies.”The EPA said equipment needed to meet the new restrictions would increase costs to truckers by $8,304 per long-haul single unit truck.Related articles:Truck makers take on EPA’s zero-emissions carbon ruleCongress overturns nitrogen oxide emissions rule for trucksTrucking industry worried after EPA issues final rule on NOx emissionsClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post CARB and engine manufacturers compromise on emissions timing appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The two no-frills Marshalls locations (owned and operated by TJX Companies) I popped into for some silverware — one on Saturday and the other on Sunday. Both stores looked as if angry bulls had run amok in the aisles — everything was that messy and picked over. Cut in line at your own risk, the places were mobbed with deal seekers.These three holiday occurrences sent me back to reconnect on the state of consumer stocks ahead of the pivotal back-to-school shopping season.I was reminded how hated consumer names are right now, as seen in new Bank of America data.Consumer discretionary stocks are at the lowest exposure among hedge fund managers and long-only managers in the history of Bank of America's data set.""Resilient consumption in the face of inflation pressures, a slackening labor market, and a host of other factors is seen as unsustainable by most portfolio managers,"" said BofA's top equity strategist Savita Subramanian.Story continuesSubramanian added, ""faith in the consumer is waning.""Ouch.The top 20 most-shorted S&amp;P 500 stocks — as presented by BofA — are dominated by companies deemed consumer discretionary.The top five includes Dish Network (you definitely don't need expensive Dish Network services); Ralph Lauren (don't need an $80 polo shirt from Macy's); CarMax (you can live with your 100,000-mile road warrior a little longer in a land of higher financing costs); Paramount (do you really need Paramount+?); CH Robinson (a logistics play that ships stuff you probably don't need).This positioning reeks of investors banking on a second-half consumer collapse.But perhaps all of this negativity on the consumer shouldn't come as a surprise.The jobs market is slowing. Stories about AI taking jobs continue to populate (here's what musician and tech investor will.i.am told us recently on the topic). Headline-grabbing layoffs continue to rip through the economy (see Disney's ESPN ""talent"" cuts).Further, nagging inflation has eaten into the trillions of dollars in pandemic savings.The personal savings rate sits at 4.6%, down from double-digits at the height of the pandemic and below the long-run average of 8.3%.Can't spend much if your paycheck is barely making ends meet and your savings account is as dried up as the Sahara.Should you be using this juncture to go against the crowd and scoop up retailers and other consumer-centric stocks? Beats me. I just buy Nike dunks and do news — I don't pick stocks anymore.I will say this though: It's hard to get too excited about many of these names in front of potentially two more interest rate hikes, a down-trending personal savings rate, and sticky inflation.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

While the move will naturally be criticized by many, the cost-cutting measures may be necessary for the media and entertainment giant to get back to days of sustained growth.Cost-Cutting Continued The high-profile layoffs last week follow Disney’s announcement earlier in the year that it would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $5.5 billion.Similarly, Meta Platforms (META) has sought to decrease its capital expenditures by reducing its staff and scaling back on its expansion into the metaverse.Shareholders had previously called for Meta to do so and investors appear to be on board with Disney cutting costs as well with the company stating it will help bring back its dividend by the end of the year.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAt the start of 2023, Disney had around $203.63 billion in total assets and $104.75 billion in total liabilities. However, total current assets stood at around $29.09 billion and just above its total current liabilities at $29.07 billion.Cash and equivalents of $11.61 billion decreased -21% from $15.95 billion in 2021 but have still climbed 180% over the last five years at $4.15 billion in 2018.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEffects on StreamingWall Street may be monitoring the effects the recent ESPN jobs cuts have on Disney’s ESPN+ streaming subscribers and the company’s Direct to Consumer segment. This is especially true as Disney+ subscribers have dipped for two consecutive quarters representing the only quarterly declines since its launch in 2019.To that point, the 25.3 million ESPN+ subscribers at the end of Q2 increased by 13.4% from the prior-year quarter. This certainly helps in competing with rival Netflix (NFLX) in terms of total streaming subscribers but Disney’s Direct to Consumer segment is still not profitable.Story continuesDirect to Consumer losses decreased by $200 million during Q2 but still posted an operating loss of -$700 million. Furthermore, Linear Networks are profitable but operating income decreased -35% to $1.8 billion compared to $2.8 billion in Q2 2022.According to Disney, the lower cable results were largely attributed to higher sports programming and production costs. This was driven by the timing of costs for the College Football Playoffs and the NFL, in addition to NBA contractual rate increases and higher sports production costs which coincide with the recent layoffs.DisneyImage Source: DisneyDisney’s OutlookAccording to Zacks estimates, Disney sales are now forecasted to rise 8% in fiscal 2023 and edge up another 5% in FY24 to $93.96 billion.On the bottom line, earnings are projected to be up 7% this year and soar 34% in FY24 at $5.10 per share. Notably, fiscal 2024 EPS projections would represent 152% growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $2.02 per share.This would also get Disney closer to 2018 and 2019 levels which saw EPS at $7.08 and $5.77 per share respectively, before the continued decline in the company’s bottom line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayDisney stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and while shares of DIS are only up +2% this year the company’s outlook has become more attractive and could be elevated by continued cost-cutting. In this regard, sustaining Linear Network income appears to be imperative and Disney is working to address the issue while continuing to reduce operating costs among its streaming services and Direct to Consumer segment as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The insiders, of course, are far more benign than the connotations of the name. They are corporate officers, residents of the C-suite, or members of the Board. Their positions give them a close-up view of a company’s inner workings, and that view guides them when they trade their own firms’ shares.The corporate insiders’ knowledge gives them an advantage in their trading, providing an edge over other traders in the same stocks. To maintain a level playing field, regulators require insiders to publish their trades, allowing the trading public to follow these transactions. The key point to remember is that insiders typically only buy their own stocks when they are certain the price will go up.We’ve used the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to get the lowdown on a pair of stocks that some insiders have splashed out at least $1 million on. The insiders are cautious in their trading activities, and their purchases of such substantial value demonstrate a clear willingness to take significant risks. These are the trades that retail investors should scrutinize closely.Now, let’s take a closer look at these trades and what the analysts have to say. This will help us understand why following their footsteps could be a smart move.Oneok, Inc. (OKE)Let’s begin with Oneok, a prominent midstream company specializing in natural gas. Oneok owns one of the top-rated natural gas liquids systems in the US, and its network connects the Permian, Mid-Continent, and Rocky Mountain regions with important market centers. Oneok’s network includes an array of natural gas gathering, processing, storage, and transport assets, making the company a leading provider of midstream services.This past May, Oneok made an important move to expand its network, with the announcement of its agreement to acquire Magellan Midstream Partners. The move will make Magellan a fully-owned subsidiary of Oneok, and give Oneok a presence on the Gulf Coast. The combined asset net work will include more than 25,000 miles of pipeline. The acquisition transaction is valued at $18.8 billion in cash and stock, and is expected to close during 3Q23.Story continuesHeading toward that transaction closing, we can look at Oneok’s most recent quarterly report, for a snapshot of how the company stands. Revenues for 1Q23 came in at $4.52 billion, falling almost 17% y/y and missing the forecast by $827 million. Earnings, however, beat the forecast; the EPS figure of $2.34 was 5 cents better than had been anticipated.Better-than-expected earnings helped prop up a solid dividend, which Oneok declared at 95.5 cents per common share back in April, and paid out in May. At the current rate the dividend payment annualizes to $3.82 per share, and gives a yield of 6.3%, contributing significantly to the stock’s return value.Turning to the insider activity, we find that the company’s President and CEO Pierce Norton recently bought 24,607 shares of OKE, for which he spent $1.5 million. It was by far the largest transaction conducted recently by a Oneok insider.All of this has caught the attention of Stifel analyst Selman Akyol, who is impressed by Oneok’s acquisition activity and its ability to emulate larger midstream firms.“We view the acquisition of Magellan as providing ONEOK with increased scale and diversity of assets while maintaining its Gulf Coast and Mid-Con concentric footprint. This will clearly make OKE more on par with Enterprise Products or Energy Transfer in terms of diversity across the carbon chain. Equally important, it provides OKE with immediate synergies totaling $200 million and potentially a runaway to harvest total synergies over $400 million over the next several years. OKE has had a desire to be able to export NGLs and we believe either through additional assets or potentially repurposing assets OKE may be much closer to achieving that given Magellan’s access to the water,” Akyol opined.These comments support the analyst’s Buy rating, while his $76 price target suggests that OKE will appreciate ~25% in the coming months. (To watch Akyol’s track record, click here)Overall, OKE has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 12 recent analyst reviews with a breakdown of 7 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock is currently trading at $60.94 and its average price target of $70.55 implies room for ~16% growth going forward. (See Oneok stock forecast)The Children’s Place (PLCE)Now we’ll shift gears and move from the energy industry to the realm of children’s retail, where we’ll explore the prominent player, Children’s Place.Notably, Children’s Place holds the position of being the largest children’s apparel retailer in the North American market. The company designs its own clothing lines for children from birth through toddlerhood to school age, and it contracts out the manufacturing of these designs. Additionally, the company controls both the retail and wholesale marketing and sales.Children’s Place sells its merchandise under several brand names, including the well-known eponymous Children’s Place label, Baby Place, and Gymboree, among others. At the end of the company’s first quarter – the end of this past April – Children’s Place was operating 599 stores across the US, including Puerto Rico, and Canada. On the international side, the company had five international franchise partners, controlling 212 distribution points in 15 countries.The economic turmoil of the past several years has been hard on Children’s Place, and the company’s stock is down 28% since the beginning of this year. Recent weeks have been better, however, and PLCE has joined the overall bullish trend – the stock has gained 81% from its June 1 trough.Turning to the financial results, we find that Children’s Place last report, for Q1 of fiscal 2023, ending on April 29, showed a top-line revenue figure of $321.64 million. This was down 11% year-over-year, and missed the estimates by $16.82 million. At the bottom line, earnings also missed the forecast, with the non-GAAP EPS of -$2.00 coming in 22 cents below expectations. The EPS figure was a poor comparison to the $1.05 EPS profit reported in 1Q22.Despite the financial misses, the CEO of Children’s Place, Jane Elfers, purchased 43,000 shares of the stock early this month. This was a significant insider buy, for which Elfers laid out $1.019 million. Her stake in the company now totals more than $8.8 million.She is not the only bull here, either. Jeff Lick, covering PLCE for B. Riley, sees Children’s Place as an undervalued growth opportunity, and recommends that investors buy in now. In his words, “We continue to like the fundamental, transformational story of PLCE. From a stock set-up perspective, we’d be remiss if we didn’t highlight the notion that it appears to us PLCE now has four consecutive quarters of low expectations, potentially explosive upside catalysts and seemingly easy compares.”“We do not mean to dismiss the effects that the current and prolonged economic headwinds can and has had on PLCE’s financial results. In our view, the company-specific, transformative elements to the PLCE story in conjunction with its proven cash flow generation and low valuation based on our 2024 estimates represent simply too meaningful of an outsized return potential together with a reasonable level of downside protection to pass up,” the analyst added.In addition to his Buy rating on the shares, Lick gives PLCE a $43 price target, implying a one-year gain of 64%. (To watch Lick’s track record, click here)Overall, Children’s Place stock gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 3 recent reviews that include 1 Buy to 2 Holds. The stock is selling for $26.22 and its average target price, at $30.67, suggests it will gain ~17% in the next 12 months.

233,0b9bf52b-f699-3083-be35-56fc83d4645b,MTB,2023-07-07,Is M&T Bank (MTB) a Potential Stock for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-mtb-potential-145400403.html,1688655240,STORY,['MTB'],"[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put M&amp;T Bank MTB stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, M&amp;T Bank has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.05, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 20.88. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, M&amp;T Bank’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 11.87) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.91. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that M&amp;T Bank has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 7.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Apple stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, M&amp;T Bank has a P/S ratio of about 2.1. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.87x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, M&amp;T Bank currently has a Value Score of , putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes M&amp;T Bank a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for M&amp;T Bank is just 0.75, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.28. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, MTB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though M&amp;T Bank might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives MTB a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year estimate has seen one up and four down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 4.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and ConsensusM&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and ConsensusM&amp;T Bank Corporation price-consensus-chart | M&amp;T Bank Corporation QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineM&amp;T Bank is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 14% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

234,310fc2fd-d1ba-3a85-98ee-7583c39bf5f4,MTB,2023-07-07,Investors in M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) have seen respectable returns of 45% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-m-t-bank-nyse-125353504.html,1688648033,STORY,['MTB'],"[Investors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) share price. It's up 32% over three years, but that is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 21% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, M&amp;T Bank achieved compound earnings per share growth of 2.8% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on M&amp;T Bank's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of M&amp;T Bank, it has a TSR of 45% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in M&amp;T Bank had a tough year, with a total loss of 18% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

With healthy fundamentals, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock appears to be a promising investment option at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth DriversEwing, NJ-based Universal Display is a leading developer of technology and intellectual property (IP) for the Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) market. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light. This can be manufactured on flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products.Universal Display is a dominant provider of OLED technology. The technology is likely to eventually replace LED and liquid crystal display (LCD) technologies due to energy efficiency, higher contrast ratio, better viewing angle, lower video response time and smaller form factor. These superior properties of OLED provide ample room for growth.Strong end-market demand also presents a significant growth opportunity for Universal Display over the long term. OLED is suitable for commercial usage in a number of industries, including smartphones, television, virtual reality devices and automotive markets. The increasing proliferation of smartphones, wearables and tablets is driving the adoption of small-area OLEDs. Large-area OLED displays are increasingly used in televisions. Further, unlike LEDs, OLEDs can be viewed directly and doesn’t need diffusers. It is also expected to be cost-effective when manufactured in high volumes, which makes it suitable for commercial application in the solid-state lighting market.Universal Display’s dominance in OLED technology is primarily driven by its strong portfolio of around 5,500 patents worldwide. The company’s UniversalPHOLED phosphorescent OLED technology produces OLEDs that are four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs. This provides Universal Display with a competitive advantage over other OLED makers.Moreover, collaborations with leading centers of excellence like the Princeton University, the University of Southern California, the University of Michigan and PPG Industries will continue to strengthen its patent portfolio in the long haul.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Much Debt Does Devon Energy Carry?As you can see below, Devon Energy had US$6.42b of debt, at March 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$761.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$5.66b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Devon Energy's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Devon Energy had liabilities of US$2.93b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$9.39b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$761.0m and US$1.62b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$9.94b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Devon Energy has a very large market capitalization of US$30.5b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Devon Energy has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.55. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 25.2 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, Devon Energy grew its EBIT by 80% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Devon Energy can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last two years, Devon Energy produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 55% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewThe good news is that Devon Energy's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And the good news does not stop there, as its EBIT growth rate also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Devon Energy's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Devon Energy (2 can't be ignored)  you should be aware of.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our analysis of the natural resources industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Buy. Despite the fact that technology is king these days, humankind is reaching for the stars, and an infinite amount of information is available in the palm of the hand, the simple fact is that natural resources are the dominant factor that has contributed to progress.The world's cars run on fossil fuels, computers, and gadgets rely on copper, minerals, and other natural resources, and construction relies on lumber to build a large number of buildings. And even though renewable energy is all the buzz these days, petroleum products are still the go to choice for generating electricity and running airplanes and cars. The world's infrastructure is dependent on natural resources, and at least for the near term future, they are here to stay.This need for natural resources became even clearer in 2022 in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are two integral suppliers of gas, commodities, and other agricultural products. A conflict between the two shook up global supply chains for these valuable products. These effects were felt especially in Europe which had come to rely on cheap Russian gas to keep inflation down and fuel economic growth. The sum of the invasion's effects on the stock market involved primarily the shares of energy companies soaring at a time when their technology peers tanked. This share price growth also reaped dividends in literal form for investors, with Bloomberg reporting that during the three weeks that ended in September 2022 alone, energy companies paid out a massive $16.4 billion in dividends to mark a 15% sequential growth over the second quarter.Yet, natural resources also confer countries a predetermined advantage, unlike say innovation, which can surface in any country if the right conditions are in place. This also leaves some countries better off than others, and this dominance remains stable over the course of the years unless dramatic new discoveries are made. Our research of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources confirms this fact, as some of the largest countries in the world are also the richest. The top three countries are Russia, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia, with each having copious amounts of minerals, gas, and oil.Story continuesBuilding on this, the natural resources industry is also quite lucrative. One important natural resource industry is the mining sector. Research shows that this sector was worth $1.84 trillion in 2021 and was slated to grow to $2 trillion in 2022 to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. As opposed to some industries where the growth rate slows down over the passage of time, the case is the opposite in the mining industry which is slated to exhibit a CAGR of 12.9% to be worth $3.36 trillion by 2026. Naturally, this makes mining companies quite lucrative, with BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Glencore being the top three most valuable mining companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Moving towards one of the most important industries in the world, namely the energy industry, shows that this sector is worth trillions of dollars. For instance, the crude oil market alone was worth $2.7 trillion last year and is slated to grow to $2.9 trillion by the end of this year. From then on until 2027, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to be worth $3.7 trillion by then. For more details on the energy industry, be sure to check out Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World.Some top energy companies that we have identified are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). Combining these with the top mining companies named above lets us see what's going on in the industry right now. For instance, Shell announced in March that in addition to fueling gasoline vehicles, it will now also power electric cars after having completed the acquisition of Volta Inc in the U.S. This provides Shell access to a network of 3,000 charging points all over America, in more than 30 states as well as providing it the potential to expand this network by adding another 3,400 charging points. Taking a look at mining, BHP took the lead on the artificial intelligence front, when it announced in May that it has teamed up with Microsoft to use artificial intelligence and machine learning at the world's largest copper mine in Chile. Through this, the mining giant aims to improve production, contractor performance, and copper recovery from the site.As to what's on the minds of the companies themselves, here's what the management of Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:Following these principles, we’ve successfully won and advanced many clean energy projects, of which I’d like to highlight just a few. The left side represents projects currently under construction. These are projects with executed contracts, fixed payments and incremental growth with predictable returns. With project CapEx of just under $2 billion, including the new OCI project in Texas, where Linde will supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen by capturing CO2 for underground sequestration through our partner, ExxonMobil. Currently, this project makes up the majority of clean energy projects in our backlog since most electrolyzer investments are designated for the merchant market and therefore, considered base CapEx. There are a few projects like the recently announced Evonik agreement that meet backlog criteria.But even here, we support local network and supply high-purity clean hydrogen to electronics and other industrial customers as well. Currently, we view these electrolysis — electrolyzer projects as modules in our local supply network for supply of merchant hydrogen. They’re often integrated into our existing hydrogen network, sometimes side by side leveraging the same storage and transportation infrastructure, helping optimize distribution costs. Furthermore, these projects leverage various electrolyzer technologies, including PEM and outline to provide the best fit to customer needs. Sale of Plug is another avenue for Linde to participate in growth opportunities, which may have different customer demands or which may not benefit from integration with our existing supply network.With these details in mind let's take a look at some great natural resources stocks, out of which the notable names are Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the pizza industry, click 5 Best Pizza Stocks To Buy Now. ResearchAndMarkets.com reported that in 2022, the worldwide pizza market was valued at $141.1 billion. According to the publisher's forecasts, the market is anticipated to reach $192.4 billion by 2028, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2028. The market is being driven by several key factors, including the wide adoption of westernized lifestyles leading to changes in dietary habits, the growing preference for ordering pizzas online through websites and mobile applications, and the introduction of healthier pizza varieties such as vegan, low-calorie, and gluten-free options. According to Future Market Insights, the global frozen pizza market is expected to experience notable growth in the coming years. By 2023, it is estimated to reach a value of more than $20,196 million, and by 2033, the market is projected to be valued at $35,994 million, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 6% between 2023 and 2033. In 2022, the United States already owned a significant share of 17.2% in the global frozen pizza market, and by 2033, it is expected to capture 79.5% of the market. Based on the ‘State of the Pizzeria Industry Report’ by Pizza Today, the majority of pizzeria operators expressed optimism or neutrality regarding their sales in 2023. The report thoroughly examined the state of pizzerias in America by conducting surveys with more than 750 owners representing all 50 states. Approximately 20.4% of the respondents anticipated that their gross annual sales would remain steady this year. Nearly 17.5% believed there would be a growth in sales ranging from 5% to 9%, while 16.2% predicted a sales increase between 1% and 4% in 2023. 10.6% of the respondents expected a notable growth of 10% to 15% in their sales. Only 22.2% of pizzeria operators were concerned that their sales in 2023 would not exceed those in 2022. 92.5% of the operators indicated that they would raise their prices in 2023 to compensate for increased cost of raw materials. After this adjustment, about one-third of the participants forecasted an increase in total profits this year. Technomic’s ‘Technomic Pizza Consumer Trend Report’ for 2022 indicated that 65% of surveyed consumers expressed that their pizza consumption will stay consistent in 2023. Additionally, 18% of the respondents mentioned that they expected a slight increase in their pizza consumption in 2023.Story continuesDon't Miss: 25 Largest Pizza Chains in the WorldAaron Allen &amp; Associates, global restaurant consultants based in Florida, highlighted some trends that the pizza industry is expected to encounter in the upcoming years. Firstly, the growth of the pizza industry in the US is predicted to be slower in contrast to the overall foodservice industry. While Food Away From Home sales have been rising at an average rate of 6.2% per annum over the past three years, the pizza segment is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. Secondly, as the pizza segment becomes more saturated, smaller chains may experience a decline in market share or be acquired by larger players. While certain pizzerias like Cicis and Sbarro might face challenges, prominent players like Domino's are expected to open new locations. Moreover, major industry players will introduce innovative methods of ordering, which will encourage independent operators to invest more in technology to gain a competitive edge. Pizza consumption is expected to remain steady, but there will be a consolidation trend, leading to weaker players being acquired. This presents an opportunity for private equity firms seeking to invest in restaurant concepts. Additionally, there is a growing demand for investors that can assist in reviving and enhancing mature brands that have not kept up with new trends.Individuals seeking investment opportunities in the restaurant industry can consider buying stocks such as Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), and The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC).Our Methodology While we primarily chose companies that make and deliver pizzas for this list, we also added a few firms which provide raw materials/ingredients for the pizza industry, including cheese, flour, and toppings.

We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

Nestlé benefits from a vast Total Addressable Market (TAM) available through developing and emerging market consumers shifting from subsistence economies to the introduction of market-based economies.

He’s doing it again before the sandwich chain’s $10 billion sale: ‘I have license to try anything and everything’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/subway-ceo-led-turnarounds-burger-100000985.html,1688724000,STORY,['MCD'],"[When John Chidsey took the reins of Subway in 2019, the sandwich store chain desperately needed a refresh. The company, led by the chain's founding family from 1965 until then, hadn't updated its menu or invested in technology in the decade before Chidsey's arrival.And it had lost ground to quick-service rivals like McDonald's and Panera. As a privately held company, Subway—the largest restaurant chain in the world by store count with 37,000 locations—is not required to disclose its financial results. But between 2015 and 2021, as business cratered, Subway closed 6,000 of its U.S. stores, almost one-quarter of them. The company has now resumed opening new ones. Four years ago, it tapped Chidsey, a turnaround artist who had fixed Burger King some years earlier as CEO, to work his magic again, with owners now eyeing a sale to private equity that reportedly could fetch $10 billion.""I use the words stale and static,"" says the 61-year-old, who came out of retirement after eight years to fix Subway. ""Both consumers and franchisees were screaming for more menu innovation.""Recent moves to modernize the menu include adding delicatessen-style items and offering new sandwich series made in a set way rather than the traditional do-it-yourself customizable manner customers are used to. On the corporate side, Chidsey has pushed for creating features that were shockingly absent at such a large company, like an equity compensation plan to attract top talent.His strategy, so far, is paying off, though that's not saying much, given the company's straits when he first joined. While sales per restaurant, excluding newly opened or closed ones, are close to where they were in 2012, they've risen in each of the last ten quarters. After years of decline, it's Subway's best streak in over a decade.This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: Subway is staging a big turnaround under your leadership. But why do consumers need Subway at all?With quick-service restaurants in general, people like convenience and speed. But what makes us unique is that in the world we live in today, we are the healthier option when you think that there is McDonald's everywhere, there's Burger King everywhere, there's KFC, there's Domino's. We don't necessarily have to be healthy. We just need to be healthier.Story continuesIt seems that Subway's restaurants and menu hadn't changed for years, and it was just a static business. Is that fair criticism?I use the word stale. There was a time when founder Fred DeLuca was ill for years and put his sister in charge. Between his illness and death and not having a succession plan, there was a period when there wasn't much menu innovation. When my team and I came in, we did our research. Both consumers and franchisees were screaming, 'We need more innovation.'Restaurant chains, notably Chipotle and McDonald's, have used tech and apps to spur sales and loyalty program adoption. But here, Subway feels way behind.We were behind even though we had all the money in the world, but the brand didn't choose to focus on digital. About three years ago, we started to focus on it. The nice thing was that we could look at what everybody else had done, see what worked, and take the best of it. Now digital sales have quadrupled as a percentage of total sales.Your restaurants are 100% franchisee-owned, even as Chipotle touts its flexibility because it owns all its restaurants and McDonald's tries to reset relations with its franchisees. What's the case for a franchisee model?If you look at public QSR companies, clearly, those that are more heavily franchised trade at higher multiples. Why? Because I think Wall Street likes that they generate so much free cash flow and are not capital-intensive businesses. There is no way we could have 37,000 restaurants and own them. I mean, the amount of capital and brainpower it would take.Your sales per restaurant are still close to 2012 levels. What will it take to lift them in a big way?Sales can get a lot bigger. We can double or triple our digital business again. And catering. I have no idea why Subway never built a big catering business because our food is extremely portable, unlike a soggy burger and fries.Subway's restaurants are notoriously ubiquitous partly because they are so small compared to other QSR chains. Could you see room for some larger restaurants to offer more of a dining experience?The beauty of Subway is that to run a Subway, literally, all you need is electricity and water. There are no fryers, no broilers, no grease traps or hoods. So you can fit one in Jakarta or downtown Tokyo, where you could never have fit a McDonald's or a Burger King. That's an advantage. But the flip side is that, yes, they need to be small. Remodeling the rest of the U.S. restaurants is a huge necessity and opportunity; some will focus on dining in and some on picking up orders.You're leading a turnaround at Subway, and earlier in your career, you revamped brands like Burger King and Avis, the rental car agency. What do you like about turnarounds?It's just more fun. You can make a bunch of decisions, and if it fails, I really can't be wrong because it was clearly screwed up in the first place. So I have license to try anything and everything with a lot of urgency. I like that much better than, 'Oh, you screwed up something that was running really, really well.'Part of Subway's challenges came from being a family-owned company that, despite its size, didn't follow all the usual corporate governance practices. What did you do to remedy that?We put in a much more professional management team and created a board with independent directors. Shareholders clearly own the company, but we have board members with lots of different experiences, so the owners are hearing not just from us but from people with other retail and restaurant experience.You also had to make Subway competitive in the job market. What did you do to achieve that?The founder had some interesting rules, like not having an equity program. They didn't even pay bonuses until Fred, the founder, passed, and the biggest bonus paid was 5% of your salary. So you can imagine you couldn't get somebody to leave McDonald's or leave Hertz to come here. At the same time, some people have been here for decades. That's usually not a good thing because new ideas are not coming in. So things were kind of ossified and patriarchal for a long time.Get to know Chidsey:Chidsey is the first CEO in Subway's 58-year history who's not a founding family member.He held senior finance roles at worked at PepsiCo earlier in his career.He is a chartered public accountant and lawyer by training.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

""Now, I only bring five kilos.""Story continuesAs Indians cut back on tomatoes, some businesses suggest alternatives.""Tomato prices running high?

And as usual, big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup will kick off the busy quarter next week.But Wall Street's biggest banks might be facing tighter profit margins following the aftermath of the banking crisis and collapse of Silicon Valley Bank back in March.Now some analysts are painting a gloomy picture for this quarter, saying Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. Michele Schneider, MarketGauge.com Chief Strategist is still here with us. So Michele, do you agree with that assessment?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, if we look at what had boosted the bank earnings in the past, a lot of it was from their financial side, right? From people-- from people being involved in investments and that liquidity that it added to banks.And also being able to borrow money, which right now is much more difficult that these higher interest rates. And even though the housing market has been strong, obviously mortgage applications have been impacted by rising rates.So yeah, at this point, I would think that for this quarter, we will not necessarily see very strong bank earnings. And you mentioned the banking crisis. I mean, some people feel that it was just a little bit too soon in terms of saying crisis over. I mean, what did it last? Like about four days.And so the higher the interest rates go, that could put a lot of squeeze particularly on the commercial real estate and the regional bank side. So I would not have great high expectations at this point.BRAD SMITH: Do you think there's a theme that emerges this earnings season? It seemed like last earnings season, it was all about how can we say AI in various amount of ways for companies who had no business saying it in some of them. So Michele, is there one theme that you believe will emerge this earnings season?Story continuesMICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, again, I think that you have-- the advantage is going to be to any of these companies that have managed to survive throughout the first six months because of their operating cash flow. And that has given them some level of growth.And that's why you have to mention AI, right? Because that certainly has happened there. So that's kind of what I would continue to look at. I mean, just take Nike in terms of the consumer space, right? Earnings not great and Nike stock has been falling.So if that's any kind of foreshadowing, that means that we will see a lot of stress in terms of the earnings. And it's going to be, of course, what they say about future as we get through the rest of the year.And at this point, right now, with the expectations of two more interest rate hikes and as we've talked about already, inflation not necessarily being in control, at least in the places that affect consumers the worst, yeah, I would think that we'll see AI probably still do well.Apple, all these companies as they continue to compete with one another. But a lot of the other companies not necessarily doing so great.DIANE KING HALL: So can you name more of those companies, besides Nike, that where you expect to see some stress. Would these be consumer company-- consumer-facing companies or where are you expecting to see this stress?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, we started with banks so I think the banks can set the tone for sure. And if they do not come in great or worse than expected, right?I mean, the thing with earnings seasons, first of all, is that it's always looking backwards and it's really about what the actual number is versus the expectation that has the greatest impact to the market. And even that is, sometimes, a short-term impact. So the longer term impact generally is what they project going forward, the guidance.And so, yeah, I mean-- I mean, like, let's take some of the high flyers in terms of the consumer space that we've seen in the past, Lululemon being one. I think that those kind of companies could actually start to feel the strain.Whereas some of the fast food companies that had had stress could actually start to come back a little bit. You know, like a McDonald's, for example.So I think that that's really-- you have to think what's going to be if everything we've just talked about, Diane, turns out to be true. If the market has seen a top. If the yields are going to have to be stretched. If we are going to enter more stagflation, potentially recession as we get into 2024.Where are these company-- where are people are going to spend their money? And they're going to spend the money on more of the staples, which did terribly, right? I mean Target, of course, had its own reasons for doing that outside of being Staples, which went down against discretionary. But that could rebound.A company like Walmart could continue to do well. You know, where people are going to go and buy cheapest goods they can get at this point.BRAD SMITH: Michele, just lastly while we're on this topic. One of my favorite conversations to kick off the earnings season is with Delta's executives.Because it gives us a sense of where this counter-cyclical recovery that we've heard about from travel companies is continuing or what type of consumer profile they're continuing to engage with.Particularly across services spending right now in the experience economy, are you expecting for there to be any slowdown within that?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, it's such a good question, Brad, because we actually were in the cruise line stocks and had taken some profits along the way.And I've talked to people who do go on a lot of cruises. They said they're booked out for at least the next year. And so again, at this point, that still could be an outperforming area as people seem to be cutting back in certain things but yet wanting to get out, wanting to get away, wanting to go on a cruise, wanting to get on a plane.Do I think that can be impacted? Of course. As we know, when things get sour, if they go sour, it's really hard for anything, particularly in this more sort of discretionary area, to sustain.And then we have this other kind of crazy thing going on which is the possibility of labor unrest as wages continue to have to increase to keep up. And you know, you had a strike right now in UPS and I think it's still out there. And there's been threats of airline strikes.So I think I wouldn't necessarily be all that overly optimistic anywhere when it comes to the equity space, even in the airlines and the cruise lines.DIANE KING HALL: Interesting. So maybe some caution ahead. All right, Michele Schneider, thank you so much. We appreciate you for joining us today. Michele Schneider, MarketGauge.com Chief Strategist.MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Thank you.]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market, market indexes, and recent developments, head on over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today. The U.S. economy finally appears to be stabilizing. Throughout 2023, worries of a recession have plagued investor minds as many worried that the Federal Reserve had gone too far in its interest rate hikes. However, June dealt markets a nice surprise as the Commerce Department upgraded its estimates for the first quarter of 2023's GDP growth. This third revision showed that the economy had posted an annual growth rate of 2% in Q1 2023, up by 70 basis points (0.7%) from the previous estimates.This data came as two and a half days of trading were left before the 4th of July holiday, and after opening at 13,592 on the day of the release, the NASDAQ Composite index closed at 13,816 the day before the holiday to pocket a modest 1.6% growth. The effect of this release was also reflected in the currency markets, with the U.S. dollar tumbling against major currencies as investors readjusted their sentiments of potential interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.Crucially though, 2023's first half has proven to be remarkable for the stock market. The NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ 100 are up by 33% and 40% this year (its best first half performance in history) - quite different from what many investors were expecting heading into this year riding on the back of high interest rates and high inflation. The two NASDAQs are also among the best performing indexes this year, as the S&amp;P500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained 16.51% and 3.87%, respectively.The NASDAQ also ranks second on the list of the world's biggest stock exchanges. As of January 2023, the total market capitalization of all firms listed on it stood at $18 trillion - surpassed only by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) which had a market capitalization of $22 trillion. This value is greater than the world's third and fourth biggest stock exchanges, namely the Euronext N.V. exchanges and the Japan Exchange Group Exchanges.Story continuesYet, even as the stock market appears to be robust, the debate has already started about a bigger market - the bond market. The apparent simmering upshoots of negativity in the bond market came to the forefront on the same day that Commerce upgraded its GDP estimates. In an opinion piece, former New York Federal Reserve president Bill Dudley claimed that the yields on 10 year U.S. bonds will shoot up to 4.5% - up from the roughly 3.75% right now. He explained that due to the tight labor market, persistent inflation, and robust economy, the Fed might be forced to maintain high interest rates for longer. He also added that the Fed is also forced to ensure that inflation remains around 2% since if it falls too much then its utility to stimulate economic growth also falls. Finally, he factored in the reduced demand for U.S. government treasuries to indicate that the risk premium investors demand for these bonds will go up. Putting all these together, he arrived at a 4.5% yield estimate - and one that has generated quite a bit of controversy.Leading the charge against the former Fed official with years of experience in investment banking, are analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). They believe that instead of the yields shooting up to 4.5% (which indicates a sharp decrease in the bond price and creates an incentive for existing bondholders to sell their instruments), the yields will actually drop to 2% and 3% from the current 3.85%. They also countered the components of Mr. Dudley's 4.5% estimate, namely the one involving 1% short term interest rates. The Morgan Stanley analysts believe that short term rates can increase to a maximum 0.5%, with average inflation expected to sit at 2% instead of 2.5% over the long term as assumed by Dudley.But what if both stocks and bonds were headed for a downturn this year? Well, that's what's on the mind of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associate's co-chief investment officer Mr. Greg Jensen, who outlined in a recent podcast:My view is you end up with growth disappointing a bit and inflation disappointing on the high side a bit, ending up probably bad for bonds and probably a little bit bad for equities and generally weak growth. And if that weak growth starts to translate into a rising savings rate, you could easily end up in a recession and one that’s going to be difficult to deal with. I’ve tamed and we’ve tamed at Bridgewater, to some degree, our view on growth. While still negative, [IT'S] not as extreme as it appeared and it’s a more gradual process that’s unfolding.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top NASDAQ stocks that might be interesting to look at. Out of these, the notable picks are DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:WSC).15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy TodayPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best NASDAQ stocks, we first started by compiling a list of the biggest companies on the exchange in terms of market capitalization. However, this naturally biases the list in favor of mega cap stocks, leaving little utility to our list of top NASDAQ stocks. So, we filtered the list by including only those firms that were rated Hold or better. While choosing stocks rated Hold sounds counterintuitive, it provides a better contrast between analyst sentiment and hedge fund sentiment since some Hold stocks might have more investors than Buy stocks. The list was narrowed down to stocks with a market capitalization greater than $2 billion. These were ranked by analyst sentiment. Out of the top forty stocks in the list, the ones with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2023 were chosen for our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy.15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today15.

(NYSE:UPS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and President of International, Kathleen Gutmann, sold US$10m worth of shares at a price of US$190 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$179. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).United Parcel Service insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of United Parcel ServiceFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. United Parcel Service insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$114m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no United Parcel Service insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of United Parcel Service insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)FedEx Corp. advised shippers on Thursday that they should begin shipping now with the company if they are concerned about service disruptions arising from a possible Teamsters union strike Aug. 1 of UPS Inc.In a communique Thursday, FedEx (NYSE: FDX) said that the company’s priority is “protecting capacity and service for existing customers.” Customers considering shifting volumes to FedEx, or currently in discussions with the company to open a new account, are “encouraged to begin shipping with FedEx now,” the communique said.FedEx has said that while it has held productive discussions with UPS (NYSE: UPS) customers, it has yet to see any tangible bump in business as a result of shipper uncertainty over the situation.On Wednesday, UPS and the Teamsters broke off negotiations over a new master contract, with each side blaming the other for the breakdown. There are no new talks scheduled. The Teamsters have threatened to strike if a contract is not in hand by Aug.1, the day after the current contract expires.In an email sent Thursday to the company’s global sales and pricing teams, FedEx said that pricing offers with large customers must be signed on or before July 17 or the offer will be withdrawn. The company will honor commitments to large customers who plan to onboard after July 17.The company will bring on new small to midsize customers as it assesses network capacity. Third parties should shift business immediately as volume shipped during the week of July 17-21 will determine how much capacity will be allocated to them, FedEx said.Separately, Mike Parra, CEO of the Americas for DHL Express, the international air express unit of DHL, said Thursday that his company hasn’t benefited from shipper concern over a strike. Parra also told FreightWaves at an Atlanta event that he doesn’t want to see a strike, and that a work stoppage would lead to a “total disruption” of the U.S. economy.“There isn’t a single company on the planet that can handle 24 million shipments a day that UPS manages,” Parra said, a reference to UPS’ total daily volumes mentioned in some publications. A work stoppage would also “impact our employees, and that’s not a good thing,” Parra said.Story continues“This is not the way to earn business,” Parra said about the back and forth. “You want to earn the business the right way.”Parra was at DHL in 1997 when the Teamsters struck UPS for 15 days. “It was horrific,” he said. “We got flooded with volume, and on Day 16 all of that business went back to UPS. It impacted our loyal customers that have been there with us,” he said.The post FedEx advises UPS shippers to get on board now appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan breaks down the economic impact of the potential strike.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFFO: A UPS driver strike is looming after labor negotiations collapsed on Wednesday. The negotiations stalled on new labor contracts and the slowdown of talks is raising the risk that more than 300,000 package delivery drivers and sorters will go on strike early next month. So what's at stake? Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan to give us the details. Hey, Alexis.ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Rachelle. Yeah, so according to UPS, these fractured negotiations with the Teamsters Union that represents these workers over this new collective bargaining agreement that would be good for five years, they say it's a threat to the entire US economy. Now, the company's union workers, they include those who sort and deliver packages. And as you mentioned, 300,000-plus of these workers have already authorized a strike if there's no contract by the deadline of July 31.Now, I've been trying to get my arms around both the potential for a strike, as well as the impact of these 340,000, let's say, workers not doing their jobs. Now, as for the economy and the supply chain concerns, UPS handles a total of 18.7 million domestic packages each day and 24.3 million package on a global basis. And in 2022, those numbers really dominated the parcel delivery market by revenue, as well as market share. The company held 37% market share in that year compared to FedEx with 33%, followed by UPS at 16% and Amazon Logistics at 12%.Now, as for the weight of the union's threat of a strike, it's worth looking at the union's labor dispute that's been ongoing with the US's third-largest trucking company, and that's Yellow. And the company's been looking to modify its collective bargaining agreement with 22,000 workers. So a lot fewer workers, they're a smaller company. But its management in June had said that it could be out of money by August, and that's why they were looking to renegotiate their contracts looking at a possible need to file bankruptcy there. But take a listen to how the Teamsters' general president, Sean O'Brien, responded to that threat coming from Yellow.Story continuesSEAN O'BRIEN: It is not left for the Teamsters to save this company-- we have given enough. What happens next is out of our control.- So O'Brien seemingly willing to jeopardize at least 22,000 union jobs there. And while Yellow is a smaller company than UPS with many fewer workers, it may be kind of a telltale sign of how unions have gained some power in these last few years and the uptick in union activity during the COVID-19 pandemic that seems to have carried forward to today, also looking at a tight labor market here as we speak that could give union a possibly an edge here.But as of now, these negotiations are stalled, both sides saying that each other has walked away from the bargaining table and shares deteriorating on that news on Wednesday and still have not popped back up since their close-- on Monday was at about $183 a share. Now, looking-- hovering around $177 I last checked.- Well, certainly. Thank you for getting us up to speed on that. I know you'll be following that story for us. Our very own Alexis Keenan there.]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.

SL Green (SLG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 19, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.36 a share.SL Green's Earnings ESP sits at 1.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.36 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34.SLG is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs.

DUK recently announced its decision to divest its commercial distributed generation (DG) business to an affiliate of private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners in a $364 million deal. The transaction is expected to reach completion by the end of 2023 and will generate about $259 million of proceeds for DUK.The business includes distributed fuel cell projects managed by Bloom Energy, REC Solar’s operating assets, development pipeline and O&amp;M portfolio.Rationale Behind the SaleThe latest sale agreement preceded Duke Energy’s commitment to selling its utility-scale renewables business platform, announced last month. The company expects to receive proceeds from both these divestments by the end of 2023, which are aimed at bolstering DUK’s balance sheet. It also plans to use gains from these sale-outs to avoid holding any additional debt associated with these two assets.Further, the company aims to utilize these sale proceeds to upgrade its grid reliability and integrate more than 30,000 megawatts of regulated renewable energy into its system by 2035.As part of its clean energy portfolio expansion strategy, Duke Energy currently operates 1,200 MW of solar in Florida, with plans to continue adding approximately 300 MW a year going forward. We expect the proceeds from the aforementioned divestments to play a vital role in enabling DUK to duly achieve the clean energy target.Peer MovesElectric utilities in the United States are rapidly shifting their focus away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources to meet climate goals. Like Duke Energy, other utilities that have recently made divestments to fund their clean energy promotion are FirstEnergy Corp. FE, Consolidated Edison Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 5.8% over 2022’s reported figure.Consolidated Edison completed the sale of its clean energy business to RWE Renewables America, LLC, in March 2023, for $6.8 billion. The sale proceeds from this divestment should aid ED in making significant investments in clean energy transmission projects, building electrification, energy efficiency, electric vehicle infrastructure and battery storage.ED’s long-term earnings growth rate is 2%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 9.51%.  In June 2023, NiSource signed an agreement to sell 19.9% of its equity stake in NIPSCO, Indiana's largest vertically integrated electric and gas distribution company, to Blockstone Inc.’s infrastructure group for $2.15 billion.

282,2cb349f5-147a-3e81-8275-7fe847bece0c,ZBH,2023-07-07,Abbott (ABT) Gets FDA Approval for AVEIR DR Leadless Pacemaker,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-abt-gets-fda-approval-124600991.html,1688647560,STORY,"['HAE', 'ABT', 'ZBH']","[Abbott ABT recently received FDA approval for its pioneering AVEIR dual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker system. The approval comes following the recent late-breaking clinical trial data showing that the system is safe and effective for treating abnormal heart rhythms.The latest development significantly increases access to leadless pacing for millions of people across the United States.Significance of AVEIR DR DevicesThe AVEIR DR leadless pacing system is made up of two devices — the previously approved AVEIR VR single-chamber device, which paces the right ventricle, and the recently approved AVEIR AR single-chamber device, which paces the right atrium. Smaller than the AAA battery, each AVEIR pacemaker is implanted via a minimally invasive procedure.AVEIR DR devices provide synchronized or coordinated cardiac pacing between two leadless pacemakers based on the person's clinical needs using Abbott's novel i2i (implant-to-implant) technology. The breakthrough technology utilizes high-frequency pulses to relay messages via the naturally conductive characteristics of the body's blood between each leadless pacemaker.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEach implant communicates beat-to-beat with a paired, co-implanted device to support dual-chamber therapy. This conductive communication is critical because it uses far less battery current than inductive, radio frequency or Bluetooth communication.AVEIR leadless pacemakers are designed for retrieval, which will help if therapy needs to be changed or the device needs to be replaced in the future.News in DetailWith more than 80% of people requiring pacing in both the right atrium and the right ventricle, the currently available leadless pacing options have been limited to single-chamber ventricular devices. This stems from the significant engineering challenge of seamless, wireless synchronization of two leadless pacemakers.The AVEIR DR system, which is roughly one-tenth the size of a traditional pacemaker, is also designed to provide real-time pacing analysis. This enables physicians to assess the proper placement of the device during the procedure and before implanting the device inside the heart chamber.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global leadless cardiac pacemaker market is expected to witness a CAGR of 17.2% by 2028.Recent DevelopmentsIn June, Abbott announced a collaboration with the American Diabetes Association, to gain a deeper understanding of the role of Continuous Glucose Monitoring systems in personalized therapeutic nutrition for people with diabetes.During the same month, ABT’s FreeStyle Libre 2 system became the first and only CGM system to be nationally reimbursed in France for people who use basal insulin.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Abbott shares have decreased 4.2% against the industry’s rise of 3.2%.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksAbbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Haemonetics HAE, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and SiBone SIBN.

The Australian liquefied natural gas sector and Gulf of Mexico deep-water production present lucrative opportunities for the company.A prominent oil and gas industry player, Chevron has expressed its anticipation of a surge in activity within the Permian and DJ basins. This optimistic outlook will serve as a catalyst for the company’s ongoing expansion efforts.The Permian Basin, located primarily in Texas and New Mexico, is renowned as one of the most prolific oil and gas regions in the United States.

While its electrical business spun off as nVent in 2018, Pentair remains a promising player in the market.Demonstrating an unwavering commitment to value investing, the company has achieved the impressive feat of raising its dividend for 47 consecutive years. This exceptional track record has solidified Pentair as a stock worth pursuing.Pentair’s dividend of $0.88 per share is well-covered and reinforced by projected earnings per share ranging from $3.60 to $3.70 in 2023. This solid financial foundation showcases the company’s stability and potential for investors seeking stocks to buy now.Admittedly, Pentair faces headwinds primarily due to declining sales within its core pool equipment segment. The company experienced a surge during the pandemic lockdowns as customers invested in their homes. However, a natural correction in demand and rising interest rates have pressured spending, impacting Pentair’s pool revenue expectations.Nevertheless, CEO John Stauch remains optimistic. He highlights the company’s ongoing transformation initiative aimed at cost-cutting and increasing returns on sales. With strength in its non-residential businesses, such as fluid treatment and commercial water solutions, Pentair has ambitious goals.The company has set its sights on achieving a return on sales of approximately 23% by 2025, a notable increase from the reported 18.6% return on sales in 2022.If Pentair achieves its targets and its residential business recovers, investors can anticipate continued dividend growth. The company’s focus on non-residential sectors and cost optimization positions it for long-term success, making it an enticing prospect among hidden gems in the stock market.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To skip the detailed analysis of the natural gas industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now.Natural gas is one of the most used energy sources in the world. In the US alone, it accounted for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021, and in the electricity sector, it accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production.In 2022, fuel prices including natural gas peaked due to the Russia-Ukraine war which led to sanctions on Russia, resulting in pressure on European and global gas markets. However, due to favorable weather conditions and actions taken by the governments, the pressure on the market eased a little since the beginning of 2023. In Europe, natural gas consumption fell by almost 55 billion cubic meters year-over-year during the 2022/2023 heating season, marking the steepest decline in consumption for any recorded winter season. Furthermore, to avoid further pressures due to the cut-off from Russian exports, the European Union has also unveiled a 210 billion euro plan to completely be rid of Russian fossil fuel dependence by 2027. Compared to 2022, the Russian pipeline gas consumption is expected to drop around 45% in 2023. Nevertheless, In Asia and the Middle East, the natural gas demand is expected to increase by 3% and 2%, respectively, The higher demand from these regions will offset most of the drop in demand from Europe and the US in 2023 which is expected to decline by 5% and 2%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2023, the natural gas average price at Henry Hub was $2.55 per Metric Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), which showed an almost 40% YoY decline and a 57% sequential decline. The natural gas price was $4.55 per MMBtu in Q1 2022 and $5.92 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2022. Between mid-December and the first quarter of 2023, natural gas prices dropped by around 70% in Northeast Asian, North American, and European markets.Story continuesThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its short-term energy outlook on June 6 which reveals that the US natural gas production set a monthly record in April with 104 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) production. In the previous month, it was 102 billion cubic feet per day. The EIA expects natural gas production to average around 103 Bcfd in the second half of 2023. According to the EIA’s outlook, natural gas prices are expected to remain conservative in the second half of the year too with an estimated $2.60 per MMBtu average price in the third quarter of 2023. One of the main reasons for these low prices is overstocked inventory. In May, natural gas storage inventories were 15% above the 5-year average.Despite having a rough time, natural gas prices can still increase over time as it has been a key source of fuel in reducing global carbon emissions. On top of that, if a dry or hotter-than-usual summer comes along and gets followed by a cold winter, the commodity can experience high price volatility. On June 26, natural gas futures to their peak in two months and have since dropped by 6.8% on June 30.Even though natural gas prices are under pressure due to several factors, the commodity is still expected to play a huge role in the energy industry until renewable energy completely takes over fossil fuels. Due to low prices, natural gas stocks are also experiencing a decline in their stock prices. To take advantage of the situation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best stocks to look out for.10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Nowvovan/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we chose the natural gas companies according to their hedge fund sentiment as of the first quarter of 2022.

If you want to skip our analysis of the natural resources industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Buy. Despite the fact that technology is king these days, humankind is reaching for the stars, and an infinite amount of information is available in the palm of the hand, the simple fact is that natural resources are the dominant factor that has contributed to progress.The world's cars run on fossil fuels, computers, and gadgets rely on copper, minerals, and other natural resources, and construction relies on lumber to build a large number of buildings. And even though renewable energy is all the buzz these days, petroleum products are still the go to choice for generating electricity and running airplanes and cars. The world's infrastructure is dependent on natural resources, and at least for the near term future, they are here to stay.This need for natural resources became even clearer in 2022 in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are two integral suppliers of gas, commodities, and other agricultural products. A conflict between the two shook up global supply chains for these valuable products. These effects were felt especially in Europe which had come to rely on cheap Russian gas to keep inflation down and fuel economic growth. The sum of the invasion's effects on the stock market involved primarily the shares of energy companies soaring at a time when their technology peers tanked. This share price growth also reaped dividends in literal form for investors, with Bloomberg reporting that during the three weeks that ended in September 2022 alone, energy companies paid out a massive $16.4 billion in dividends to mark a 15% sequential growth over the second quarter.Yet, natural resources also confer countries a predetermined advantage, unlike say innovation, which can surface in any country if the right conditions are in place. This also leaves some countries better off than others, and this dominance remains stable over the course of the years unless dramatic new discoveries are made. Our research of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources confirms this fact, as some of the largest countries in the world are also the richest. The top three countries are Russia, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia, with each having copious amounts of minerals, gas, and oil.Story continuesBuilding on this, the natural resources industry is also quite lucrative. One important natural resource industry is the mining sector. Research shows that this sector was worth $1.84 trillion in 2021 and was slated to grow to $2 trillion in 2022 to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. As opposed to some industries where the growth rate slows down over the passage of time, the case is the opposite in the mining industry which is slated to exhibit a CAGR of 12.9% to be worth $3.36 trillion by 2026. Naturally, this makes mining companies quite lucrative, with BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Glencore being the top three most valuable mining companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Moving towards one of the most important industries in the world, namely the energy industry, shows that this sector is worth trillions of dollars. For instance, the crude oil market alone was worth $2.7 trillion last year and is slated to grow to $2.9 trillion by the end of this year. From then on until 2027, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to be worth $3.7 trillion by then. For more details on the energy industry, be sure to check out Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World.Some top energy companies that we have identified are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). Combining these with the top mining companies named above lets us see what's going on in the industry right now. For instance, Shell announced in March that in addition to fueling gasoline vehicles, it will now also power electric cars after having completed the acquisition of Volta Inc in the U.S. This provides Shell access to a network of 3,000 charging points all over America, in more than 30 states as well as providing it the potential to expand this network by adding another 3,400 charging points. Taking a look at mining, BHP took the lead on the artificial intelligence front, when it announced in May that it has teamed up with Microsoft to use artificial intelligence and machine learning at the world's largest copper mine in Chile. Through this, the mining giant aims to improve production, contractor performance, and copper recovery from the site.As to what's on the minds of the companies themselves, here's what the management of Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:Following these principles, we’ve successfully won and advanced many clean energy projects, of which I’d like to highlight just a few. The left side represents projects currently under construction. These are projects with executed contracts, fixed payments and incremental growth with predictable returns. With project CapEx of just under $2 billion, including the new OCI project in Texas, where Linde will supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen by capturing CO2 for underground sequestration through our partner, ExxonMobil. Currently, this project makes up the majority of clean energy projects in our backlog since most electrolyzer investments are designated for the merchant market and therefore, considered base CapEx. There are a few projects like the recently announced Evonik agreement that meet backlog criteria.But even here, we support local network and supply high-purity clean hydrogen to electronics and other industrial customers as well. Currently, we view these electrolysis — electrolyzer projects as modules in our local supply network for supply of merchant hydrogen. They’re often integrated into our existing hydrogen network, sometimes side by side leveraging the same storage and transportation infrastructure, helping optimize distribution costs. Furthermore, these projects leverage various electrolyzer technologies, including PEM and outline to provide the best fit to customer needs. Sale of Plug is another avenue for Linde to participate in growth opportunities, which may have different customer demands or which may not benefit from integration with our existing supply network.With these details in mind let's take a look at some great natural resources stocks, out of which the notable names are Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).12 Best Natural Resources Stocks to BuyOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best natural resources stocks to buy based on hedge fund sentiment, we first narrowed down the top mining, forestry, and oil companies by market capitalization.

AMN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad array of services. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its healthcare Managed Services Program (“MSP”) are expected to contribute further. However, healthcare industry regulations and stiff competition are major downsides.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 2.2% compared with the 16.9% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 13.8% growth in the said time frame.The renowned player in the healthcare total talent services space has a market capitalization of $4.29 billion. The company projects 3.3% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. AMN Healthcare surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 10.5%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Array of Services: We are optimistic about AMN Healthcare’s business’ gradual evolution beyond traditional healthcare staffing. The company has become a strategic total talent solutions partner for its clients. Its suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes MSPs, vendor management systems and medical language interpretation services.On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, management confirmed that the company is continuing to elevate AMN Passport to be a digital staffing solution for all healthcare jobseekers at any stage of their careers across all businesses of AMN Healthcare.Healthcare MSP: AMN Healthcare’s unique MSP is helping the company gain market traction. Notably, the program helps streamline the entire workforce planning process, which facilitates the delivery of improved patient care. This has resulted in a large network of improved patient care and efficiency.In 2022, AMN Healthcare had approximately $5.3 billion in spend under management through its MSPs, and approximately 64% of its consolidated revenues flowed through MSP relationships.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Per management, the Technology and Workforce Solutions and Physician and Leadership Solutions segments exceeded expectations in the first quarter of 2023. The continued strength in AMN Healthcare’s Language Services also looks promising. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well.DownsidesHealthcare Industry Regulations: AMN Healthcare provides talent solutions and technologies on a contractual basis to its clients who pay the company directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact the company. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for AMN’s services.Stiff Competition: AMN Healthcare faces significant competition in the Medical Services industry. The company competes in national, regional and local markets for healthcare organization clients and healthcare professionals. In the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business, it competes with a few national competitors, along with numerous smaller, regional and local companies.Estimate TrendAMN Healthcare has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 0.8% north to $8.35.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $987.9 million, suggesting a 30.8% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

The award has been offered by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT.Details of the DealValued at $57.4 million, the contract is projected to get completed by Dec 31, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide F-16 Peace Carpathian M6.6 Operational Flight Program and System upgrade.The contract will serve the Romania Air Force. The work related to this deal will be performed at Fort Worth, TX; Greenville, SC; and Romania.Importance of F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products.  Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio.It is imperative to mention here that F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years. The F-16 has witnessed significant development in the last couple of years, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.To make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previous F-16 version. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals.Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products, including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.72% during the 2023-2028 period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense.

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-waste-management-110209538.html,1688727729,STORY,['WM'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Waste Management is US$151 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$171 share price, Waste Management appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for WM is US$175, which is 16% above our fair value estimateHow far off is Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.42bUS$3.02bUS$3.45bUS$3.68bUS$3.86bUS$4.02bUS$4.16bUS$4.29bUS$4.41bUS$4.52bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.47%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$2.2kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$79bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$37bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$61b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$171, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.981. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Waste ManagementStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

However, pricing pressure remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 21.6% compared with the industry’s 3.6% growth so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 16.9% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $112.89 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 9.4% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.4% compares favorably with the industry’s (3.1%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Stryker’s Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book amid recovery in procedure-demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the platform’s unique and promising features. These developments, in turn, enable the company to sustain the momentum in robotic-treatment sales.SYK is committed to the continued expansion of Mako, whose installations touched record high during the fourth quarter. It remains confident about robust growth in Mako revenues in 2023, on the back of new launches and software upgrades. The first-quarter results reflected Stryker’s efforts to promote the advanced surgery platform.The company is focused on continued expansion of Mako and progressing well with it in international markets. The initiatives reflect the demand for Stryker’s unique arm-assisted robotic technology.SYK also boasts a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products protects it against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil.Stryker’s significant exposure to robotics and artificial intelligence for healthcare and Medical Mechatronics have helped it to stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. The company’s portfolio includes Mako as well as products for hip and knee surgeries.Story continuesOn its first-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely affected last year due to COVID-19. Although hospital staffing pressure remains in certain regions, the company expects this problem to resolve gradually. This improvement, in turn, will likely lead to higher procedures in 2023.Per management, Stryker’s constant support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the effect of the pandemic subsides. In first-quarter 2023, its adjusted research and development expenses were 6.5% of net sales, highlighting its strong commitment to innovation. According to the company, this is likely to drive new product launches.In September 2022, SYK launched a new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System — for spine application. The Q Guidance system has shown promising launch uptake during the first quarter.Moreover, Stryker’s cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins and lessen inflationary pressure look promising. The adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses during first-quarter 2023 were 35.6% of net sales, expanding 40 basis points year over year.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable currency rate fluctuation poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. Foreign currency had a 2.2% unfavorable impact on sales during the first quarter. The trend is likely to continue in the second half of 2023. The company is also facing inflationary pressure, leading to lower margins.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $10.16, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.8%. The same for revenues is pinned at $19.95 billion, implying an 8.1% improvement year over year.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Alcon ALC, DexCom DXCM and Hologic HOLX, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

And increasing the odds of success by making sure the sustainability of a trend isn't easy.Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.Our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.VeriSign (VRSN) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for ""trend"" investors.A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. VRSN is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 4.6% over this period.However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 0.7% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this internet infrastructure services provider.Moreover, VRSN is currently trading at 88% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.Story continuesLooking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.So, the price trend in VRSN may not reverse anytime soon.In addition to VRSN, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

LYB has completed the acquisition of Mepol Group, a maker of recycled, high-performance specialized compounds based in Italy and Poland. Mepol S.r.l., as well as its subsidiaries Polar S.r.l. and Industrial Technology Investments Poland Sp.z.o.o., will join LyondellBasell's Advanced Polymer Solutions (“APS”) business unit.The APS division is a global leader in compounding solutions, producing and marketing polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics, masterbatches, engineered composites, colors and powders. The company envisions a substantial opportunity to drive the expansion of its APS business by leveraging macro trends in circularity and developing solutions for daily sustainable living, owing to Mepol's strong knowledge of recycled compounds and its strategy and scale.Through its integrated value chain strategy, LyondellBasell is establishing a leading position to respond to the rapidly expanding need for circular and renewable solutions. To meet the requirements of its clients, the company pledges to produce and sell no less than 2 million metric tons of polymers from recycled or renewable sources yearly by 2030.Shares of LYB have gained 1.5% over the past year compared with a 13.2% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, on its first-quarter call, said it anticipates a slight increase in global demand driven by usual seasonal trends.  The demand for transportation fuels is expected to increase over the summer, supporting oxyfuels and refining margins.  Delays at the beginning of industry-wide capacity expansions for polyethylene in North America are likely to lower new market supply and support polyethylene margins.  To keep pace with the market expectation, LyondellBasell estimates operating Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets at 80%. It expects to modestly raise global olefins and polyolefins operating rates to 85%.  The company will continue to monitor the impact on petrochemical markets in the second half of 2023 of shifting global monetary policies and strengthening economic conditions in China.Story continuesLyondellBasell Industries N.V.

MEC acquired Mid-States Aluminum Corp. (“MSA”), a privately held, vertically integrated manufacturer of custom aluminum extrusions and fabrications, for a net consideration of $90 million on Jul 1. The acquisition was previously expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2023.The closing price came in after certain adjustments for cash, indebtedness, net working capital and certain expenses of MSA, given the purchase price was $95.9 million. On Jun 29, Mayville entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement led by Wells Fargo Bank determining a credit facility increase from $200 million to $250 million and a total borrowing capacity of up to $350 million. A portion of the increased available credit facility was used for MSA’s buyout.Buyout BenefitsMSA offers various value-added services, including design, engineering, extrusions, fabrication and related services. The acquisition of this Wisconsin-based company enabled Mayville to establish a solid and appealing place within lightweight materials fabrication, along with providing significant new cross-selling opportunities with new and existing customers.Mayville expects that MSA’s futuristic design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities will complement its existing operations and provide scope for higher-margin profitable growth within growing adjacent markets. MEC is optimistic about the long-term growth projections from this acquisition which is aligned with its MBX value creation framework.At the closing, MEC determined the acquisition to be immediately accretive, excluding transaction costs, to its earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. For 2023, the buyout is expected to contribute $30-$35 million to net sales and $4-$6 million to adjusted EBITDA, given current market conditions. In 2022, MSA generated total revenues and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $86 million and $16 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was more than 18%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of MEC have gained 48.4% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry's 38.9% growth.Value Creation InitiativeMayville has been witnessing progress in its operational efficiency and top-line growth for a few quarters.

However, an active catastrophe environment could weigh on the upside.The industry continues to witness better pricing. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 22 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last nine quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Analysts at Swiss Re Institute predict premiums to grow 7.5% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2024.The insurance industry is rate sensitive. The Fed has made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 10 since March 2022. However, at its recently concluded FOMC meeting, the committee paused further rate hikes for the time being despite high inflation. The Fed hinted at another increase by 2023 end. Companies that have locked in high interest rates are bound to generate higher yields at this point.Catastrophic events weigh on the underwriting profitability of insurers. The latest report published by CSU states that the 2023 hurricane season may have 15 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. The first quarter of 2023 witnessed economic losses from catastrophes of about $63 billion, per a report from Aon. Nonetheless, analysts at Swiss Re Institute expect combined ratio to improve to 100% in 2023 and 98.5% in 2024.The insurance industry continues to witness accelerated digitalization. Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies.While a solid policyholders’ surplus will help the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level continues to aid insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, increasing dividends or paying out special dividends. Policyholders’ surplus totaled $952.4 billion at 2022 end per a report published in Insurance Journal.The industry has gained 6% year to date compared with the Finance sector’s increase of 4.9%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 17.1% in the said time frame.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely Chubb Limited CB and The Progressive Corporation PGR.  Chubb, with a market capitalization of $79.6 billion, is one of the world’s largest providers of property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance and reinsurance and the largest publicly traded P&amp;C insurer. Progressive, with a market capitalization of $77 billion, is a leading independent agency writer of private passenger auto coverage and the market leader in motorcycle insurance products. Both companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s now see how these P&amp;C insurers have fared in terms of some of the key metrics.Price PerformanceProgressive has gained 1.3% year to date against Chubb’s decline of 13.4%.Return on Equity (ROE)PGR has a return on equity of 14%, which is more than Chubb’s ROE of 13.1% and the industry average of 6.9%.Dividend YieldChubb’s dividend yield of 1.8% tops PGR’s dividend yield of 0.3% and the industry average of 0.4%.Debt-to-EquityProgressive’s debt-to-equity ratio of 36.5 is higher than the industry average of 24.5 as well as Chubb’s reading of 29.8. Growth ProjectionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PGR’s 2023 earnings indicates a 28.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure, while that for CB implies a 15.4% increase.The consensus estimate for PGR’s 2024 earnings indicates a 50.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure, while that for CB suggests a 10.3% rise.The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 25.1% for PGR, better than the industry average of 13.3% and CB’s 10% earnings growth rate.Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CB’s 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved 0.3% and 0.5% north in the past 30 days.  The consensus estimate for PGR’s 2023 EPS has moved 2.4% down while the same for 2024 did not witness any revision in the past 30 days. Combined RatioCombined ratio represents the underwriting profitability of an insurer. CB’s combined ratio deteriorated 200 bps on a year-over-year basis to 86.3% in the first quarter of 2023 while the same for PGR was 99, down 450 bps year over year.To ConcludeOur comparative analysis shows that CB has the edge over PGR with respect to leverage, dividend yield, estimates revision and combined ratio.

CB, The Progressive Corp. PGR, Kinsale Capital Group Ltd. KNSL, RLI Corp. RLI and NMI Holdings NMIH.Industry: Property &amp; Casualty InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2117152/5-property-casualty-insurers-likely-to-gain-despite-catastrophesThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance (P&amp;C) industry is likely to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting and exposure growth. Industry players like Chubb Ltd., The Progressive Corp., Kinsale Capital Group Ltd., RLI Corp. and NMI Holdings are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last nine quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety.Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. Though the Fed paused rate hikes recently, it indicated increases in the year ahead. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. Insurers implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 22 straight quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently.Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners' premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Analysts at Swiss Re Institute predict premiums to grow 7.5% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2024.Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The P&amp;C insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profits. The latest report published by CSU states that the 2023 hurricane season may have 15 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. Catastrophic events weigh on the underwriting profitability of insurers.Nonetheless, analysts at Swiss Re Institute expect the combined ratio to improve to 100% in 2023 and 98.5% in 2024. The first quarter of 2023 witnessed economic losses from catastrophes of about $63 billion, per a report from Aon. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With a sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players.The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk. Also, it poses cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates poor prospects in the near term. The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #171, which places it in the bottom 32% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Earnings estimates have decreased 12.4% quarter to date.Before we present a few property and casualty stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Property and Casualty Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year.

307,9afdba9e-3f94-323e-b30a-67d1e53fcb2b,VLO,2023-07-07,Will Valero Energy (VLO) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-beat-estimates-161015302.html,1688659815,STORY,['VLO'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Valero Energy (VLO), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this oil refiner has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 13.82%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Valero Energy was expected to post earnings of $7.24 per share, but it reported $8.27 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.23%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $7.45 per share, while it actually produced $8.45 per share, a surprise of 13.42%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Valero Energy. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.29%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 27, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

309,9f672892-a37f-3695-afcd-016057ca16dc,UNH,2023-07-07,UnitedHealth's (UNH) Suffering Continues: Should You Hold Tight?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealths-unh-suffering-continues-hold-160100127.html,1688659260,STORY,"['UNH', 'UHS', 'HCA']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is currently under pressure. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, a massive player ($444.9 billion market cap) in the HMO space, has contributed its fair share in that downfall. The questions investors are now asking are: what is going wrong with the company? When will the downfall end? Is there a ray of sunshine on the horizon?Let’s go through the headwinds first.Over the year-to-date period, UnitedHealth shares declined 11.1% compared with the 10.1% and 3.7% fall of the HMO industry and the overall medical sector, respectively. Despite the medical sector’s pull, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has jumped 17.1% during this time, thanks to gains recorded primarily in information technology, as well as communication services sectors.YTD PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast month, UnitedHealth leadership pointed out at the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference that seniors are now undergoing elective surgeries, which were delayed due to the pandemic. This is bound to accelerate medical costs. Our estimate for 2023 medical costs indicates almost 12% year-over-year growth, which will put pressure on margins.Furthermore, higher operating costs and the cost of products sold will likely add to the woe. Our prediction for UNH's total operating costs for 2023 suggests an 11% increase from a year ago. Following UnitedHealth, another industry player, Humana Inc. HUM, signaled a higher-than-expected increase in non-inpatient utilization trends, which will push its benefit expense ratio for the year toward the upper limit of its guided range of 86.3-87.3%.UnitedHealth's international operations continue to witness a decline in membership growth. Even in the first quarter of 2023, membership in its international business dropped 3.7% year over year. This trend will likely affect its premium growth, putting pressure on its global business. Moreover, looking at its 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple, investors might hesitate to pay any further premium. The company currently has a ratio of 17.86X, higher than the industry average of 16.72X.Story continuesThis Too Shall PassThe growth rate in medical costs is expected to gradually minimize as demand for elected procedures normalizes. Our estimate for UNH's 2024 medical costs suggests a little more than 1% year-over-year growth. This means more premiums will remain in hand after paying for the procedures for the health insurer.Rising medical costs are nothing new for health insurers. To reduce the risks related to such events, the companies diversify their operations. As a prime example, UnitedHealth's Optum Health unit is likely to witness higher utilization, especially in ambulatory surgery operations, from the resumption of elective procedures. This will significantly offset the negatives being faced by UnitedHealthcare, its health benefits business.Each sub-segment of Optum, UnitedHealth's health service business, is expected to continue delivering a solid performance, driving the overall segment's growth. Our estimate for 2023 operating income from the segment indicates an almost 11% year-over-year jump. Broadening of pharmacy care services and consistent strengthening of care delivery services will likely be the tailwinds for Optum's sub-segments.UnitedHealth's financial strength enables it to navigate through tough times with ease. Its healthy balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $46.5 billion at the first-quarter end was significantly higher than the short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt of $9.9 billion. Also, UNH's free cash flow after dividends in the trailing 12-month period soared 61% to $28 billion.Its financial flexibility and operating strength allow it to boost shareholder values. Last month, UnitedHealth hiked its quarterly dividend by 14% to $1.88 per share, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend hikes. It also has a well-established history of engaging in share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the company rewarded its stakeholders with buybacks of $2 billion.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth's 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.86 per share, indicating a 12% year-over-year rise. The estimate remained stable over the past week. For 2024, the consensus mark suggests an 11.8% year-over-year jump. The company beat earnings estimates in all the last four quarters, with an average of 4%. The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $364.9 billion, suggesting 12.6% growth from a year ago.Bottom LineWhile UnitedHealth remains an appealing investment option for the long haul, thanks to its new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings and operations, short-term uncertainties persist. Washington's scrutiny of pharmacy benefit managers and concerns related to potential changes in Medicare and Medicaid are putting pressure on companies like UnitedHealth. Despite these near-term hiccups, UNH is worth holding onto. Those who haven't invested in the stock yet, could wait for a greater pullback and grab the stock at a better entry point.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader medical space may look at better-ranked players like HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA and Universal Health Services, Inc. UHS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Headquartered in Nashville, TN, HCA Healthcare operates hospitals and related healthcare entities. The company's prudent acquisitions, rising admissions, diversified business and capital deployment are expected to drive long-term growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $18.10 per share, indicating a 7.2% improvement from the year-ago level. The consensus estimate for HCA’s revenues in 2023 suggests a 5.3% year-over-year rise.King of Prussia, PA-based Universal Health Services operates acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers and other facilities through its subsidiaries. Consistent top-line growth, strong capital position, accretive acquisitions and a solid acute care platform are key positives for the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health Services’ 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.27 per share, signaling 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for UHS’ revenues in 2023 is pegged at $14.1 billion, indicating a 5.4% increase from the year-ago level.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed discussion on Kardashian's business career and ventures, click Kim Kardashian Stock Portfolio: 3 Stocks to Consider.When it comes to launching companies, ventures and brands, Kim Kardashian’s track record is quite impressive. The 42 year-old media star whose first media appearance was as an assistant of Paris Hilton in the early 2000s quickly rose to fame and later dominated the industry. According to several media sources, Kardashian’s total worth as of 2023 stands at over $1 billion. Kardashian’s astute business and marketing skills let her leverage her fame in the media and beauty industry to launch several fashion and beauty brands. Kim Kardashian, who has about 359 million followers on Instagram, harnessed the true power of her social media influence and launched her shapewear, loungewear and underwear brand Skims back in 2019.  In 2021 alone the brand produced $275 million in sales. Skims was so successful that even some of the most respected investors in Wall Street paid attention to the company and poured money into it. In 2022 Skims received $240 million in new funding which was led by the famous Tiger Cub investor and billionaire Stephen Mandel. The funding round also included billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s D1 Capital. The fact that some of the notable billionaires decided to invest in Kardashian’s company shows that Kardashian’s business ventures are taken seriously by investors, unlike some ventures started by other celebrities in the past which failed to garner success.Kardashian's Partnership with HULUAfter ending her contract with E! for her all-time famous show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the Kardashians joined Hulu for their new show The Kardashians. Several media reports suggested that the streaming platform signed a deal worth about $100 million with the Kardashian family.Story continuesDuring the Hulu show the Kardashians aggressively promote their brands and companies, which is reportedly boosting their sales. A Time report from 2022 quoted Krishna Subramanian, co-founder of the influencer marketing firm Captiv8, who said that according to her estimates a 30-second mention of any of the family’s brands in an episode could be valued anywhere from $500,000 to $1.5 million.Kim Kardashian's Business VenturesCelebrity-backed funds and investment vehicles don’t have an impressive past. For example, the SPAC boom that started after the pandemic and saw its peak in 2021 caused many celebrities to launch and back different SPACs. But all of that came crashing down as 21 out of 33 SPACs linked to famous public figures posted negative returns in 2021, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited Matt Tuttle, the chief at Tuttle Capital Management, who thinks that celebrities do a pretty good job at getting the marketing boost but their part begins to fade after companies and funds enter the important phases of business.“Celebrities are eye candy, unless there’s really good reasoning to have them on board. At some point these companies need to deliver on a real mission, and it becomes less about the marketing and more about the strategy,” Tuttle reportedly said.Kim Kardashian has had her fair share of losses and setbacks too. Perhaps her relentlessness and consistency gave her an added advantage in the industry in addition to her influence and social media following. For example,  Kim, Khloé, and Kourtney started their first clothing brand called Dash during the Keeping Up with the Kardashians days. The brand received a lot of hype and promotion but it was ultimately shuttered in 2018. Kim was also one of the endorsers of Ethereum Max (EMAX), the Ethereum-based token that once generated a lot of hype and endorsements from celebrities. When the token started posting huge losses, an angry investor sued Kim Kardashian, along with other endorsers Floyd Mayweather and Paul Pierce. The investor alleged that the stars colluded with EMAX co-founders Steve Gentile and Giovanni Perone in a pump-and-dump scheme.Kim Kardashian also launched beauty and fragrance brands KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance but later shut them down for rebranding. In 2022 the celebrity launched SKKN for Kim, a skincare products brand.Kim Kardashian Enters Private EquityKim Kardashian’s latest and perhaps most impressive foray in the investing world came last year when she announced to form a private equity company in partnership with Jay Sammons, an industry veteran who had worked as a partner at Carlyle Group. The PE firm, SKKY Partners, will make investments in the consumer products, hospitality, luxury, digital commerce and media as well as consumer-media and entertainment businesses.SKKY Partners has been on a hiring spree lately. Bloomberg in April reported that the firm has hired about six professionals from the finance industry, including a new COO who comes from PE Apollo Global Management Inc. The Bloomberg report quoted Sammons, who said that SKKY Partners now has about 12 employees and the company plans to take this number to 15 by the end of 2023Over the years Kim Kardashian has also developed a keen interest in law. She also tried several times to pass the Baby Bar exam in California and finally did it last year. Her podcast on Spotify also talks about a case where a person had to spend several years without any evidence against him. Talking to Variety about what sparked her interest in the law industry, Kardashian said:""When I went to the White House [in 2020] and was able to get someone released from prison, that was the biggest moment for me where I realized I can make a difference. I really had no idea what the system was like, or I just was really ignorant to everything that goes on. Once I learned about it and saw what really happens, I felt like there was so much more that had to be done. We only have so much time on this planet that I just want to do everything as quick as possible. There are a lot of people that can’t fight for themselves and if I can make a difference and fight for them, I would so badly want to. It’s like not really a choice. I just don’t even feel like it’s an option. This is what they need.""Kim Kardashian Stock Portfolio: Top Stocks to ConsiderBy VOGUE Taiwan - At Home With Kim Kardashian - The End of An Era｜Vogue Taiwan, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=119951135Our MethodologyFor this article, we picked top companies which Kim Kardashian directly invested in or has indirect partnerships with. Some of these stocks were part of Kardashian's portfolio gifted to her by her then-husband Kanye West, while the other companies in the article had or currently have partnerships with the star or her family.

(NASDAQ:NFLX).Don't Miss: Kanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock PortfolioKim Kardashian Stock Portfolio: 8 Stocks to Consider8. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)While not a direct partner of Kim Kardashian, the New York-based beauty products company The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in 2016 launched Estee Edit, a beauty products brand, in partnership with Kim’s half-sister Kendall Jenner. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) took Jenner on board as the company’s promotional star on social media. Estee Edit was launched with high hopes, with some sources claiming that brand was estimated to have sales of $60 million in North America alone in its first year. However, the brand apparently failed as Estee Lauder shuttered it in 2017.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) saw a significant jump in hedge fund sentiment earlier this year. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 59 hedge funds reported owning stakes in The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), up from 44 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The biggest stakeholder of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) at the end of March 2023 was Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP which owned a $1.3 billion stake in the company.ClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), which manufactures and markets cosmetics, fragrances, skin and hair care products across a number of well-known global brands including Clinique, MAC and Bobbi Brown, adds to our group of secular growers. Estee Lauder is a global leader in the prestige beauty space, which has outgrown the broader home and personal care category since 2010 and has historically been recession resilient. The company has substantial brand and pricing power and is overindexed to the highly profitable prestige skin care category. We believe the company’s most recent earnings report and 2023 guidance update, which was cut significantly due to uncertainty over China’s zero-COVID policy (China and travel retail are key growth drivers), provided an attractive entry point. At this point, we believe the stock has been significantly derisked and could see potential upside from a China recovery.”7. Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY)Kim Kardashian and French-American beauty products company Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) have been partnering for several years. Back in 2020, Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) announced to acquire a 20% stake in Kim Kardashian’s beauty brand KKW Beauty for $200 million. However, the brand was later shut down as Kim Kardashian partnered again with the company to launch SKKN by Kim brand which included products like cleanser, toner, exfoliator, and several serums and creams. In 2020, In January, Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) acquired a 51% stake in Kardashian West’s half-sister Kylie Jenner’s brands.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 21 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY). The total value of these stakes was $118 million. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) during this period was Woodline Partners of Michael Rockefeller and Karl Kroeker which owned a $15.25 million stake in the company.ClearBridge Mid Cap Strategy made the following comment about Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY), a global beauty company made up of prestige fragrance and cosmetic businesses, also generated positive performance. Despite concerns of slowing consumer demand, the company continues to execute and exceed expectations through margin improvement, resilient Chinese demand and growing market share within mass market cosmetics in the U.S. We view Coty as exceptionally undervalued due to its historically high leverage but believe continued margin improvement and strong execution will improve its balance sheet and attractiveness to fundamentals-focused investors.”6. Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT)Back in 2020, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) signed a deal with Kim Kardashian for an exclusive podcast. This came just weeks after Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT)’s $100 million deal with Joe Rogan which saw Rogan bringing his podcast exclusively to the streaming platform. However, financial details of Kardashian’s deal with Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) were not available. “The System” podcast of Kim Kardashian on Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) focuses on investigative work based on true crime stories.Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) shares jumped in April 2023 after the company reported that it added a whopping 5 million premium subscribers in the first quarter. Analysts have expected 2.23 million new additions.A total of 59 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stake in Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

(NYSE:SPOT) was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which had a $321 million stake in the company.Baron Partners Fund made the following comment about Spotify Technology S.A.

Shares of Spotify were down on weakness in the company’s fourth quarter gross margin guide. We still view Spotify as a long-term winner in music streaming with potential to reach more than one billion active monthly users. Subscriber additions remain strong, price increases seem likely, and cost discipline has become a bigger focus.”5. adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY)Back in 2017, the then-husband of Kim Kardashian gifted her some stocks as a Christmas present. The gift included about 1,000 shares of adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY). At the time, adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY) was trading at around $98, but as of June 5 the stock price has fallen to about $85.adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY) recently announced that it will begin selling some of the last remaining items from Kanye West’s YEEZY brand. Adidas cut ties with West last year.adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY) said that the proceeds generated from the remaining Yeezy product sales will be donated to organizations “working to combat discrimination and hate, including racism and antisemitism.”4. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Kim Kardashian’s stock portfolio gifted to her by Kanye West back in December 2017 included about 85 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.

(ELC) (NYSE: EL) today announced that the company and several of its brands presented a range of novel preclinical and clinical findings at the 25th World Congress of Dermatology, held this week in Singapore. The poster and satellite symposium presentations reflect a strong portfolio of prestige beauty and skin care brands effectively translating biological learnings and progressive research efforts into meaningful innovation, including better methods to care for and protect skin.Estee Lauder Companies (PRNewsfoto/The Estée Lauder Companies)""For over 75 years, innovation in skin science has been our north star. With rapidly emerging knowledge and advancements from the dermatologic and scientific communities, the science of skin care has never been more important,"" said Lisa Napolione, Senior Vice President, Global Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D). ""As we live longer, research on health span and longevity will only accelerate. To meet these innovation challenges, we are thinking differently, and in a manner enabled by novel science across all our global laboratories and clinics.""Additional poster details highlighting key data are as follows.Title: The benefits of regular use of moisturizer to skin aging prevention: a six-month evaluator blinded, randomized, and controlled clinical studyPresenter: Hao Ouyang, PhD, Executive Director, Clinical SciencesKey Takeaways: Moisturizers are routinely used to treat dry skin conditions and are considered the basis of skin care, but the long-term standalone benefits of consistent application have not been fully demonstrated with randomized controlled trial clinical studies.This evaluator-blinded, randomized, 6-month longitudinal study evaluated 160 women, aged 35-65, with dry skin, mild to moderate crow's feet wrinkles, and a low frequency of skin care regimen. Participants were split into two groups: one using moisturizer regularly and the other continuing at a low frequency.Results revealed that regular application of a potent moisturizer can not only treat skin dryness, but also improve the dry skin stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the epidermis) cohesion to reduce the appearance of facial aging.Story continuesTitle: The effect of a multi-ingredient facial cream on skin structure, function, and appearance: evidence from ex vivo and clinical studiesPresenter: Jaime Emmetsberger, PhD, La Mer's Max Huber Research Labs Lead ScientistKey Takeaways:La Mer scientists evaluated a topical cream formulation containing Macrocystis pyrifera ferment and other ingredients in clinical studies with participants with a range of skin tones.In in vivo experiments, the cream improved skin barrier recovery and resilience, mitigated visible redness (erythema) in addition to irritation and demonstrated a reduction in hallmark signs of aged skin in U.S.- and Asia-based populations.Histological assessment of ex vivo human skin explants suggested that topical application enhanced key extracellular matrix proteins and hyaluronic acid, corroborating in vivo results.Findings suggest the facial cream provides an effective treatment for improving barrier integrity and strength as well as signs of aging parameters and skin appearance with regular daily use.Title: The importance of Sirt2 in regulating mechanobiology of the skinPresenter: Nadine Pernodet, PhD, Senior Vice President, Bioscience and Lead Scientist Estée Lauder Research LaboratoriesKey Takeaways:Estée Lauder researchers examined the role of sirtuins (SIRTs) or ""longevity proteins"" – a class of enzymes synchronized to circadian rhythms that regulate protein expression – in promoting youthful skin properties.Treatment with SIRT 1, 2, 3, and 6 activators helped to rebuild protein structure and increased collagen production in mature skin cells, while the combination of SIRT 1 and 3 activators increased elastin and fibrillin production in ex vivo skin samples. Activation of SIRT2 also increased skin cell area – a hallmark feature typical of younger skin cells.Taken together, all four activators exerted different effects to preserve the mechanical properties of young skin.Title: Anti-glycation and anti-sallowness effects of certain materials in 3D skin equivalent modelsPresenter: Tom Mammone, PhD, Vice President, Advanced Technologies, BioscienceKey Takeaways: One cause of skin aging and a sallow complexion is glycation – a chemical modification that occurs on sugar molecules and leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs can be detected using measurements of auto-fluorescence at different excitation/emission wavelengths within the UV and blue spectrum.Using 3D skin models, researchers studied the anti-glycation properties of 6 compounds to determine their capacities to reduce auto-fluorescence in 3D skin models.These results reveal that the anti-glycation capacity of compounds used in skin care formulations may be associated with the reduced appearance of skin sallowness.Title: A topical cosmetic serum with a targeted, triple action approach provides anti-aging benefits equal to a single laser treatmentPresenter: Kristine Schmalenberg, PhD, Executive Director, Clinical SciencesKey Takeaways: A Clinique-led clinical trial evaluated a combination of ingredients that supported natural skin repair versus a single laser treatment in a population of 42 women with moderate facial photodamage.The efficacy and tolerability of the topical product versus a single ablative laser treatment was assessed over 16 weeks.While no statistically significant differences in tolerability were observed, treatment with the cosmetic topical product achieved a statistically significant improvement in all measured parameters compared to a single laser treatment, thereby showing parity on those parameters.About The Estée Lauder CompaniesThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. is one of the world's leading manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products, and is a steward of outstanding luxury and prestige brands globally.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. SL Green (SLG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 19, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.36 a share.SL Green's Earnings ESP sits at 1.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.36 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34.SLG is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs.

If you want to skip our analysis of the real estate industry, head on over to 5 Best Residential Real Estate Stocks To Buy. The real estate industry is one of the most crucial sectors in today's high rate environment. Along with banks, real estate firms are ones that are particularly sensitive to interest rate hikes since higher rates reduce consumer appetite for mortgages and make it costlier to finance new construction projects.Potential trouble in the industry also threatens the economy as a whole since real estate accounts for significant consumer spending and creates employment for thousands of people. The industry is also one of the most valuable in the world, with a research report suggesting that the global real estate market was worth a whopping $3.69 trillion in 2021 and it is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% by 2030 to be worth $5.85 trillion. Due to heavy spending in the area, the commercial real estate segment is the most valuable component of the real estate industry, but spending on properties such as villas is expected to grow faster than the broader market through a CAGR of 6.1%. If you're interested in the commercial real estate market and want to know about some top stocks, be sure to check out 10 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Not to mention, the massive size of the industry also makes real estate firms some of the most valuable in the world. Our research covering the most valuable real estate companies in the world shows that the top three firms are Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT).Shifting our focus on America, properties in the U.S. are estimated to be worth $20 trillion but values slumped in March as spending in the segment slowed down. The rapid interest rate hikes have hit the commercial real estate industry quite hard. Prices have dropped to multi decade lows this year, with towers costing less than plots of land would have before - with some buildings in New York being less in worth than the land that they are sitting on. Property dealers are also being forced to hand back buildings to lenders, and as a whole, office buildings in New York have been estimated to have lost $76 billion in value.Story continuesMoving to residential real estate, while its woes might be lesser than the commercial side of things, nevertheless, the market has felt its fair share of shocks. The biggest example of this is Fortune Magazine's latest release of its Fortune 500 list in June. This list saw four firms, namely Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT), Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), Anywhere Real Estate Inc. (NYSE:HOUS), and Compass, Inc. (NYSE:COMP) fail to make it this time around - indicating just how severely the sector has been hit. Not to mention, shares of the residential real estate firm Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN) are down to just $4.28 from a peak of $34.59 in February 2021 in the wake of a disastrous series of bets in plummeting real estate market.This devastation has happened as new home prices dropped by 10% from their peak levels in February 2023. U.S. home prices as measured by the Case-Shiller Index show that from a peak index level of 308 in June 2022, the index bottomed out of 292.7 in January 2023 and posted a small recovery of 293 in February 2023. However, there seems to be a recovery in the making, as since February, the prices are on an upward trend with the latest reading of April 2023, the Case-Shiller index standing at 301.46.The upward trend is supported by a slew of metrics. For instance, the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now tracker for the second quarter showed that the residential real estate sector added 0.1% to the economy as measured on June 20th. Analysts believe that a reduction in supply constraints has enabled coronavirus backlogs to clear out, but worries persist that if interest rates continue to rise, then fresh demand could lag and disincentivize home builders from making new houses. Adding to this is the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo's regional housing index. Its latest reading for June added a sixth month of consecutive growth, with the metric sitting at 55. Within the index, the home index in the U.S. South is leading the charge, with single family home sales for the next six months also showing significant growth.As to what residential real estate companies are thinking, here is what the management of Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) shared during its latest earnings call:Beginning in the first week of January, demand has picked up beyond the normal seasonality that we typically see at the start of the spring selling season and has continued into February. We’ve seen demand improve in most markets across the country, including Florida, Atlanta, South Carolina, Charlotte, D.C. Metro, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas Colorado and Southern California. Over the past few weeks, we have also seen signs that demand is improving in markets that struggled the most in the second half of 2022, such as Boise, Phoenix, Reno, Las Vegas and Austin. We attribute the increase in demand to improve buyer sentiment as inflation appears to be receding and the overall economic outlook seems to be more stable than it was a few months ago.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great residential real estate stocks to buy according to hedge fund sentiment, out of which the top picks are D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and NVR, Inc.

DHI, one of America's leading homebuilders, acquired Truland Homes, the largest private homebuilder along the Gulf Coast. This strategic move will solidify D.R. Horton's position in the region and unlock significant growth opportunities.Buyout SynergiesTruland Homes brings an impressive portfolio of assets to the table, including approximately 263 lots, 155 homes in inventory and 55 homes in the sales order backlog. In addition, D.R. Horton has gained control of an additional 357 lots through option contracts from Truland affiliates and third parties. With Truland's strong performance, having closed 512 homes and generating $244 million in revenues in 2022, the potential for future success is evident.The acquisition will be completed for an estimated $100 million in cash, allowing D.R. Horton to integrate Truland's operations into its existing platforms in Baldwin County, AL, and Northwest Florida. This consolidation will enhance operational efficiency and streamline processes, enabling D.R. Horton to deliver homes more effectively to its customers.Further, the acquisition of Truland Homes aligns with D.R. Horton's growth strategy and reaffirms its commitment to delivering high-quality homes to customers across the United States. With an expanded presence in the Gulf Coast market, D.R. Horton is well-positioned to capitalize on the region's growing demand for housing.Acquisitions – a Major Tool for ExpansionD.R. Horton has been actively pursuing acquisitions as part of its growth strategy, focusing on acquiring homebuilding companies in lucrative markets.

Despite a 19% decrease from the previous year, the company's homebuilding investments in lots, land and development for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $1.7 million, remaining relatively stable compared to the previous quarter.By selectively investing in attractively-priced land and lots over the past few years, D.R.

Morgan Stanley raises Microsoft's price target to $415. JetBlue ends its alliance with American Airlines as it pursues an acquisition of Spirit Airlines. Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita check out several top trending stocks after Thursday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: That closes out today's trading action. All three of the major averages under pressure following that very strong ADP report before the bell. The Dow closing off its lows of the day, off just around 365 points. S&amp;P off about 8/10 of percent as well as the NASDAQ.Let's take a look at some of the trending tickers. The top one on Yahoo Finance today, Affirm, the stock sliding roughly 10% after a downgrade to underweight from neutral. Piper Sandler, the analyst there citing higher rates. Also the restart of student loan payments as a couple of headwinds here facing Affirm.He also talked about, Akiko, some competition. We know Apple Pay later the new entrant into that space bringing up some questions just about their ability to attain that revenue growth that they've laid out in terms of their forecast.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, competition a big one. But higher rates, you could argue even bigger when you think about the impact it's likely to have on Affirm. The analyst specifically, saying, that Affirm relies on loan sales to drive a huge part of their revenue.And if you look at where the company is right now, they've increasingly held on to some of those loans on their balance sheet with higher rates. That's an even bigger concern. And you see that downgrade today reflected in the stock at least down about 10 and 1/2%.We are also watching Microsoft shares a top performer on the Dow today. Morgan Stanley raising its price target on the stock, naming it a top pick in large cap software. Behind all of that, of course, optimism in Microsoft's AI exposure. We're talking specifically about OpenAI, ChatGPT.Story continuesBy the way, Morgan Stanley increasing their price target by roughly 24%. Huge upside there. They say specifically that Microsoft is poised to top a $3 trillion valuation in early 2024 because of the big bump they're getting from AISEANA SMITH: Yeah. Akiko, they're not buying the fact that there's some concern out there that Microsoft is overvalued at this point. Lots of concern about whether the AI hype has been overdone. They're really reiterating the fact that they believe that Microsoft is a leader in this space and what's driving that narrative. This is a team led by Keith Weiss.Is that their best position in software to monetize some of the expansion that they are expected to see as the automated workflow, that's a result of generative AI. As we talk about the fact that generative AI is going to disrupt jobs and how people think about jobs and do their jobs.Morgan Stanley making the argument that Microsoft is best positioned to capitalize on that. We know obviously Microsoft has been really pushing even further into the AI space working it into various parts of their business, overhauling their entire lineup of office apps. So Morgan Stanley thinking that they are going to remain the leader in the space, at least for now.We're also keeping a close eye on shares of JetBlue. The company announcing that it's going to end its alliance with American Airlines in the northeast. JetBlue saying that it will focus on its acquisition of Spirit, so a bit of a shift here from the airline. Not necessarily a surprise.We know they have been really focusing on Spirit and what exactly that's going to do for their business going forward. A 7% drop though, in the stock today. Akiko, one of the biggest drops that we've seen and biggest intraday drop since MarchAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I'm a little surprised by the drop because to your point, Seana, is so much of this and the potential for that alliance coming to an end came up during the whole acquisition, talking whether, in fact, JetBlue was finally going to acquire Spirit, which they did.You could have argued that was kind of priced in. But I mean, I guess at least if you look at where the stock is right now, pointing to potentially a bumpy road ahead.SEANA SMITH: Yeah there are some optimists out there. They were holding on to hope. They didn't want to buy the headlines and certainly we are seeing a sell the news type of reaction today.]"

JetBlue is continuing its $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines. Yahoo Finance Live's Brad Smith and Diane King Hall take a look at what this means for the airline and the companies' stock movement.Video Transcript- We're keeping an eye on airline shares today. Take a look at shares of JetBlue and American Airlines, both under some pressure. JetBlue down 2%, American down almost a 1 and 1/2% after terminating its partnership with American, that will be JetBlue. That's following a federal judge ordering the two carriers to end their agreement over antitrust issues back in May.Now, JetBlue saying in a statement that the airline will focus on completing its $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines, which we know that's been met with some pushback from the Biden administration as well arguing about just the issues with decreasing the competitive landscape with that tie up there. But JetBlue fought for that deal.- Yeah, well, and for JetBlue, the context here around the Northeast alliance, this was something that had commenced back in-- or at least was announced back in July of 2021. And according to the Justice Department resulted in those operators really taking up about 80% of the market share between some of the locations spanning Boston and Washington. So you think about those routes.But again, the Northeastern alliance between American and JetBlue and those major airports that they service, that was long looked at as an area that was going to be due for some regulatory scrutiny. But at a time where there is more capacity coming online for all of the airlines that are trying to get back to or still get back to pre-pandemic capacity or in the case of JetBlue and of course, the battle over one of my least favorite airlines, the Spirit.Story continues- I'm not--- I've not been bashful about that.- It's the same. I'm going to say--- But on metrics here, it's an airline that has very low net promoter score, all right? So it's not just me saying that, it's the facts.- Yes. I mean, they fought for this one. But what has been-- while the dissolving of the partnership between JetBlue and America hasn't been good for the shares of either of those companies, Spirit getting a boost today. Spirit flying a little bit higher. Sorry, had to. But a bum.- Good for them.]"

American said that it has ""respect"" for JetBlue's decision.New York-based JetBlue said it will instead focus on its planned $3.8 billion merger with Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) -- the biggest in the U.S. airline industry since the tie-up between American and US Airways in 2013.By terminating the American partnership, JetBlue argued that the U.S. Department of Justice's objections to the Spirit merger have been rendered ""entirely moot.""

325,10760871-5cff-32ba-af60-a055850ae5ac,PFG,2023-07-07,15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-nasdaq-stocks-buy-152234085.html,1688656954,STORY,"['COMP', '^DJI', 'GOOGL', 'WSC', 'DXCM', 'GLNG', 'TRIP', 'RETA', 'PFG', 'HOOD', 'OPCH', 'BHF', 'SANM', 'MASI']","[In this piece, we will take a look at 15 best NASDAQ stocks to buy today. If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market, market indexes, and recent developments, head on over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today. The U.S. economy finally appears to be stabilizing. Throughout 2023, worries of a recession have plagued investor minds as many worried that the Federal Reserve had gone too far in its interest rate hikes. However, June dealt markets a nice surprise as the Commerce Department upgraded its estimates for the first quarter of 2023's GDP growth. This third revision showed that the economy had posted an annual growth rate of 2% in Q1 2023, up by 70 basis points (0.7%) from the previous estimates.This data came as two and a half days of trading were left before the 4th of July holiday, and after opening at 13,592 on the day of the release, the NASDAQ Composite index closed at 13,816 the day before the holiday to pocket a modest 1.6% growth. The effect of this release was also reflected in the currency markets, with the U.S. dollar tumbling against major currencies as investors readjusted their sentiments of potential interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.Crucially though, 2023's first half has proven to be remarkable for the stock market. The NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ 100 are up by 33% and 40% this year (its best first half performance in history) - quite different from what many investors were expecting heading into this year riding on the back of high interest rates and high inflation. The two NASDAQs are also among the best performing indexes this year, as the S&amp;P500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained 16.51% and 3.87%, respectively.The NASDAQ also ranks second on the list of the world's biggest stock exchanges. As of January 2023, the total market capitalization of all firms listed on it stood at $18 trillion - surpassed only by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) which had a market capitalization of $22 trillion. This value is greater than the world's third and fourth biggest stock exchanges, namely the Euronext N.V. exchanges and the Japan Exchange Group Exchanges.Story continuesYet, even as the stock market appears to be robust, the debate has already started about a bigger market - the bond market. The apparent simmering upshoots of negativity in the bond market came to the forefront on the same day that Commerce upgraded its GDP estimates. In an opinion piece, former New York Federal Reserve president Bill Dudley claimed that the yields on 10 year U.S. bonds will shoot up to 4.5% - up from the roughly 3.75% right now. He explained that due to the tight labor market, persistent inflation, and robust economy, the Fed might be forced to maintain high interest rates for longer. He also added that the Fed is also forced to ensure that inflation remains around 2% since if it falls too much then its utility to stimulate economic growth also falls. Finally, he factored in the reduced demand for U.S. government treasuries to indicate that the risk premium investors demand for these bonds will go up. Putting all these together, he arrived at a 4.5% yield estimate - and one that has generated quite a bit of controversy.Leading the charge against the former Fed official with years of experience in investment banking, are analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). They believe that instead of the yields shooting up to 4.5% (which indicates a sharp decrease in the bond price and creates an incentive for existing bondholders to sell their instruments), the yields will actually drop to 2% and 3% from the current 3.85%. They also countered the components of Mr. Dudley's 4.5% estimate, namely the one involving 1% short term interest rates. The Morgan Stanley analysts believe that short term rates can increase to a maximum 0.5%, with average inflation expected to sit at 2% instead of 2.5% over the long term as assumed by Dudley.But what if both stocks and bonds were headed for a downturn this year? Well, that's what's on the mind of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associate's co-chief investment officer Mr. Greg Jensen, who outlined in a recent podcast:My view is you end up with growth disappointing a bit and inflation disappointing on the high side a bit, ending up probably bad for bonds and probably a little bit bad for equities and generally weak growth. And if that weak growth starts to translate into a rising savings rate, you could easily end up in a recession and one that’s going to be difficult to deal with. I’ve tamed and we’ve tamed at Bridgewater, to some degree, our view on growth. While still negative, [IT'S] not as extreme as it appeared and it’s a more gradual process that’s unfolding.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top NASDAQ stocks that might be interesting to look at. Out of these, the notable picks are DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:WSC).15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy TodayPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best NASDAQ stocks, we first started by compiling a list of the biggest companies on the exchange in terms of market capitalization. However, this naturally biases the list in favor of mega cap stocks, leaving little utility to our list of top NASDAQ stocks. So, we filtered the list by including only those firms that were rated Hold or better. While choosing stocks rated Hold sounds counterintuitive, it provides a better contrast between analyst sentiment and hedge fund sentiment since some Hold stocks might have more investors than Buy stocks. The list was narrowed down to stocks with a market capitalization greater than $2 billion. These were ranked by analyst sentiment. Out of the top forty stocks in the list, the ones with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2023 were chosen for our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy.15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today15.

Principal® is a board member and one of seven owning members of PSN, which utilizes the auto-portability solution created by Retirement Clearinghouse, LLC (RCH).""As a retirement leader, it's our responsibility and commitment to help create the best possible retirement outcomes for America's workers, including making it easy for their retirement savings to move with them,"" said Teresa Hassara, senior vice president for Retirement and Income Solutions at Principal. ""Being a part of the Portability Services Network adds another tool to the toolbox we have at Principal to support individuals on their paths to achieving financial security.""""We are excited to have Principal join the consortium of recordkeepers that are working together with Portability Services Network to improve workers' retirement security. The company's leadership, action, and progress to increase financial access and inclusion will help more people benefit from auto-portability - in particular people of color, lower-income workers, and women, who have higher than average cash-out rates,"" said Robert L. Johnson, chairman of The RLJ Companies and chairman of Portability Services Network and Retirement Clearinghouse.According to RCH, employees changing jobs more frequently and a limited ability to match participant accounts across plan provider systems have increased the need for auto-portability - defined as automatically transferring an employee's retirement savings from their prior employer's plan to their new employer's plan. Approximately $92 billion in savings is prematurely cashed out of workplace retirement accounts every year1, leading to additional tax implications and early withdrawal penalties for workers. This disproportionately impacts those with lower retirement account balances - typically less than $5,000.Story continuesPSN will assist workers with lower balances who change employers by automatically matching and moving their workplace retirement savings to their new retirement plans. Its goal is to establish a nationwide, digital hub connecting workplace retirement plan recordkeepers and the employers they serve. The automation process will help workers avoid unnecessary complications as they move assets into 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), and 457 accounts, which could mitigate early plan cash-outs and enable financial security for more American workers.The consortium currently represents approximately 82 million workers across more than 185,000 employer-sponsored retirement plans, based on data published by Pensions &amp; Investments. As the latest owning member to join PSN, Principal adds approximately 11 million retirement plan participants and more than 46,000 plans to the coalition.2 The new service is expected to go live for participants in plans with administrative services provided by Principal in early 2025.About Principal Financial Group®Principal Financial Group® (Nasdaq: PFG) is a global financial company with 19,000 employees3 passionate about improving the wealth and well-being of people and businesses.

327,9f672892-a37f-3695-afcd-016057ca16dc,UHS,2023-07-07,UnitedHealth's (UNH) Suffering Continues: Should You Hold Tight?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealths-unh-suffering-continues-hold-160100127.html,1688659260,STORY,"['UNH', 'UHS', 'HCA']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is currently under pressure. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, a massive player ($444.9 billion market cap) in the HMO space, has contributed its fair share in that downfall. The questions investors are now asking are: what is going wrong with the company? When will the downfall end? Is there a ray of sunshine on the horizon?Let’s go through the headwinds first.Over the year-to-date period, UnitedHealth shares declined 11.1% compared with the 10.1% and 3.7% fall of the HMO industry and the overall medical sector, respectively. Despite the medical sector’s pull, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has jumped 17.1% during this time, thanks to gains recorded primarily in information technology, as well as communication services sectors.YTD PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast month, UnitedHealth leadership pointed out at the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference that seniors are now undergoing elective surgeries, which were delayed due to the pandemic. This is bound to accelerate medical costs. Our estimate for 2023 medical costs indicates almost 12% year-over-year growth, which will put pressure on margins.Furthermore, higher operating costs and the cost of products sold will likely add to the woe. Our prediction for UNH's total operating costs for 2023 suggests an 11% increase from a year ago. Following UnitedHealth, another industry player, Humana Inc. HUM, signaled a higher-than-expected increase in non-inpatient utilization trends, which will push its benefit expense ratio for the year toward the upper limit of its guided range of 86.3-87.3%.UnitedHealth's international operations continue to witness a decline in membership growth. Even in the first quarter of 2023, membership in its international business dropped 3.7% year over year. This trend will likely affect its premium growth, putting pressure on its global business. Moreover, looking at its 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple, investors might hesitate to pay any further premium. The company currently has a ratio of 17.86X, higher than the industry average of 16.72X.Story continuesThis Too Shall PassThe growth rate in medical costs is expected to gradually minimize as demand for elected procedures normalizes. Our estimate for UNH's 2024 medical costs suggests a little more than 1% year-over-year growth. This means more premiums will remain in hand after paying for the procedures for the health insurer.Rising medical costs are nothing new for health insurers. To reduce the risks related to such events, the companies diversify their operations. As a prime example, UnitedHealth's Optum Health unit is likely to witness higher utilization, especially in ambulatory surgery operations, from the resumption of elective procedures. This will significantly offset the negatives being faced by UnitedHealthcare, its health benefits business.Each sub-segment of Optum, UnitedHealth's health service business, is expected to continue delivering a solid performance, driving the overall segment's growth. Our estimate for 2023 operating income from the segment indicates an almost 11% year-over-year jump. Broadening of pharmacy care services and consistent strengthening of care delivery services will likely be the tailwinds for Optum's sub-segments.UnitedHealth's financial strength enables it to navigate through tough times with ease. Its healthy balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $46.5 billion at the first-quarter end was significantly higher than the short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt of $9.9 billion. Also, UNH's free cash flow after dividends in the trailing 12-month period soared 61% to $28 billion.Its financial flexibility and operating strength allow it to boost shareholder values. Last month, UnitedHealth hiked its quarterly dividend by 14% to $1.88 per share, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend hikes. It also has a well-established history of engaging in share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the company rewarded its stakeholders with buybacks of $2 billion.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth's 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.86 per share, indicating a 12% year-over-year rise. The estimate remained stable over the past week. For 2024, the consensus mark suggests an 11.8% year-over-year jump. The company beat earnings estimates in all the last four quarters, with an average of 4%. The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $364.9 billion, suggesting 12.6% growth from a year ago.Bottom LineWhile UnitedHealth remains an appealing investment option for the long haul, thanks to its new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings and operations, short-term uncertainties persist. Washington's scrutiny of pharmacy benefit managers and concerns related to potential changes in Medicare and Medicaid are putting pressure on companies like UnitedHealth. Despite these near-term hiccups, UNH is worth holding onto. Those who haven't invested in the stock yet, could wait for a greater pullback and grab the stock at a better entry point.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader medical space may look at better-ranked players like HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA and Universal Health Services, Inc. UHS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Headquartered in Nashville, TN, HCA Healthcare operates hospitals and related healthcare entities. The company's prudent acquisitions, rising admissions, diversified business and capital deployment are expected to drive long-term growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $18.10 per share, indicating a 7.2% improvement from the year-ago level. The consensus estimate for HCA’s revenues in 2023 suggests a 5.3% year-over-year rise.King of Prussia, PA-based Universal Health Services operates acute care hospitals, behavioral health centers and other facilities through its subsidiaries.

329,65ed2e7e-72b9-3543-a9fd-0d2e2cf10c84,FCX,2023-07-07,Why Are China And America Fighting Over This Unknown Mineral?,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-china-america-fighting-over-230100836.html,1688684460,STORY,"['SI=F', 'GC=F', 'HG=F', 'RIO', 'FMC', 'SCCO', 'VALE', 'MT', 'GLNCY', 'FCX', 'LTHM', 'CMP']","[In recent years, critical minerals have become intimately linked with the national security of Western nations.Access to critical minerals is essential to any country hoping to gain or maintain technological superiority over its rivals - a fact that China was distinctly aware of when it moved to buy up the industry over a decade ago.But now a fightback is underway.Around the world, governments are racing to secure their critical mineral supply chains as they invest heavily in new exploration and production.In fact, Canada was so concerned about critical minerals supply that it forced three Chinese companies to sell their mining assets in the country.And as these countries move to combat China, the non-Chinese companies sitting on the strategically vital resources are becoming increasingly important.In Canada, for example, when the Chinese companies were forced to divest their ownership interests in the country - one Canadian miner, PowerMetals Corp (TSXV:PWM,OTC: PWRMF), was left in control of not only a potential high-quality lithium mine but what might become the only functioning cesium mine in the world that China doesn’t own.And while cesium may not be as well-known as lithium, it is undoubtedly critical.Cesium is central to the United States’ goal of winning the 5G race, it plays a key role in aircraft guidance systems, oil and gas drilling, and global positioning satellites.And despite its importance, all the known cesium deposits around the world have either been depleted, or the mines have been rendered inoperable.All of this could leave PowerMetals Corp and its Case Lake project as one of the most unique and exciting natural resource plays in the world today.A ‘Geologist’s Dream’It isn’t just the geopolitical context and resource quality that makes PowerMetals Corp (TSXV:PWM,OTC: PWRMF) such an intriguing prospect. The miner’s main exploration project has been described by the company’s Chairman as a “geologist’s dream” and the equivalent of “prime real estate on Park Avenue”.Story continuesIt’s accessible year-round by well-maintained roads, with all infrastructure in place, a real rarity in the mining industry. Nearly all discoveries in Canada’s critical metals market have been made in extremely remote areas. But at the Case Lake prospect, not only is all the road and electrical infrastructure already in place, but it even boasts cell phone signals -  a benefit that is unheard of in most mining venues.According to Power Metals, Case Lake is one of the most inexpensive properties to drill in Canada—not just because of its easy access, either. The cesium, lithium, and tantalum intersections here are in pegmatite that is exposed on the surface and running so shallow that it is less than 50 meters deep in various areas.It’s a story that seems to keep getting better.An Australian AdvantageAccording to PowerMetals, Case Lake has high-grade cesium that is similar to Australia’s famous Sinclair Mine.That fact becomes increasingly interesting when you look at the experts and money backing this up-and-coming Canadian miner.When the Chinese companies were forced out of their interests in Canada, big Australian money and expertise jumped at the opportunity to secure a potential critical minerals mine.And when you add Australian cesium development expertise to what looks like a very promising potential for a mine, everything can fall into place.Australia's first commercial cesium mine, Sinclair, extracted its last cesium in 2019. And it’s one of only three in the world. The other two are the Tanco mine in Manitoba, Canada, and the Bikita mine in Zimbabwe. Tanco shut down after the mine collapsed in 2015, and Bitika was depleted in 2018.That could make PowerMetals’ Case Lake property a very big deal. It’s also why we think Canada is adamant that China does not get its hands on what could end up being the only supply of cesium known, or left, in the world. It also has Washington’s full support as the U.S. backs any effort to overturn China’s dominance of critical mineral supply chains.The smart Australian money we are referring to is Australia’s Winsome Resources (ASX:WR1) which jumped at the opportunity to replace Chinese investors when the Canadian government issued its eviction notice in November last year due to national security concerns. The involved Chinese company was mining giant Sinomine Resource Group a multi-billion market cap Beijing based giant. The new buyer Winsome bought their stake as soon as the Canadian government demanded the divesture. Not only did Winsome purchase Sinomine’s 5.7% stake in Power Metals, but they have also since increased their stake to 10.7 % in the past couple of months.Mining The NumbersBefore discovering cesium, PowerMetals was already making waves with its lithium and tantalum discoveries. So far, it has drilled 80 holes over some 15,000 meters at Case Lake, making a significant world-class, high-grade (over 4%) lithium discovery at a very shallow, open depth. Just a preview of the highlights from this discovery include:1.94% Lithium and 323.75pp Tantalum over 26 meters2.07% Lithium and 213.96pp Tantalum over 18 meters4.75 % Lithium and 396.00pp Tantalum over 2 meters1.71 % Lithium and 240.77pp Tantalum over 12 meters1.20 % Lithium and 218.68pp Tantalum over 19 metersIt was while drilling for this lithium and tantalum that Power Metals made a surprise discovery of rare cesium at Case Lake’s West Joe Dyke.This is some of the highest-grade cesium found in decades, with grades as high as 24% over good intervals.24.07% Cesium over 1 meter20.36% Cesium over 1 meter22.22% Cesium over 2 meters7.65% Cesium over 7.09 metersIt was then that a Chinese company pounced on the opportunity to acquire 5.7% of Power Metals.But now Canada has hit back - and Power Metals (TSXV:PWM,OTC: PWRMF) is ready to move.As the global war for critical minerals heats up, it is companies like PowerMetals that are able to extricate themselves from China’s influence that may have the most to gain.Other companies battling it out for metal dominance:Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: SCCO), hailing from Phoenix, Arizona, is a key player in the world's copper production landscape, owing to its status as one of the largest integrated producers. The firm, which is a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico, has a wealth of reserves in its portfolio, including molybdenum, zinc, silver, lead, and gold. Given the burgeoning demand for copper in the renewable energy and electric vehicle industries, Southern Copper's prospects seem promising.The corporation's strong record of production growth and operational efficiency are indeed commendable, adding to its lure for investors. What's more, for those seeking a steady stream of income, Southern Copper's consistent track record of dividend payouts serves as a significant draw.However, it's not all smooth sailing. Like any major mining operation, Southern Copper is not immune to challenges. The company has faced backlash over environmental concerns, and disruptions to operations pose a risk. Potential investors should bear these points in mind when contemplating an investment in Southern Copper.Compass Minerals International (NYSE: CMP), operating out of Overland Park, Kansas, is a significant force in the supply of essential minerals. With an array of products that include salt, sulfate of potash, and magnesium chloride, the company caters to various markets like agriculture, consumer deicing, water conditioning, and multiple industrial applications.The strength of Compass Minerals lies in its diversified product range, solid market position, and consistent cash flow generation. It becomes an interesting consideration for potential investors owing to its balanced portfolio and commitment to sustainable operational excellence.However, prospective investors should note that Compass Minerals' performance is subject to weather conditions and the volatility of commodity prices. Milder winters can adversely affect the demand for their deicing products, a factor to consider when evaluating an investment.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX), headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, ranks amongst the world's leading mining companies. It boasts an impressive array of reserves comprising copper, gold, and molybdenum. Its most significant asset includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits, and extensive mining operations in the Americas.The rise of renewable energy and electric vehicle technologies has positioned copper as a crucial material. As a significant player in copper mining, Freeport-McMoRan stands to gain from this trend. Additionally, the company's sound operational performance and commitment to reducing debt make it an attractive investment prospect.However, there are regulatory and political challenges associated with the company's operations in certain regions. Its Indonesian operations have faced regulatory changes and environmental controversies. While Freeport-McMoRan has taken measures to manage these issues, they highlight the geopolitical risks tied to global mining operations.Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE: TRQ), a Canadian firm based in Vancouver, is an international mining company primarily focused on operating and further developing the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in southern Mongolia. Turquoise Hill has a 66% interest in one of the world's largest known copper and gold deposits, with the remaining stake held by the Government of Mongolia.With anticipated production ramp-up in the coming years, the Oyu Tolgoi mine offers immense growth potential. The company has been actively working on strengthening its balance sheet and enhancing its operational performance, adding to its long-term value creation proposition.However, potential investors should be aware of the company's concentrated risk profile due to its reliance on the Mongolia mine. The ongoing disputes with its largest shareholder, Rio Tinto, and the Mongolian government, could potentially impact Turquoise Hill's future performance.FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC), located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, operates globally as an agricultural sciences company. It offers innovative solutions to growers worldwide. FMC plays a significant role in the lithium market, a key component in rechargeable batteries and other high-tech applications, even though it's not a traditional mining company.FMC's dedication to innovation and sustainability is commendable. Its agricultural products significantly contribute to improving crop yield and quality, making it a key player in addressing global food security issues. FMC has seen growth owing to the strong demand for its crop protection products, driven by high commodity prices and robust agricultural market fundamentals.However, FMC spun off its lithium business into a separate publicly-traded company, Livent Corporation, in 2018. While FMC continues to be a robust and diversified company with strong growth prospects, investors specifically looking for lithium exposure would need to consider Livent or other lithium-focused companies.Livent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM) is a global leader in lithium technology. This Philadelphia-based company is a spin-off from FMC Corporation. It supplies lithium used in batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles, mobile devices, and other consumer electronics.The high-growth lithium market's increasing demand for electric vehicles makes Livent an appealing option for investors interested in green energy transition. The company's unique processing technology, focusing on high-purity lithium compounds, provides it with a competitive edge.Nonetheless, Livent's business significantly relies on the lithium market, which has seen volatility in recent years due to supply and demand dynamics. Also, Livent has substantial operations in Argentina, presenting potential geopolitical risks that prospective investors should consider.Glencore (OTC: GLNCY) is a Switzerland-based multinational that ranks among the world's largest diversified natural resource companies. Its operations span across the complete value chain, including mining, processing, refining, transportation, financing, and marketing. It offers an expansive product range including metals, minerals, energy, and agricultural products, making it a strong contender for investors looking for broad commodity market exposure.Glencore is making strategic moves to transition into a low-carbon economy, with substantial investments in cobalt and copper, both crucial metals for electric vehicle batteries. The company is also committed to carbon reduction and aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050. However, potential investors should note that Glencore, like other large mining corporations, has faced controversies over environmental impact and governance.While Glencore's stock is traded over-the-counter in the U.S., it is primarily listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It's essential for prospective investors to understand the associated risks with over-the-counter trading, such as lower liquidity and less stringent reporting requirements.Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE), a multinational corporation based in Brazil, is one of the world's leading producers of iron ore and nickel. The company's diverse operations also encompass manganese, ferroalloys, copper, bauxite, potash, kaolin, and cobalt. Being the largest logistics operator in Brazil, Vale also has a robust infrastructure for the distribution of its products.Given the surging global demand for iron ore, especially from China, Vale's vast reserves and efficient production position it well for investors interested in commodities. The company is also future-focused with investments in renewable energy projects and a stated goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.However, prospective investors should consider the risks associated with investing in Vale. The company's stock has demonstrated volatility in recent years due to disruptions in its mining operations, including the tragic dam collapse in Brumadinho, Brazil in 2019. While Vale has taken significant measures to improve safety and dam management, these incidents underline the potential risks tied to mining operations.ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT), based in Luxembourg, stands as the world's leading steel and mining company, with operations in 60 countries and an industrial footprint in 18 countries. It supplies high-quality steel in key global markets that include automotive, construction, household appliances, and packaging.Post-COVID-19, the company has demonstrated a robust recovery and has benefitted from strong global steel demand and price recovery. Recently, ArcelorMittal committed to carbon-neutral steelmaking in Europe by 2050 and launched XCarb™, an initiative that aims to progress towards carbon-neutral steel. This innovative step positions ArcelorMittal favorably to potential investors seeking sustainability-focused holdings.However, the cyclical nature of the steel industry and its sensitivity to global economic conditions should be factored into any investment decision. While ArcelorMittal's growth plans and commitment to sustainability are positive indicators, the inherent volatility of the steel market necessitates careful consideration.Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), a top-tier mining and metals organization, has a reputation for efficient operations and a dedication to sustainable practices. This UK-Australian multinational conducts business in approximately 35 nations worldwide and possesses considerable resources across a variety of commodities such as aluminum, copper, diamonds, coal, iron ore, and uranium. Supported by favorable market conditions, especially within copper and iron ore sectors, Rio Tinto's formidable portfolio presents an enticing opportunity for prospective investors.Recently, Rio Tinto has amplified its efforts within the renewable energy industry. It's investing heavily in technologies designed to reduce carbon emissions and is proactively participating in the production of materials crucial to the renewable energy sector, including copper and lithium. With its robust financial performance, characterized by substantial profit margins and an appealing dividend yield, Rio Tinto could be an attractive option for investors seeking a regular income stream.Despite its strengths, Rio Tinto has faced backlash over certain environmental and indigenous rights issues, the most prominent being the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves in Western Australia. Such occurrences underscore the need for investors to weigh ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors in addition to financial aspects when assessing potential investment opportunities.By.

If you want to skip our analysis of the natural resources industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Buy. Despite the fact that technology is king these days, humankind is reaching for the stars, and an infinite amount of information is available in the palm of the hand, the simple fact is that natural resources are the dominant factor that has contributed to progress.The world's cars run on fossil fuels, computers, and gadgets rely on copper, minerals, and other natural resources, and construction relies on lumber to build a large number of buildings. And even though renewable energy is all the buzz these days, petroleum products are still the go to choice for generating electricity and running airplanes and cars. The world's infrastructure is dependent on natural resources, and at least for the near term future, they are here to stay.This need for natural resources became even clearer in 2022 in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are two integral suppliers of gas, commodities, and other agricultural products. A conflict between the two shook up global supply chains for these valuable products. These effects were felt especially in Europe which had come to rely on cheap Russian gas to keep inflation down and fuel economic growth. The sum of the invasion's effects on the stock market involved primarily the shares of energy companies soaring at a time when their technology peers tanked. This share price growth also reaped dividends in literal form for investors, with Bloomberg reporting that during the three weeks that ended in September 2022 alone, energy companies paid out a massive $16.4 billion in dividends to mark a 15% sequential growth over the second quarter.Yet, natural resources also confer countries a predetermined advantage, unlike say innovation, which can surface in any country if the right conditions are in place. This also leaves some countries better off than others, and this dominance remains stable over the course of the years unless dramatic new discoveries are made. Our research of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources confirms this fact, as some of the largest countries in the world are also the richest. The top three countries are Russia, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia, with each having copious amounts of minerals, gas, and oil.Story continuesBuilding on this, the natural resources industry is also quite lucrative. One important natural resource industry is the mining sector. Research shows that this sector was worth $1.84 trillion in 2021 and was slated to grow to $2 trillion in 2022 to mark a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. As opposed to some industries where the growth rate slows down over the passage of time, the case is the opposite in the mining industry which is slated to exhibit a CAGR of 12.9% to be worth $3.36 trillion by 2026. Naturally, this makes mining companies quite lucrative, with BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Glencore being the top three most valuable mining companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Moving towards one of the most important industries in the world, namely the energy industry, shows that this sector is worth trillions of dollars. For instance, the crude oil market alone was worth $2.7 trillion last year and is slated to grow to $2.9 trillion by the end of this year. From then on until 2027, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to be worth $3.7 trillion by then. For more details on the energy industry, be sure to check out Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World.Some top energy companies that we have identified are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL). Combining these with the top mining companies named above lets us see what's going on in the industry right now. For instance, Shell announced in March that in addition to fueling gasoline vehicles, it will now also power electric cars after having completed the acquisition of Volta Inc in the U.S. This provides Shell access to a network of 3,000 charging points all over America, in more than 30 states as well as providing it the potential to expand this network by adding another 3,400 charging points. Taking a look at mining, BHP took the lead on the artificial intelligence front, when it announced in May that it has teamed up with Microsoft to use artificial intelligence and machine learning at the world's largest copper mine in Chile. Through this, the mining giant aims to improve production, contractor performance, and copper recovery from the site.As to what's on the minds of the companies themselves, here's what the management of Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:Following these principles, we’ve successfully won and advanced many clean energy projects, of which I’d like to highlight just a few. The left side represents projects currently under construction. These are projects with executed contracts, fixed payments and incremental growth with predictable returns. With project CapEx of just under $2 billion, including the new OCI project in Texas, where Linde will supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen by capturing CO2 for underground sequestration through our partner, ExxonMobil. Currently, this project makes up the majority of clean energy projects in our backlog since most electrolyzer investments are designated for the merchant market and therefore, considered base CapEx. There are a few projects like the recently announced Evonik agreement that meet backlog criteria.But even here, we support local network and supply high-purity clean hydrogen to electronics and other industrial customers as well. Currently, we view these electrolysis — electrolyzer projects as modules in our local supply network for supply of merchant hydrogen. They’re often integrated into our existing hydrogen network, sometimes side by side leveraging the same storage and transportation infrastructure, helping optimize distribution costs. Furthermore, these projects leverage various electrolyzer technologies, including PEM and outline to provide the best fit to customer needs. Sale of Plug is another avenue for Linde to participate in growth opportunities, which may have different customer demands or which may not benefit from integration with our existing supply network.With these details in mind let's take a look at some great natural resources stocks, out of which the notable names are Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).12 Best Natural Resources Stocks to BuyOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best natural resources stocks to buy based on hedge fund sentiment, we first narrowed down the top mining, forestry, and oil companies by market capitalization.

If you want to skip our analysis of the market that sees how major and mega cap stocks have dominated this year, head on over to 5 Best Major Stocks to Buy Now. 2023 has been the year of major stocks. Mega cap stocks such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have led the stock market in returns and as a result, have pushed the broader market into positive territory. To understand how, consider the fact that year to date, the three firm's shares have appreciated by 34.40%, 129%, and 53.9%, respectively. On the other side, the NASDAQ Composite index which is made of nearly all the stocks on the NASDAQ market is up by 33% year to date while the NASDAQ 100 index made of the largest non financial firms listed on the NASDAQ, is up by 40%.This surge in the fortune of technology companies is on the back of the biggest technology booms in recent history, namely artificial intelligence. Commonly called AI, artificial intelligence is simply advanced mathematics that is used to generate new outcomes or predictions based on patterns observed in previously known data sets. The biggest winner by far due to AI is none other than the semiconductor firm NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA designs and sells graphics processing units (GPUs) which are used to power up AI systems such as the popular ChatGPT platform. As its reward, investors have piled into NVIDIA's shares, with the stock up a whopping 196% year to date, having added nearly $281 to its current share price of $424.

For instance, Meta's founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is one of the youngest billionaires in the world, added $58.9 billion to his net worth, while Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s chief Mr. Elon Musk led the list of growth in riches as he saw his net worth grow by nearly a $100 billion. Tesla's shares are up by ~159% year to date, making it rank second only to NVIDIA when it comes to share price outperformance by major companies and stocks.Story continuesBut what about the future? After all, one of the most common mantras on the market is that 'past performance is not indicative of future returns.' Well, on this front, one strategy to study stock market movement is called trend analysis. This involves graphing out previous share price movements and using these to compute probabilities to guess what might take place in the future. These trends analyze investor sentiment on a mass scale and can help analyze whether market sentiment in a stock will sustain. If you're interested in learning more details about this, take a look at 10 Momentum Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.On this front, one of the pros in technical investment, Katie Stockton had some crucial insights to share in an interview with CNBC where she pointed out when her firm was able to guess that the S&amp;P500 index would soar to the heights that is today - fueled of course by mega cap stocks. She shared:You know, when we got the breakout, that's what changed things, in mid May we had the breakout above the 4,155. We were working under the assumption that that range [4,000] would hold and of course it did not. . .We're always just trying to put odds in our favor. Nobody knows what's gonna, you know, be the next month or the next year even. But we're trying to make sure that we have momentum gauges on our side, relative strength on our side, we want to make sure there's no big overbought/sell signals. So that's our charge. We wanna make sure that we have those things supporting the market. And when we do, we're bullish. When we don't, we shift back to bearish bias.So the breakout did yield an objective of about 4,510. That's also aligned with the resistance level through the Fibonacci retracements. So that would be a natural pace for a pullback to unfold more than what we've already seen. And yet, as long as the momentum is there, and as long as we don't have any big overbought sell signals, which we don't at this time, we want to stay with the bullish bias until it proves us otherwise until we see that loss of momentum. Because I think that this market is probably a very long term trading range. If you look at the monthly gauges, you'll see that they tend to flatten out. You look forward a couple of years. So to me, within that context, they have to have an intermediate term focus on momentum, and when we don't have that intermediate term momentum benefiting the market, we wanna be managing risk of course.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top major stocks to buy. Among these, some that are likely to catch your attention are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc.
