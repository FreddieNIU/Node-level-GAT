ArcelorMittal also expects its steel shipments to grow by roughly 5% year over year in 2023.While real consumption growth is anticipated to remain lackluster in the United States, the expected end of destocking is predicted to lead to a rise in apparent consumption by 1.5-3.5% in 2023.The company envisions a modest decline in real demand this year in Europe. However, it expects apparent demand to recover by 0.5-2.5% in 2023.ArcelorMittal also expects a strong recovery in economic growth in China in 2023 as COVID-19 restrictions are being lifted. However, factoring in the sustained softness in real estate during the year, it projects steel consumption to stabilize in 2023 (+1% to -1%) with potential upside dependent on China government’s infrastructure stimulus.The company also expects positive free cash flow generation in 2023.

4,d667d5bc-ac79-3cc9-b719-a7df285e06e4,NUE,2023-02-14,3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks to Buy as Markets Remain Choppy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-momentum-anomaly-stocks-buy-133901799.html,1676295541,STORY,"['NUE', 'VRTV']","[The equity markets witnessed intense volatility in the past few trading sessions driven by mixed signals from the Fed that led to ambiguity and failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy. Although the Fed raised the interest rates by 25 basis points, much akin to the broader expectations, it kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. The economic growth is also expected to remain subdued in 2023.With uncertainty becoming the norm of the day, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Nucor Corporation NUE, Veritiv Corporation VRTV and O-I Glass, Inc. OI are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.Story continuesScreening ParametersPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are three of the eight stocks that made it through this screen:Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, Nucor is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck and cold-finished bars in the United States.

5,6d885381-d0df-3891-9ba4-c2ff234a3f3d,TMO,2023-02-14,Those who invested in Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) five years ago are up 180%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-thermo-fisher-scientific-130029370.html,1676379629,STORY,['TMO'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) which saw its share price drive 177% higher over five years. In the last week shares have slid back 1.4%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Thermo Fisher Scientific achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 23% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Thermo Fisher Scientific's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Thermo Fisher Scientific's TSR for the last 5 years was 180%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Thermo Fisher Scientific shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 3.5% over one year. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 23% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Thermo Fisher Scientific  that you should be aware of.But note: Thermo Fisher Scientific may not be the best stock to buy.

6,9c5c337e-aafd-3815-af3b-efab9de87b3b,USB,2023-02-14,Why U.S. Bancorp (USB) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-u-bancorp-usb-top-164504648.html,1676306704,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.U.S. Bancorp in FocusBased in Minneapolis, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 11.67%. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.48 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.94%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.06% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.58%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 2.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, U.S. Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.58%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, U.S. Bancorp's payout ratio is 43%, which means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, USB expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.03 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 13.03%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, USB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

What he received in return was much more, due to the expertise and resources provided by Business Access Advisor (BAA) Micae Brown.""Working with Micae has been one of the best things that happened to me in the past year,"" said Cannon. ""She has given me a lot of insight into how I can grow my business.""Brown is one of nine BAAs working with the Black community in strategic cities across the country, helping redefine how U.S. Bank serves diverse communities. The BAA role was created in November 2021 as part of U.S. Bank Access Commitment™, a long-term framework with multiple initiatives, including Access Business and the creation of BAAs, as well as Access Home, which focuses on closing the homeownership gap where disparities are the largest. BAAs are responsible for addressing the three most prominent gaps that limit business growth and employment opportunities: information, connections and capital.""Melvin originally came to us looking to access capital for his luxury car service,"" Brown said. ""Fast forward and I later assisted Melvin with acquiring new customers by creating custom emails for marketing, updating marketing collateral, assisting with completing RFPs, and providing strategic introductions to other potential partners.""Cannon is one of more than 1,000 business owners served by U.S. Bank BAAs in 2022. Considering that the BAAs have been in their roles 15 months or less, the impact is evident, leading to recognition in Little Rock by the Small Business Administration and much more.""Providing knowledgeable professionals who are culturally in sync with the issues minority- and women-owned small businesses face is a qualitative and quantitative resource unique to U.S. Bank,"" said Charlotte-based BAA Tamika Stafford.Each BAA has the same ultimate objective, but their work shows up in each city uniquely based on local needs and local partners. For example:Story continuesIn Chicago, Brown serves as an advisor to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Office of Minority and Economic Empowerment and the Small Business Development Center on their statewide technical assistance initiative that includes small business centers and entrepreneurship training.In Charlotte, Stafford established a relationship with the U.S. Small Business Administration's small business resource partner SCORE Charlotte through which she serves as a mentor and provides resources, tools and learning opportunities.Little Rock's Cassandra Kidd is gearing up for her second bus tour with Remix Ideas that will visit entrepreneurs and stakeholders in Northwest Arkansas. The bus tours allows Kidd to engage first-hand with entrepreneurs in each city to educate them on the available resources.Tim Farrow in the Twin Cities launched Access Commitment Live!, a series to share comprehensive and actionable strategies to help Black-owned businesses scale. It kicked off with a successful Black Business Month event and translated into bi-monthly programming and conversations.Natasha Hutson in Colorado Springs holds a strong partnership with the Colorado Springs Black Chamber of Commerce, whose members talk with her about start-up or business expansion plans. Additionally, she hosts regular financial wealth seminars.Oakland's Will Jackson is partnering with the OK Mentoring Program to serve as the primary administrator for financial literacy and is soon launching a business series open to small business owners.Delphine Pruitt in Los Angeles collaborates with Community Development Financial Institutions and nonprofit service providers to provide access to financial and advisory services.Omaha's Ashlei Spivey is focused on building the community ""ecosystem"" to support diverse entrepreneurs by strengthening relationships with the relatively few community partners targeting diverse business owners.Brandon Willis in Denver collaborates with the Denver International Airport and teaches courses on navigating finance in business to better position minority-owned businesses to earn airport contracts.Originally launched as a pilot, U.S. Bank has committed to expansion of the Access Business program. Financial education is central to the BAA role. Pruitt partnered with Los Angeles Urban League to host a series of financial workshops. A workshop attendee referred a friend who needed a vehicle to expand her business. Within three days, the small business owner was approved for a loan and other tools/resources to grow and fuel her dreams.""This is just one example of how I've enjoyed the opportunity to engage stakeholders and Black business owners to help grow and sustain their business,"" said Pruitt. ""The impact of COVID-19 caused immense financial distress for small businesses across the country. Black business ownership declined more than 40%, the largest drop across any ethnic group. I'm honored to connect those business owners with resources to help them achieve their goals.""As for Cannon and his plans in Chicago, he's looking at new financial initiatives.""Small business owners want to know someone like Micae because she's resourceful in explaining how and when to take the next step. She has been a business liaison for me, but I also think of her as a friend who really cares about my business.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. United Therapeutics (UTHR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 10 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 23, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.40 a share.UTHR has an Earnings ESP figure of 6.86%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.40 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.12.UTHR is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on April 25, 2023, Edwards Lifesciences holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.61 a share 71 days from its next quarterly update.Edwards Lifesciences' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.45% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.61.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, UTHR and EW could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

We believe it will be one in which working virtually will be the new normal, at least for most of the work we lead. With this in mind, we’ve decided that even as restrictions are lifted and other groups in Walmart eventually return to their offices, we will take our time, and think about how we can invent the workspace of the future. We will have physical office space and it will be used primarily for collaboration, to sync up and strengthen camaraderie. We’ll be together, at times, and for a purpose.” —Walmart’s Global CTO Suresh Kumar in an internal memo in May 2020More companies want remote workers to come to officeWalmart is the latest corporate giant to mandate work-from-the-office days, and that’s increasingly becoming the norm. Workers have been reluctant about giving up their newfound work-life balance and savings on gasoline for commutes. However, managers like to have their teams assemble in person for better training and team bonding.Last year, Google, Salesforce, Twitter, and others started calling people into the workplace for a few days in the week at least. Starting September, Apple asked employees to work from an office three days a week. Since November, Uber has designated Tuesdays and Thursdays as “anchor days” when employees must come to the office.This January, Starbucks told corporate workers to come to the office three times a week by the end of the month. And most recently, Walt Disney said workers would have to come to the office four days a week starting in March.Related stories🤖 Does Walmart have a future as a tech company?🤝 Covid crushed company culture—but something better will take its place🫡 Five telltale signs you need a ‘chief remote officer’More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

In an internal memo seen by the Wall Street Journal, Walmart chief technology officer Suresh Kumar said that the retail giant’s technology workers will be asked to work in person at least two days a week.But there’s an added catch. Kumar also announced that Walmart would be closing its offices in Austin; Carlsbad, Calif.; and Portland, Ore. Affected workers would either have to move closer to one of Walmart’s remaining primary offices, such as its headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.—or leave the company.The memo reportedly said that the company would pay severance to those who chose to leave rather than relocate, and that it would cover the costs of those who decided to transfer. The company has not set a timeline for the relocation, reports Reuters.Walmart did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment, though the company told the Wall Street Journal that some relocated employees will be allowed to become full-time remote workers.Workers who decide to move to Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville may be in for a rude surprise. The company has required most employees in its head office to work in person five days a week since last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Last year, Walmart announced that it would hire 5,000 more technology workers and open offices in Atlanta and Toronto. After the recently announced closures, the company will have 14 technology hubs remaining, primarily in the U.S., but also in Mexico, Costa Rica, and India.In-office trendMany large companies are starting to demand workers come into the office at least part of the week. Last November, Snap announced that it would ask its employees to come into the office at least 80% of the time, starting this February. In January, both Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and Disney CEO Bob Iger asked employees to come into the office for most of the week.Story continuesWalmart cut around 200 corporate staff members last October, after warning that consumers were scaling back their spending due to inflation. But the company is also facing a tight labor market for hourly workers, and it raised its minimum hourly pay from $12 to $14 earlier this year.Walmart reported $158 billion in quarterly revenue in November 2022, a 3.9% year-on-year increase. At the time, the company warned of slower spending due to “persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables.” The company is expected to report both current-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 21.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Josh Schafer has been tracking the latest in that space. And, Josh, we're expecting big numbers. What are we seeing?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, so big numbers. They really did come to what we were looking for here. And so, kind of, we don't have all the numbers yet. It's still a little early as far as how much did these companies make, how much was fully bet from a dollar amount? But what we do have that we can look at is geo comply data.So you've heard a couple people talking about this today. And what that is is it is the platform that checks your location when you sign into a sportsbook. So it is not how many bets, but it is when you check in, and it makes sure you're in a legal area. And so they recorded over 100 million geolocation checks on Saturday and Sunday.- Wow.JOSH SCHAFER: To put it in perspective, that's up 25% year-over-year, so 25% more people checking in. And what you're seeing here now, this is State Farm Stadium specifically. So they have this cool little video you can see where you can see people checking in. And you obviously see it gets bigger as it gets closer to game time. That video starts at about 10:00 AM on Sunday and went through the end of the game.They saw over 100,000 check-ins at the stadium yesterday. So we had talked about that on Friday, guys, you know, how many people are gonna be live betting during this game? And it seems like there was quite a few people, Dave, that got excited like I did when Patrick Mahomes got hurt and might've hopped on it.- Touche.JOSH SCHAFER: You know?- Nice play there.[GIGGLING]- Is there any way to track who might have been the winner of these platforms, DraftKings, or FanDuel, or BetMGM, and so forth?Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: So we can certainly know that later this week, New York, for example, will have their numbers out on Friday. We'll know concretely who literally made the most money. Right now, I know FanDuel is telling me that at one point, one point last night, 50,000 bets per minute was their peak, per minute--- Wow.JOSH SCHAFER: --fielding 50,000 bets per minute. And from my knowledge, I didn't hear of any outages either, which I think is, perhaps, the most impressive part of that number, right?- You're right. You're right. When you really think about--JOSH SCHAFER: I was on the apps a lot of the night. of the And they were working [INAUDIBLE].- --fielding 50,000, I was sort of just checking them to see if they were all working. And they were. And then-- you know, just to see if they were working.- 50,000 a minute?I wanted see if they were working. 50,000 bets per minute was the peak.- Wow. You're right. Then FanDuel also saying that they had more than 2 million active players bet throughout the game, so pretty eye-popping numbers there as far as how many people were on the bet-- were on the apps. We'll find out again later this week exactly what the numbers were on how much those people were betting and how much they won.- Yeah. A BetMGM spokesman called it the most successful Super Bowl and the most bet-on single game sporting event ever, for some context. While on the subject of sports gambling, the most hyped up ad campaign leading into Super Bowl LVII was FanDuel's Kick of Destiny, Starring legendary Patriots tight end, Rob Gronkowski. But did it live up to the buzz to all this hype? You be the judge.- Rob Gronkowski kicking for $10 million, his trainer, Adam Vinatieri, with the Gronkowski family, looking on. Here we go. The kick is up.- Yeah!ROB: No!- It's no good, he missed it!- So that was a shank. And I'm not talking about the kick. I'm talking about the ad. My wife turned to me and she said, is that the ad you were excited to see? It was supposed to be live. It certainly didn't feel like it. There was no buildup. It really did not deliver. Or am I wrong, guys?- No, you are spot on--- (CHUCKLING) Oh, OK.- --at least from my perspective. What do you think? You're right. Think the hardest part about that ad, like you said, Dave, as far as the live aspect goes, is it-- when you go to a remote location like this, it just doesn't quite look live, whether it is or isn't. I-- You need to be on the field if you're gonna do a live ad. Because you're trying to get your attention.- We all sort of pop our heads up and we're like, oh, it's the FanDuel ad, oh, OK. Now, I do think from a business perspective, I think you could still argue they win, in the sense of they're giving everyone the money still. They still gave out $17 million worth of free play. I think customers are happy. So maybe you didn't get new people excited, your wife wasn't overly excited about the ad.[LAUGHTER]But I think there are plenty of people sitting with some credit on FanDuel that are excited to go and use it. And that's sort of the point of the ad.- Yeah, of course, now could be the win. And that would probably be the angle that FanDuel goes with. But even just the angle that we were looking at for the kick. I couldn't even tell, and I watched it back, what, 10 times this morning. I still wasn't sold, until you freeze that exact frame that I could see that it actually kicked-- from my perspective, I actually thought he made it. It just shows how they missed the mark. They could have had another angle there with the camera, lots of hype going into it. I don't know. Didn't do it for me.- It was a great plan.- It was. It certainly drummed up a lot of the hype ahead of the game.- Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: Right.- But did it deliver? It just went wide left.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, maybe if Gr-- maybe Gronk needs to be a better kicker.- Eh.JOSH SCHAFER: I [INAUDIBLE] could have better angle, I agree on better angle, better angle.- I don't think the make would have changed it. It was the feel, the buildup. They need a reporter live.- And you couldn't even see it.- I need Kay Adams there on the field broadcasting. But anyway, we won't--JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe we'll produce it next year.- (GIGGLING) [INAUDIBLE]- Next year, give me a call, OK, FanDuel? Thank you.- Oh, my goodness. Appreciate it, Josh.- All right--- Anyhow, give me a call.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: MercadoLibre Inc. MELI, Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, United Rentals Inc. URI, Chewy Inc. CHWY and Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy Stocks Flying High Year to Date with More UpsideU.S. stock markets are rallying this year despite occasional fluctuations. Although it is too early to take a decision, market participants have regained confidence in risky assets like equities to some extent after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have rallied 1.7%, 6.3% and 12.6%, respectively.This trend is expected to continue as the rate of inflation and consequently the magnitude of the Fed's interest rate hike has declined. Buoyed by the early 2023 rally, several stocks have popped. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong upside left.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.""Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell's recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Story continuesPeak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.U.S. Economy Is CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter's growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy will expand by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities are the primary reasons for job cuts. Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the U.S. labor market remains resilient. Nonfarm payrolls in January came in at 517,000 well above the consensus estimate of 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, below the consensus mark of 3.6%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have rallied more than 20% year to date.

The bottom line compared unfavorably with $1.03 per share earned in the year-ago quarter. Shares of HMN lost 0.2% in the last three trading sessions, reflecting the soft performance.The quarter suffered due to the disappointing results of the P&amp;C segment, given inflationary pressures resulting in higher loss costs.

The segment contributed 47% to the total revenues in 2022.The core loss totaled $25 million against a profit of $14.5 million in the year-ago quarter.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Forza Petroleum (TSE:FORZ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Forza Petroleum, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$97m ÷ (US$658m - US$89m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Forza Petroleum has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Oil and Gas industry average of 21%. See our latest analysis for Forza Petroleum roceWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you're interested in investigating Forza Petroleum's past further, check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Does the ROCE Trend For Forza Petroleum Tell Us?It's great to see that Forza Petroleum has started to generate some pre-tax earnings from prior investments. Historically the company was generating losses but as we can see from the latest figures referenced above, they're now earning 17% on their capital employed. Additionally, the business is utilizing 22% less capital than it was five years ago, and taken at face value, that can mean the company needs less funds at work to get a return. This could potentially mean that the company is selling some of its assets.Story continuesOur Take On Forza Petroleum's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Forza Petroleum has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 10.0% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Forza Petroleum, we've discovered 5 warning signs that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The current and deferred income tax effect, which ranges from 21% to 29% in all periods, was calculated by applying the subsidiaries' statutory tax rate to the pre-tax amount if deductible/taxable. Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) is based on 572 million shares for the fourth quarter of 2022, 571 million shares for the full year of 2022, 550 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 545 million for full year 2021.  Non-GAAP financial measures * Operating earnings (loss) excludes ""special items"" as described below, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management uses Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the Company's performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment to further evaluate the Company's performance by segment and references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision making. Operating earnings (loss) per share and Operating earnings (loss) per share for each segment is calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes special items as discussed herein, for the periods presented by the number of shares outstanding. Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP), as well as Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) for each segment, are based on 572 million shares for the fourth quarter of 2022, 571 million shares for the full year of 2022, 550 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, 545 million for full year 2021, 573 million shares for the first quarter of 2023 and 574 million shares for the full year of 2023. Furthermore, adjusted earnings per share are also a non-GAAP financial measure and adjust the 2021 operating earnings (loss) per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, for certain accounting policy changes, rate credits and equity financing transactions that took effect or began to impact in 2022, which management believes provides for a more consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses period-over-period. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share, Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment, and adjusted earnings per share provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company's peer group. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided, where possible without unreasonable effort, quantitative reconciliations within this presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.Investor Materials and TeleconferenceFirstEnergy's Strategic and Financial Highlights presentation and Investor Fact book are posted on the company's Investor Information website – www.firstenergycorp.com/ir.

(NYSE: FE) is once again reminding customers about the public safety risks associated with helium-filled foil balloons. While these balloons have increased in popularity as decorations, they continue to cause power outages each year when released outdoors because their metallic coating conducts electricity and poses a risk to the electric system.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""Our communities have done a great job helping us raise awareness of the dangers of power outages caused by metallic balloons, and FirstEnergy has experienced year-over-year decreases in the number of these outages as a result,"" said Lisa Rouse, director of distribution system operations at FirstEnergy. ""However, we must continue to educate people of all ages on how to use these balloons responsibly to keep electricity flowing safely and reliably year-round.""Last year, foil balloons were to blame for 102 power outages across FirstEnergy's six-state service area—an 18% decrease in balloon-related outages when compared to 2021 and a 25% decrease when compared to 2020.Due to the popularity of Valentine's Day balloons, February typically marks the onset of a dramatic increase in outages caused by adrift metallic balloons that peaks in June, when warm weather takes celebrations and picnics outdoors.To help ensure holidays and celebrations are enjoyed responsibly, customers are encouraged to keep the following balloon safety tips in mind:Use caution and avoid celebrating with metallic balloons near overhead electric lines.Securely tie helium-filled metallic balloons to a weight that is heavy enough to prevent them from floating away. Do not remove the weight until the balloons are deflated.Puncture and deflate metallic balloons once they are no longer in use because they can stay inflated for several weeks. Never release them into the sky.Never attempt to retrieve any type of balloon, kite or toy that becomes caught in a power line. Leave it alone and immediately call FirstEnergy at 888-544-4877 to report the problem.Stay far away from a downed or low-hanging power line. Always assume downed lines are energized and dangerous. Report them ASAP by calling 911.Story continues""With a little care and precaution when handling foil balloons, we can all do our part to help keep the energy alive this Valentine's Day and all year long,"" said Rouse.Visit www.firstenergycorp.com/publicsafety to learn about FirstEnergy's ""Stop.

The day after Salesforce announced the cuts, CEO Marc Benioff led an all-hands meeting to explain the company’s decision. It didn’t go well. Employees criticized Benioff for being evasive during the meeting and thrusting the Ohana idea in a call that was expected to be about job losses. Now Benioff says the call, which lasted for two hours, wasn’t the best idea. “We were trying to explain the unexplainable,” Benioff told the New York Times in an interview published Monday. “It’s hard to have a call like that with such a large group and have it be effective, and we paid a price.” That episode left some of the Salesforce employees who were spared upset and flummoxed about their role in the company; workers have flooded a Slack channel meant for employee grievances with complaints, Fortune reported earlier this month.But Benioff characterized the layoffs as a part of how Salesforce works, and that there would be no growth if the company was in a comfortable “steady state.”“I wish I offered lifetime employment,” he told the Times. “But the reality is when you have a big company with 80,000 employees, there are going to be times you have to make a headcount adjustment. Our layoff packages are some of the most generous ever.” Stewart Butterfield, former CEO of Slack, the workplace communications platform acquired by Salesforce for a whopping $28 billion during the pandemic, even acknowledged the relative generosity of the severance package compared to many other companies. It included a “longer than usual paid notice-period,” allowing bonuses to be given out and stocks to be vested to help cushion the blow. The severance package for laid-off employees included a minimum of five months’ pay.Turbulent timesSalesforce has had a turbulent few months. The company laid off hundreds of employees in November, ending a hiring run that tripled its headcount since 2017. Co-CEO Bret Taylor abruptly left the company in December after serving for just a year. Activist investors are also pressuring the company to cut costs and enact further changes. The company is undertaking an aggressive cost reduction strategy as it looks to increase profit margins and keep expenses under control. Earlier in the year, Benioff told some employees that he aims to cut between $3 billion and $5 billion in costs, and real estate would make up a “major part” of that mission. Salesforce isn’t alone in its ambition to cut costs, especially through massive layoffs. Many of its peers—including big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta—also shed large chunks of their workforce after over-hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. So far in 2023, 345 companies have laid off upwards of 103,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a layoff tracking platform.

(CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-attracting-investor-140002931.html,1676296802,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +11.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 11.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. This estimate has changed +3.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.82 indicates a change of +18.2% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $7.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9%. The $30.63 billion and $33.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.6% and +10.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.27 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 1.1% gain over the past four weeks.The stock jumped following its announcement to acquire Montreal-based industrial valves manufacturer, Velan, in an all-cash transaction for approximately $245 million. Given Velan’s strong presence in nuclear, cryogenic and defense markets, the acquisition will accelerate FLS’ Diversification, Decarbonization and Digitization (3D) strategy. The transaction is also expected to generate significant aftermarket revenue and bring synergies for FLS.Flowserve expects the transaction to generate approximately $20 million of run-rate cost synergies within two years of closing. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2023, and Velan will be a part of FLS’ Flow Control Division segment.The acquisition of Velan will help Flowserve maintain a significant presence in Québec. Upon completion, the transaction is expected to be accretive to Flowserve’s adjusted EPS in the first full year.This company that makes pumps, valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.4%. Revenues are expected to be $991.89 million, up 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Flowserve, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The Third Point Offshore Fund returned 1.2% net in the fourth quarter compared to a 7.5% return for the S&amp;P 500 INDEX (TR) and a 9.9% return for the MSCI WORLD INDEX (TR). Defensive portfolio orientation, weakness in several large positions, and write-offs/ markdowns in crypto-related private investments impacted the fund’s performance in the quarter relative to indexes. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Third Point highlighted stocks like PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in the fourth quarter investor letter.

On February 13, 2023, PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stock closed at $15.66 per share. One-month return of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) was -1.32%, and its shares gained 37.37% of their value over the last 52 weeks. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) has a market capitalization of $33.241 billion.Third Point made the following comment about PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“As we enter our fifth year as investors in PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), first as bondholders and then as shareholders, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the company’s potential. Even with a 63% increase in the share price over the past six months, we believe the Company remains significantly undervalued with a risk-reward skewed almost entirely to the upside. Patti Poppe is one of the most talented CEOs in America today and we expect her team will be able to consistently deliver on their 10% medium term earnings growth forecast. In addition to improved management execution, this trajectory is significantly de-risked by supportive legislative initiatives (a 10-year undergrounding plan and extension of Diablo Canyon) and improving regulatory certainty via positive cost of capital adjustments and the 2023 General Rate Case.By 2024, earnings should grow to at least $1.34. Using a conservative 16x multiple on forward earnings (vs. 18x for the group) implies a $21.50 target price by the end of this year. Shareholders will also benefit from an expected reinstatement of a dividend in the middle of 2023. This should serve as a catalyst for increased institutional ownership, similar to the dynamics around the Company’s inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 Index in September 2022. Finally, investors are becoming more comfortable with the reduction in the Fire Victims’ Trust ownership stake, which now accounts for only 9% of shares outstanding. The reduction from an original position of 24% occurred with limited market impact and we expect the remainder of the position will be exited by the end of this year, clearing that overhang.”Story continuesPixabay/Public DomainPG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

The electrification project represents an important milestone for PG&amp;E's Electric Vehicle (EV) Fleet Program, expanding the program's support of transportation electrification to include the marine sector.The Angel Island ferry plans to operate as California’s first zero-emission, electric propulsion short-route ferry beginning in 2024""The Angel Island ferry is an important part of California history and Bay Area tourism, carrying hundreds of thousands of visitors to Angel Island State Park for nearly a half-century.

54,5f0c628f-a06d-3b6b-a49e-f6d0ae03121a,MRO,2023-02-14,Marathon (MRO) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-mro-report-q4-earnings-130801499.html,1676293681,STORY,['MRO'],"[Marathon Oil Corporation MRO is set to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 82 cents per share on revenues of $1.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent oil and gas producer’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at MRO’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based upstream player beat the consensus mark on stronger liquid realizations and solid domestic production. MRO had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Revenues of $2.2 billion generated by the firm also came in 8.6% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Marathon beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 13.9%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the last seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 6.5% increase year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 4.7% decline from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderMarathon is likely to have cashed in on the strength in hydrocarbon realizations. In the previous three-month period, MRO’s key U.S. E&amp;P segment realized average liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $93.67 per barrel — significantly higher than the year-earlier level of $69.40. Additionally, average realized natural gas prices were up 88% year over year to $7.84 per thousand cubic feet.The increase in price is most likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, with commodity prices remaining high on the back of geopolitical tensions, strained supply and robust demand. This price boost is likely to have buoyed the fourth-quarter revenues and cash flows of Marathon.MRO is also expected to have benefited from higher production during the December period. In the third quarter of 2022, the company’s net production from the domestic unit averaged 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). Considering MRO’s impressive production profile from its high-margin U.S. resource plays (Eagle Ford, Bakken, Oklahoma and Permian), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter volume is pegged at some 290,000 BOE/d, indicating continued strength from the September quarter.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in Marathon’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. MRO’s total costs in the third quarter were $1.1 billion, $37 million higher than the prior-year period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the third quarter due to cost inflation and higher energy prices.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

Aggregate inflows into the U.S. stock market, though concentrated in a few names, has reached levels last seen in 2020-21, according to Vanda Research.Shares of companies linked to artificial intelligence have soared after U.S. firm OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, a chatbot that gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries, snagged a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp.Meme stocks have clawed back some of last year's losses, while shares of larger, tech-focused companies such as Nvidia and Tesla have also joined in the fray.The Nasdaq Composite Index, home of many smaller, more speculative companies as well as the megacaps, is up 13% this year, after a 33% loss in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 index is up about 7%.""We've definitely seen risk appetites return to equity markets this year,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.AI BOOMCompanies building artificial intelligence tools have been among the rally's biggest winners, a move market observers say has been driven in part by retail investors.Big gainers include shares in analytics firm BigBear.ai , which are up 500% this year, and chipmaker Nvidia , up 50%. Meanwhile, Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft jostle to pull ahead in the race for the next big growth driver.Five of the largest Artificial Intelligence ETFs, which offer exposure to firms involved in the development and production of robots or artificial intelligence, have grown assets to $4.27 billion, up 18% this year, compared with a 10% rise in assets for the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ ETF .Story continuesMeanwhile, shares of early meme stocks GameStop and AMC Entertainment have pared some losses after last year's tumble.Not all meme stocks are thriving, however: shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which soared as much as 180% in early February, have retreated to trade down 19% for the year as investors await details on whether the struggling retailer can avoid bankruptcy.CONDITIONS TIGHTMany market participants are quick to draw contrasts between the current rally in speculative names and meme stocks' initial surge in 2021.One key comparison is bond yields, which now offer increased competition to stocks after hitting multi-year highs in 2022 as the Fed tightened monetary policy. Investors have recently recalibrated how high the Fed might raise rates this year amid signs of a stronger-than-expected job market.""The current state of play is undoubtedly more challenging,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note on Thursday.The Fed's rate-hiking campaign has tightened financial conditions relative to two years ago, with the Chicago Fed's U.S. National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) at -0.36, compared to -0.62 in 2021, signaling tighter financial conditions.OPTIONS ACTIONThe return to risk-taking is showing up in record trading volumes in the U.S. options market.Demand for calls, which convey the right to buy stock at a fixed price in the future, has outstripped puts, typically used for bearish wagers, with 1.15 calls traded for every put over the last month, per Trade Alert data.Still, that measure is not as euphoric as in 2021, when it reached a high of two calls traded for every put.SHORTS TAKE AIMWhile retail traders may be rushing in, short sellers - who aim to profit by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back later at a lower price - have been adding to their bets, particularly in the AI space.""Investor enthusiasm is also attracting short-sellers that are skeptical about some of the resulting valuations,"" said Evan Niu, an analyst at Ortex, which tracks real-time short interest data.Short interest for C3.ai stands near an 8-month high of 19%. AI software firm Veritone, SoundHound and BigBear.ai also show a pick up in short interest, Ortex data showed.At the same time, short sellers are digging in their heels on their bets against Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, with short interest at a near 6-month high of 48.6%, per Ortex data.(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Nick Zieminski)]"

But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), since the last five years saw the share price fall 48%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.In the last half decade Walgreens Boots Alliance saw its share price fall as its EPS declined below zero. The recent extraordinary items contributed to this situation. At present it's hard to make valid comparisons between EPS and the share price. But we would generally expect a lower price, given the situation.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Walgreens Boots Alliance's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Walgreens Boots Alliance's TSR for the last 5 years was -38%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 8.8% in the twelve months, Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders did even worse, losing 20% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 7% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Walgreens Boots Alliance better, we need to consider many other factors.

65,61927bed-da0a-416b-a054-4ee3e74c85d7,WBA,2023-02-14,Why you should care about CVS acquiring Oak Street Health,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-you-should-care-about-cvs-acquiring-oak-street-health-221052049.html,1676326252.0,STORY,"['OSH', 'CVS', 'ONEM', 'WBA', 'AMZN', 'CI', 'UNH']","[CVS's (CVS) announcement of its $10.6 billion deal for Oak Street Health (OSH) is just the latest example of how major health-care players are slowly expanding their reach throughout different segments of the industry.In the past two decades, CVS has acquired an insurance company (Aetna), a pharmacy benefits manager (Caremark), launched its Minute Clinic, and is now expanding into more clinical care services. In addition, it is pursuing a strategy to help to diversify clinical trials.All the major health care companies are in some way pursuing what is known as ""vertical integration,"" or combining their business with other segments of the health industry.Take for example the biggest commercial insurer, United Healthcare (UNH). It has the Optum brand, a pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare provider used in physician's offices, and OptumRx which helps United compete in the pharmacy benefits space.Experts have ongoing worries about the impact of these behemoth companies, especially the quality of care received by patients.But there may not be enough data yet to determine if the benefits — ideally lower costs and better patient adherence to care plans — outweigh the risks of more centralized industry control.A logo outside an Oak Street Health urgent care center is pictured after CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) announced it will buy Oak Street Health Inc (OSH.N) for about $9.5 billion in cash, in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., February 8, 2023. REUTERS/Mike SegarIn a separate, recent report from the New England Journal of Medicine's Catalyst group, CVS chief medical officer Dr. David Fairchild said the pandemic showed patients' affinity for convenience in health care.""I think the health care industry still needs to focus on how to make health care more convenient and accessible because this is what people want and need,"" Fairchild said.Oak Street Health, whose patients are older adults, is focused on a type of payment model that has been long-discussed but which has never taken off in a big way: value-based care.This, according to health economist Craig Garthwaite, is key.""If people have always said the problem with U.S. health care is the fee-for-service system where we don't really have a system to buy health, we have a system to buy health care services and everyone in this system makes money when you consumer more care...this takes away that incentive,"" said Garthwaite, director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.Story continues""They make money, now that they are owned by an insurance company ... when you use less health care,"" Garthwaite explained.But despite being owned by an insurer, the company says it will remain agnostic toward insurers that reimburse it for services.CVS sees growth opportunity in Oak Street, which has already been able to scale to 169 clinics and is expected to reach 300 by 2026. CVS benefits from the transaction as it can contribute to Oak Street patient growth through its channels, as well as driving greater utilization of CVS pharmacy and Caremark, according to CFO Shawn Guertin during a recent earnings call.""There's obviously things we can do for plan design offerings to highlight the Oak network or the Oak clinics. We can do that with the Aetna members. I mentioned Signify before as a potential sort of source of members, but when you just think about the vast array of members that we interact with and the vast array of seniors that we interact with every year, across this company, this is a much wider catch basin if you will for potential growth,"" Guertin said.Analysts have hailed the move, even while criticizing the price tag.David Larsen, an analyst at BTIG, said in a note that this new primary care business, along with its recent acquisition of Signify, makes CVS ""one of the most dominant forces in health care services.""Larsen noted that while the transaction has been talked about for a while — CVS said it had been doing due diligence for 15 months prior — he was ""somewhat surprised at the pace with which the market is moving"" with regard to primary care acquisitions.Cigna (CI) and Walgreens (WBA) recently invested in VillageMD, and Walgreens is acquiring Summit Health for $8.9 billion, while Amazon (AMZN) acquired One Medical (ONEM).Scott Dunn, lead healthcare analyst at CB Insights said major health-care brands like CVS are no longer simply insurers or drug store chains.""These moves demonstrate the continued push by many high-profile pharmacies into fast-growing healthcare markets such as senior care, primary care, and home health,"" Dunn said in a recent note.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

WBA is gaining from continued partnership growth and a strong focus on strategic execution. The company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings. The company’s long-term growth model looks encouraging. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 22.9% compared with a 16.3% fall of the industry and a 8.7% plunge of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $31.52 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 4.72% on average. However, the company’s long-term projected growth rate of 5% remains behind the industry’s growth projection of 6.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayQ1 Upsides: Walgreens Boots exited first-quarter fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s U.S. Healthcare business grew, led by key contract wins, continued partnership growth and a strong focus on execution. The company achieved the calendar year 2022 target for co-located VillageMD clinics of 200.The company continues to play a leading role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 8.4 million vaccinations in the reported quarter. Walgreens Boots raised its U.S. Healthcare target in November, including the fiscal year 2025 sales goal to the range of $14.5-$16.0 billion, up from $11.0-$12.0 billion previously. The company raised 2023 sales guidance, reflecting continued growth momentum.New Alliances Look Strategic: The intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn November 2022, VillageMD entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Summit Health-CityMD -- a leading provider of primary, specialty and urgent care. The transaction is valued at approximately $8.9 billion, with investments from Walgreens Boots Alliance and an affiliate of Evernorth, a subsidiary of Cigna Corporation. With Investments from WBA and Evernorth, the Combined Company Will Deliver a Unique and Comprehensive Patient Experience for Optimal Individual and Community Outcomes.Story continuesLong-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging:  During the first-quarter-fiscal 2023 earnings call, Walgreens Boots noted that U.S. Healthcare targets raised with Summit Health announcement on November 7, 2022, including the fiscal year 2025 sales goal to $14.5 billion to $16.0 billion, up from $11.0 billion to $12.0 billion previously, and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the segment by the end of the fiscal year 2023.Looking beyond 2023, increased clarity into the company's long-term growth algorithm, building to low-teens adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond.DownsidesPressure on Margin Continues: In the last few years, the slowdown in the generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Of late, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margin on a significant level.Competitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds from increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has moved 0.2% down to $4.50.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $134.51 billion, suggesting a 1.4% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

67,8a13fe4c-f9b6-39da-ba72-e50f697da008,WBA,2023-02-14,3 of the Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for February,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-dividend-stocks-buy-181906432.html,1676053146.0,STORY,"['JNJ', 'WBA']","[The stock market has had a blistering start to 2023, erasing some fears that prevailed during the 2022 bear market, when dividend stocks were very popular. But we’re not out of the woods quite yet, so investors should continue to keep an eye out for the best dividend stocks.The increase in Treasury yields has made dividend stocks less attractive, since Treasuries are (generally) considered risk-free, and dividend stocks do pose considerable risk.However, that doesn’t mean we should ignore excellent dividend stocks. Let’s look at a few dividend stocks to buy in the month of February.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest Dividend Stocks for February: Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the first dividend stock that I identified for this article. The company has already reported its fourth-quarter earnings, removing a short-term risk from the equation. Second, the stock just hit a multi-month low after JNJ lost a court battle.While that’s not necessarily good news for investors, it is good news for those looking to initiate a bullish position in JNJ stock. A further decline in the stock, which has a dividend yield of 2.74%, would certainly make it even more attractive.If the shares fall into the low-$150s, where JNJ does have some nice support, the stock’s dividend yield would be close to 3%  But more importantly, consider the longevity of the company’s dividend.JNJ has continuously paid and raised its annual dividend for 60 years. That’s a rare phenomenon and worth paying attention to. Plus, the shares trade at just 15.5 times this year’s earnings, and analysts, on average, expect the drug maker’s profits to climb 4% a year this year and in 2024.Realty Income (O)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockLike J&amp;J, Realty Income (NYSE:O) has paid its dividend for an exceptionally long time.The company has given its investors a monthly dividend for more than 52 years, and it has raised its payout for more than 25 consecutive years.Story continuesLet those numbers sink in because they truly stand out in the world of publicly traded companies. When it comes to paying and raising dividends for many years, O stock is exceptional. Plus it has a solid dividend yield of 4.4%.At a time when the Federal Reserve is still raising interest rates, REIT stocks can seem like a risky choice. However, the economy continues to grow, avoiding a recession. Even if a recession does occur, investors can clearly depend on Realty Income and O stock.Best Dividend Stocks for February: Walgreens (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comFor the last stock on this list of dividend stocks to buy, I was going to pick Chevron (NYSE:CVX). It has a 3.5% dividend yield and recently announced a $75 billion share buyback plan. However, I’m going to go with Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) instead.WBA has an impressive 5.1% dividend yield and has raised its dividend for 47 consecutive years. Plus, I like Walgreens because it has a defensive, non-cyclical business.While the economy is holding up pretty well, there’s no telling when a recession can occur. If a downturn does happen, I expect Walgreens to be pretty well-insulated from it.Analysts’ average estimate does call for Walgreens’ earnings to drop in 2023. But at WAG’s current valuation, it’s hard to be too pessimistic about the stock. The shares trade at just over eight times this year’s earnings expectations. With a dividend yield north of 5%, WAG definitely seems like one of the best dividend stocks to consider.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates. Dividend-growing companies have histories of consistently increasing their dividend payments, which is particularly beneficial for income investors. Historical returns of dividend stocks have also shown that they have lower price volatility compared to non-dividend stocks.Continuous changes in monetary policies in 2022 altered investor sentiment and brought dividend securities into the limelight. Though S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% last year, dividend companies remained on strong footing, rewarding investors with stable returns. According to a report by ProShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fell by just 6.21% in 2022 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index reported a 0.11% drop, versus a harsher decline of the wider market. Similarly, Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index. These numbers show that dividend growth strategies outperformed the broader market in large-, small-, and mid-cap spaces in the US. Some companies that have consistently raised their dividends include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX).Another report by Allspring Global Investments also highlighted the positive performance of dividend stocks over time.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”13.

QuoteFactors to Note Ahead of Q1 ReleaseGrowing impact of artificial intelligence (AI), fifth-generation, the Internet of Things, high-performance computing, the Cloud and automotive is anticipated to have boosted demand for Synopsys’ advanced solutions during the first quarter fiscal 2023. The company is likely to have gained from growth in Fusion Compiler, which is fueled by the large deal wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets.During fiscal first-quarter, the increasing global design activity and customer engagements are likely to have been Synopsys’ growth drivers. Its first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for its solid product portfolio.The continuous shift to high-performance cloud computing due to the growing hybrid working environment is expected to have aided demand for the company’s Intellectual Property (IP) solutions, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express 5.0 &amp; 6.0, 800G Ethernet and DDR5 memory. Synopsys expects total non-GAAP costs and expenses in the range of $875-$885 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Strong adoption of interface and foundation IP solutions are likely to have boosted revenues for SNPS’ interface portfolio.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Intel Corporation (INTC), Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS) and FedEx Corporation (FDX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Intel have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (-41.6% vs. -14.8%). The company is facing uncertainty over the over-supplied chip markets that are weighing on its near-term outlook. More than other players in the space, the market is skeptical of Intel's ability to profitably operate and execute in this unfavorable environment. In addition, production delays remain a concern for the company.Imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden are other headwinds. It is witnessing intensifying competition in the server, networking and storage markets, while inflated raw material costs and signs of market saturation are worrisome. The Sino-US trade war is also adversely impacting its growth prospects.However, Intel is gaining rapid strides in the data center business with integrated solutions that are highly competitive in prices. The company is also focusing on developing a complete product range targeting different segments of the market.     (You can read the full research Intel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Synopsys shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+21.8% vs. -10.5%). The company is benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. Growth in hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for Synopsys’ Fusion Compiler product boosted the top line.Growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects. Rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, internet of things and big data is driving investments in new compute and machine learning architectures. Our estimates suggest that Synopsys’ revenues will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% through 2023-2025.However, Synopsys is hurting from supply-chain disruptions stemming from the pandemic. The company is also witnessing stiff competition. Geopolitical challenges coupled with uncertainties related to restrictions over trade with Huawei are other woes.(You can read the full research report on Synopsys here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of FedEx have declined -8.4% over the past year against the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry’s decline of -13.0%. The company’s volumes are being hurt due to the decline in shipping demand, particularly in Asia and Europe. Weakening of e-commerce demand as economies re-open is another concern.To navigate the weaker-than-expected business environment, FDX is actively cutting costs. FedEx anticipates generating cost savings of nearly $3.7 billion in fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2023 estimate for capital expenditure has been slashed by $400 million to $5.9 billion.However, efforts to reward shareholders of FDX, through dividends and buybacks, are encouraging as well.

Southwest Airlines executives testifying to Congress last week over a slew of canceled flights over the Christmas holidays. And we're being kind. It was an absolute meltdown. The airline has been in hot water since leaving millions of people stranded after a storm grounded planes across many airlines. Southwest was not able to recover as fast as the others. It took nearly a week, even a couple of weeks to be back up and running. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero here with more on the hearing and how Congress can help keep these executives accountable. I'm skeptical to say the least.DANI ROMERO: I think a lot of people are as well. But like you said, last week, senators really made it clear that their frustration on behalf of their constituents in regards to this holiday meltdown. And we heard from Southwest's Chief Operating Officer Andrew Waterson. He said that they are implementing steps to really ensure that this dysfunction doesn't happen again, this operational dysfunction. And so far we know, as of Friday, Southwest Airlines has rolled out their new scheduling. But the bigger issue at hand is winter resiliency. And that's going to take some time to really roll out. And so they are taking steps in regards to that.They said that they are planning to meet with airport officials from both Denver and Chicago in ways of infrastructure, like an infrastructure system when it comes to de-icing. They talked about de-icing trucks, a new system in regards to that. We'll see how that plays out. But they are willing to invest. They are expected-- excuse me-- to invest about $1.3 billion in upgrading their technology. I did speak with a senior fellow from the Brookings Institute who did testify during this congressional hearing.Story continuesAnd he said, Dani, I didn't get the gist of what really was the problem at hand. We didn't get to the heart of it. We heard aspects of where the problem could have been. But we didn't get to the anatomy, the systematic breakdown of where this dysfunction happened. And so I asked him if there would be any legislation changes. And he said, not likely. It really was senators got the chance to point the finger at Southwest.- They got their TV soundbites.DANI ROMERO: Exactly. And then from there, obviously, Southwest is under a lot of heat, and so they're trying to implement this. But who knows? This could happen a couple of months from now. It's really unclear. I mean, they're trying, obviously, to tackle the issue at hand. They're putting all these different systems in. Hopefully, we can see it.- They're captain of their pilots union told us he was very critical of the computer system and their system that links pilots to, planes saying that both are a debacle. So we hope they make those changes. Thankfully, there's no massive weather events coming. Dani Romero, thank you.]"

(NYSE:ROP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-roper-technologies-101752868.html,1676369872,STORY,['ROP'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Roper Technologies Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.87bUS$2.05bUS$2.31bUS$2.49bUS$2.63bUS$2.75bUS$2.85bUS$2.94bUS$3.03bUS$3.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.54%Est @ 4.50%Est @ 3.77%Est @ 3.26%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.1%) = US$50bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$50b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$22bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$39b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$430, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Roper Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.062. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Roper TechnologiesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Roper Technologies, we've put together three additional factors you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates. Dividend-growing companies have histories of consistently increasing their dividend payments, which is particularly beneficial for income investors. Historical returns of dividend stocks have also shown that they have lower price volatility compared to non-dividend stocks.Continuous changes in monetary policies in 2022 altered investor sentiment and brought dividend securities into the limelight. Though S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% last year, dividend companies remained on strong footing, rewarding investors with stable returns. According to a report by ProShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fell by just 6.21% in 2022 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index reported a 0.11% drop, versus a harsher decline of the wider market. Similarly, Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index. These numbers show that dividend growth strategies outperformed the broader market in large-, small-, and mid-cap spaces in the US. Some companies that have consistently raised their dividends include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX).Another report by Allspring Global Investments also highlighted the positive performance of dividend stocks over time. The report mentioned that dividend growers delivered the best risk/return relation in 30 years ending December 2020.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:We first listed down stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats group, the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. From these stocks, we shortlisted companies with dividend growth rates of at least 8% in the past 12 months. These growth rates go up to 31%, as you will see in the article. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend growth rates.Story continuesDividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates15. Caterpillar Inc.

For Q4 2022, it reported strong results with revenue of $16.6 billion, which showed a 20.3% growth from the same period last year. For FY22, the company generated $7.8 billion in operating cash flow and returned $6.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company has a strong payout ratio of 36.5%.Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.94%, as of February 13. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 28 years with a 12-month dividend growth of 8.1%.

Among these hedge funds, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”13.

82,05543157-6c63-3aa3-87a6-7de0eb44e43e,TDG,2023-02-14,What Makes TransDigm Group (TDG) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-transdigm-group-tdg-strong-170005462.html,1676307605,STORY,['TDG'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at TransDigm Group (TDG), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. TransDigm Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for TDG that show why this aircraft components maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor TDG, shares are up 2.38% over the past week while the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry is up 0.61% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.81% compares favorably with the industry's 3.66% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of TransDigm Group have risen 17.7%, and are up 14.44% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.87% and -7.76%, respectively.Investors should also take note of TDG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, TDG is averaging 379,762 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with TDG.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost TDG's consensus estimate, increasing from $21.66 to $22.04 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that TDG is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep TransDigm Group on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

89,88b7c60c-9974-3190-9f21-f437b983dc3e,GPN,2023-02-14,Is There An Opportunity With Global Payments Inc.'s (NYSE:GPN) 44% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-global-payments-inc-nyse-122755875.html,1676291275,STORY,['GPN'],"[Does the February share price for Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Global Payments The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.65bUS$2.79bUS$3.11bUS$3.89bUS$4.26bUS$4.58bUS$4.85bUS$5.07bUS$5.27bUS$5.45bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 9.69%Est @ 7.40%Est @ 5.80%Est @ 4.68%Est @ 3.90%Est @ 3.35% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.5% US$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.5%– 2.1%) = US$75bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$75b÷ ( 1 + 9.5%)10= US$30bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$55b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$118, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Global Payments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.247. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Global PaymentsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Barney, your favorite purple dinosaur will return in an animated series launching next year. In addition to new content, Mattel is turning out a new line of Barney toys, books, and accessories in 2025. Now, Barney was born way back in 1992, but has been off the air since 2010.Said Mattel global head of consumer products Josh Silverman, quote, ""Barney's message of love and kindness has stood the test of time,"" which is interesting, Seana, because before that animated series comes out next year, Peacock will debut a docuseries in October entitled, ""I Love You, You Hate Me."" No joke, that's what the docuseries will be called because so many people hate Barney.SEANA SMITH: So many people hate Barney. Or you either hate him, or you love him. I loved him. I actually tried to get-- I didn't even know about this news, and I tried to get my three-year-old to watch Barney over the weekend. He's a little young for it, but it is educational. It does get the kids' attention. I think there are a lot of reasons to like it. Do I think he does get a bit annoying sometimes? Yes, but I don't think you can go as far and say that you hate Barney. It's just a purple dinosaur after all.DAVE BRIGGS: Can you sing the jingle?SEANA SMITH: How's it go again? Try. Try. Putting you on the spot.DAVE BRIGGS: (SINGING) I love you.BOTH: You love me.SEANA SMITH: Yes, I do know.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't know the rest of it, but I know when I hear it, it makes me want to pull my hair out. So I think that docuseries title is perfect. I do tend to hate him a little bit, but it's a good move by Mattel. I think there is probably a big audience out there. And maybe they'll tweak that jingle a little bit, right?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they could tweak the jingle. They can make it-- but I mean, you know what? It works for them. It's very catchy. Once you hear it, it's hard to get out of your head. I actually couldn't think of it. And then right when you started singing it, it brought me back years and years and years ago. So I think it makes a lot of sense for Mattel. We'll see what the numbers look like. We'll see what their product line looks like. I'm excited. You're not. You don't have kids, though, that are as young as mine, so that's why.DAVE BRIGGS: I love you.]"

The show was often set on a playground or in a classroom and featured Barney’s cast of fuzzy friends including Baby Bop, a green Triceratops, and mostly child actors, including Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez.Even after the half-hour show was over for the day, Barney was still everywhere to be found in children’s homes, depicted in stuffed animals, home videos, books, T-shirts, pillow cases — a product line whose sales totaled tens of millions of dollars in its first year alone.Barney became a global phenomenon and landed the playful T. rex on the cover of People magazine’s most interesting people issue but eventually went off air in 2010.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

I have been looking forward to this conversation.Erin Lydon: I'm so delighted to be here with you. And thank you to Northern Trust for having me.SW: Absolutely! I think that what you're doing with Poker Power is so interesting. And I have to admit, at first I didn't get it - poker and women? And then the more I learned, it hit me. Our organizations both share the mission of the economic empowerment of women and recognize the importance of providing the resources and tools to really impact them and help them build confidence around money. And I just I love that! So, I'd like for you to start there. What is poker power? And really, I think, almost more importantly, why poker?EL: Great. Happy to do so. I get asked this question a lot. The company name is Poker Power. So, at our core, we are a community of girls and women, and we are using the game of poker, the strategy of poker, to empower women across the globe. And we do it through a very innovative curriculum. We are virtual; we are in person; we are on apps. We've built the products that are needed to deliver the messages and the skills and the strategies that are so critical for girls across the board - we say we're from interns all the way to the C-suite, teenagers to grandmas. That is our community.You may not know this if you're not a poker player, but poker is a game of adjustments. Poker is a game of imperfect information. And what occurs at a poker table so closely mirrors what occurs in a boardroom or what occurs at a negotiation table. When you're talking with a client and you're trying to figure out a strategy to get them to the next step - all of that can be practiced through poker game play, and that's the secret sauce. Typically, when you think of poker you think of gross smoky basements, opulent casinos and you think of places that women don't sit. And that's what we're changing.Story continuesSW: I love it! And you're talking about how it's teaching negotiation skills and how it's teaching strategy, right? To be more strategic, to think beyond just what's in front of you, to try to predict and react. I love that. And I think even beyond just negotiating during the day-to-day at work, even negotiating your worth. It's so important not just for us, but especially for the next generation. Can you talk a little bit about how this all came about? Because it really is an incredible story.EL: Well, I love telling this story because I was not a poker player at all. And I started my career on Wall Street. I started a career in finance in 1999 and back then pay was secret and pregnancy was hidden. And I was surrounded by a lot of men and a lot of poker, and I never took my seat.The original idea for Poker Power actually came from Jenny Just. She is the co-founder of PEAK6, which is an equity options trading firm here in Chicago, as well as many other businesses. In fact, we are one of the portfolio companies. The moment that really was the ‘aha' around poker was with her 14-year-old daughter, Juliet, who at the time was a very good tennis player but had had kind of a mediocre match. Jenny and her husband Matt were in their kitchen talking, and Matt says, ‘Juliette should learn to play poker.'Jenny, who is a visionary and sees a solution to a problem before most of us even realize there is a problem, sort of sat with that idea: ‘Should I really teach my 14-year-old daughter to play poker?' And it sounded so funny to her, especially because there are three older boys in that family. All three of them know how to play poker and they weren't taught. They just grew up knowing how to play poker.SW: That's right. My three boys as well.EL: But why did it sound so strange to say that a 14-year-old girl should learn to play? What Matt was getting at is he realized in her tennis game, she wasn't playing the player. She wasn't being strategic. She wasn't predicting and using probabilities, thinking what's going to happen next in the match. And so, he saw that as something that could be improved through the game of poker.And so, when we started we were very focused on high school girls. Initially, it made sense. We got Juliet and a bunch of her friends together. We had to find a female poker teacher, which is not easy to do. Our very first teacher is actually a Chicago Public Schools third-grade teacher and an excellent poker player. It really was grassroots.But what started to happen is the moms would say, ‘Well, if it's so good for my 14-year-old daughter, why am I not doing this?' Women typically don't play this game, and women certainly don't Google how to play poker. So, the whole premise around the game, and the negative stereotypes so many of us hold, prevents us from even exploring that this could be just an incredible tool.SW: Well, I think that's what hit me, personally. As I learned about it, I was like, ‘wait, wait, what?' I had the exact initial reaction that you just described. And then when I began to peel back the onion and really dive into it, I thought, ‘This makes complete sense and why am I not playing?' In fact, we should all be playing. So it's working, Erin!And I love the story of how it was created. Can you talk a little bit about the pivot? While you did start with girls, the company is now heading into a different direction and yet you're using this new direction to still impact that next generation.EL: So, I joined the company in February of 2020, and if you think back to February 2020, there was a lot happening in the world. And three weeks later, we were in lockdown. I thought I was going to run a company where we taught real women, with real chips and cards at real tables. That was the idea. But very quickly we had to pivot and become very innovative. We had to start to use the virtual world that we were all thrust into, or this business would have failed, and we would just run out of steam.Very quickly the girls who were in our community were completely overwhelmed by the amount of time they had to spend on Zoom. Their schooling and the disruption to their lives was enormous. We really lost the momentum that we had just started to build. We had three months to figure it out. That's the runway that Jenny gave us to create a virtual curriculum.We knew we had to make poker incredibly welcoming and inclusive. And that's not what the game is. It is none of those things. We also had to make it bite size, we had to make the lessons digestible. We had to translate gameplay to negotiation and decision making and problem solving, and we had to create the fun part. And I don't know if you remember, but it was hard to have fun across a Zoom screen. We didn't know how to do that.SW: No, none of us did.EL: And so as we looked to bring our community together, we started to pivot to corporates. And the reason we did that is it is so clearly a next step for women on any step of the ladder looking to accelerate their careers. They're looking to get comfortable with money. And you can do that through the game of poker. We initially partnered with a few internal companies at PEAK6.Our first actual external client was the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, the big technology conference for women, and we taught 100 C-suite technologists over Zoom. And I will tell you, I've never gone back and watched that video because I think I would just be absolutely mortified, you know how bumpy we were at being virtual back then.SW: Yes, we all were!EL: But that's really when we started to receive feedback like, ‘Oh, this is fun, this is fascinating. I see why these skills matter!'SW: And you're building a community, which is so critical at any time. But I think during that time in particular, creating that engagement, creating those connections for people was so important. Obviously, so many positives there. And your timing - there are a lot of silver linings that came from that period of time. We all learned a lot. And I'm glad that this new direction has yielded such success.I also think it is important to add that we all want to give something positive to our children, right? Of course, I want to teach my three boys things and give them tools that will positively impact their careers, their lives, and help them learn from our successes, right? As well as our mistakes. But we often don't sit back and realize how much we need something in that moment. And you've created awareness around that.And also, the need for modeling. If we do it first, we're showing the next generation through our actions, not words. So, you're really creating a phenomenal way to help ourselves and the current leaders of corporate America, but also to impact our children. And I just love that. I think engaging that next gen this way is powerful, and maybe even more powerful than the original direction of the company.EL: I do too. And I think poker game play at its core is a game of interaction. No one plays poker all by themself. It's not very much fun. You need a community. And what happened during the pandemic for us, pivoting mostly towards corporates - we will always teach young girls; it's very much part of our mission - but now we've been able to scale to 40 countries and we have 150 corporate partners. That, I really don't think - and I can say that as the person running this company - my head would have gone there back when we started. It simply wasn't a possibility.SW: I love it. So why don't we talk a little bit about the curriculum? Because how you're doing it is really impactful. First the why, but now let's get into your approach.EL: We've built 18 one-hour poker lessons. That's our flagship offering and that's what we deliver across the globe via virtual lessons. When you first learn with us, we will tell you that you're going to learn leadership lessons by gamifying poker. It's gamifying the game of poker. We've also gamified leadership.Each lesson has a theme and each one is an hour. The first one is courage, because it takes a lot of courage for a woman to sit down at a poker table. We're very trepidatious to do that. The next one is bold. This lesson teaches how to use aggression at the poker table, which is a critical skill to win a poker game. This is just as critical when you're negotiating and working with clients.SW: I love what you just said because so often as women, we shy away from being aggressive. We are afraid of delivering that message. If we're aggressive, how will that be received by others? What you are talking about really is about building confidence. Confidence in the game of poker transcends into confidence in life. I love it! I know you have some rules too, right?EL: Oh, we do, yes. We like to only give two or three bits of information in each one of our lessons, and that's what we want the women to be practicing when they're playing with us. For lesson one, our rule is no limping. And it is just as bad as it sounds. In poker, no limping means that you can't just put in enough chips to stay in the hand. In other words, you're not going to call the hand and put the minimum in.Instead, what we teach in our classes is that we want you to do three times the big blind. And if you don't play poker, I am sure you're thinking ‘what is all that?' There is so much jargon in poker so please don't worry about it. All you have to take away from this is you don't get to play the minimum, and I want you to push to the maximum. I want you to actually feel outside of your comfort zone and fail because you're going to lose a lot at poker. Even the best poker players lose a lot of hands at poker. The secret is, that when you have the hand or when you're in the position to bluff (and there's a lot of factors that will help you make that decision) that's when you're going to lean in and be aggressive.As women - and I know this about myself - if you didn't grow up doing that on the sport court or you never navigated a male dominated environment and been successful, it can feel really challenging. And we can't just walk into the first time we negotiate something that really matters and know how to do it. You have to practice it. And the poker table is a superb place to practice.SW: Unbelievable. First of all, ‘no limping' is the new mantra… I love it! It's so symbolic of so many things, but what you're also talking about is building the confidence to take risks, and leaning into that discomfort, because discomfort means you're growing. I love it. And this is a real live version of it all playing out and seeing the rewards and, to your point, the failures. Because we learn from those too. I love that you highlighted that. Brilliant.EL: One of the other lessons that is easy to remember so we say it a lot, is that if your hand is good enough to play, it's good enough to raise. Without knowing the jargon of poker, all you need to understand is that as you're looking at your two cards - and they're private, no one sees those - you have to make a very binary decision. Am I going to raise or am I going to fold? Fold means you're out of the game. Raise means you're still playing. In Poker Power, we say if your hand is good enough to raise - and we help you understand how to make that decision - then we want you to play it really big. We want you to go in with a lot of chips.And I can tell you whether it's virtual, or at an inperson workshop, as soon as we say to a player who puts in just two chips, we're like, ‘no, you've got to do three times the big blind,' which means six chips. Typically, she'll then say, ‘I can't do that. That's so much, that's so many chips. I can't do that.' And I say, ‘You can!' The physical act of pushing value to really validate the decision you've made - that shifts the mindset. It's intellectual and physical, and it works. The best moment is when a woman has analyzed the situation and she's made the right decision at the poker table, and she wins all those chips and gets to scoop them all back. That's my favorite part.SW: Those are powerful words, really powerful words, that you just said. It's much bigger than just at the poker table when you think about it in the game of life, right? One thing that is important to stress is no money is ever exchanged, correct?EL: Yes. Thank you for saying that. And it really is critical because the stereotypes around poker are very much situated within a casino or in a home game space where there's 20 bucks on the table. At Poker Power, there is no money. There's no gambling. Everything we're doing is to stack skills. And that's really how we think about it.And also, as you mentioned earlier, the risk taking - we actually were concerned in the very beginning that if there's no money on the table, is it really going to feel like a risk? Are you really going to be able to practice that? We now have no concerns about that at all because we have almost 30,000 women that are in our community now, and I've watched so many of them struggle to push those chips in.And what we know with women is if you have $10 to spend, you're going to really think ‘Do I spend it on me? Do I spend on my children? Do I spend on my charity?' Most often ‘me' doesn't get the $10. And so, we're typically very uncomfortable making that decision and then putting the risk into the table. We think it's just a critical way to get better at it.SW: Yes, I couldn't agree more. Well, let's talk a little bit about that next gen, because I know this whole amazing idea started with the desire to impact the next gen. You're very much impacting the next generation in the work you're doing right now through your corporate programs, through the mothers, the sisters, the aunts. But can you talk about the great work you're doing directly with the next gen? Again, aligning with the inspiration of how this all started?EL: Thank you for asking this because at our core we are so committed to empowering young girls. So actually, before they even step on to the ladder, they have leveled the playing field. We think it's really critical. And at Poker Power, we are not trying to exist outside of everything that happens in corporate America, outside of men at all. We're just trying to provide skills so that women can be more competitive when they get there.One of the things that we've done is partnered with a number of high schools, certainly here in the U.S., but even abroad. In fact, the partnership we're most proud of is with an organization called Global Give Back, which is an extraordinary nonprofit organization. And we have been asked to teach 5,000 girls across Kenya how to play poker. We completed our first cohort and are starting our second cohort in January 2023.It was an extraordinary experience, because obviously this is all virtual. You may not realize this, but technology was a big challenge. We needed cell phones for all the girls so they could play on the poker app. We had to deal with bandwidth issues on Zoom. There are many, many obstacles, but the girls stuck with it. Our instructors stuck with it.We've just received feedback from this first cohort. It's extraordinary how life changing it has been for these girls who grew up in very marginalized communities, with very limited opportunities. They sometimes play better than any of us. They are able to translate practicing aggression at the poker table and apply decision making at the poker table to the opportunities they're now creating for themselves.Anything we do with schools, we do without cost to the students. As I shared, it's very much a part of our mission and we want to be empowering the next generation. And now we have this incredible example of what we've done in Kenya, and we want to replicate it around the world.SW: It's not only where you started (focusing on next gen) but really where you've been doubling down - no pun intended.EL: Raising the stakes.SW: Exactly. I mean you're helping them, no doubt. But the gift back to you, as an organization, is huge. Just phenomenal work. What are some other examples?EL: Another thing to add is that many in our community now are adult women and working women. And what we love to see is when the women start to share this with their daughters and their nieces. And I can tell you personally that this happened to me over Thanksgiving. I have two teenage daughters. One is 16 and one is 19. And my 19-year-old came home from college and I said, ‘Will you play poker with me?' She knows how to play, but she's not really a game player. She's just not that comfortable. Well, she played phenomenally. The progress I saw in her, her processing and analyzing of information, she's thinking about the probabilities of pot odds and making decisions based on that. So, I had that moment with her. But even more importantly, I now have a game that I'm playing with both of my daughters, and they feel amazing. They feel so confident when they get to pull all the chips in from the pot.We know that this is very much from mother to daughter, to sister to friend - that is truly how we're going to scale to a million women, which is the goal. And so, if I can teach you and then you can pass it on to your niece, and she's going to tell someone else because you don't play poker alone. You have to find a community to play with. So come to us or certainly, you know, share it with your friends and family.SW: Well, I love that story because it's about meeting at a common place to do something together. And even the dialogue that comes out of that experience together is a gift. And I think there's so much talk about how generations are so disconnected, and how the next generation thinks differently than we do. We do think differently than them, but this is a way to bring generations together and do something and learn together, simultaneously. Now you have become quite a player, haven't you? But for me, sitting down with next gen, I'm at the starting point just like them. I've never done it before. So, to do that together, I think is really powerful and a really unique opportunity.EL: Well, the poker table is a meritocracy. And the reason we say that is, it doesn't matter where you went to school; it doesn't matter what your title is. When you sit down at the poker table in those first few hands everyone is even until you start to play the player, which is what we say in Poker Power: you're playing the player, not just the cards.For girls in particular, that can be such a confidence booster for them because it doesn't matter what the background is. We are going to start to play this game. I may know you as a colleague, but I don't know how you're going to play poker. And there's all sorts of personalities and skill sets that come out at a poker table.And in fact, at a poker table, you actually never have to speak. And that's another very interesting point for women who might be more reserved verbally with what they want to say in particularly high stakes, confrontational settings. You don't have to say a word at a poker table. You can make all your decisions, show all your worth, by how you play those cards and those chips.SW: I never thought about it like that, but really an interesting insight. And you're absolutely right!Well, Erin, I cannot thank you enough for your work. I think our audience will understand why I got so excited when I heard about Poker Power and learned more about the great work that you and your team are doing. I'm excited to start playing poker!EL: I can't wait to teach you!

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The Third Point Offshore Fund returned 1.2% net in the fourth quarter compared to a 7.5% return for the S&amp;P 500 INDEX (TR) and a 9.9% return for the MSCI WORLD INDEX (TR). Defensive portfolio orientation, weakness in several large positions, and write-offs/ markdowns in crypto-related private investments impacted the fund’s performance in the quarter relative to indexes.

On February 13, 2023, American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) stock closed at $61.96 per share. One-month return of American International Group, Inc.

(NYSE:AIG) has a market capitalization of $46.035 billion.Third Point made the following comment about American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Third Point initiated a position in American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) during the Fourth Quarter. AIG is a global P&amp;C insurer that, until recently, held a life insurance subsidiary, Corebridge. AIG has undergone a massive overhaul since the global financial crisis. The current executive team, who started in 2017, has made significant progress turning around the P&amp;C insurance operations that previously suffered from unprofitable underwriting, significant loss volatility, and inadequate reserving. Over the past five years, AIG has professionalized the underwriting team, meaningfully reduced gross limits, restructured its reinsurance programs, and pruned the portfolio for profitable growth. As a result, AIG’s P&amp;C operations have gone from an unprofitable 117% combined ratio in 2017 to a 92% combined ratio in 2022 and have seen seven consecutive quarters of favorable reserve development.Alongside the operational turnaround, c is repositioning itself as a pure-play P&amp;C insurer via the IPO of Corebridge which was completed in September 2022. This is an important catalyst for the business. First, we expect that $11 billion of proceeds from the sell-down of AIG’s remaining Corebridge stake will be primarily redeployed towards share repurchases, resulting in an ability to buy back a quarter of the company over the next two years. Second, there is an opportunity to streamline the corporate expense base with the simplification of AIG’s business as AIG no longer operates within the conglomerate structure that historically governed its operations.Today, AIG trades at 1.1x book value (excluding Corebridge) compared to pure-play global P&amp;C insurance peers which trade at a 50% multiple premium. AIG’s strong fundamental operating results coupled with the catalysts following the separation of Corebridge position should help AIG close that substantial valuation discount.""Story continuesAmerican International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG), Sign, American general, building, logoAndrew Scheck / Shutterstock.comAmerican International Group, Inc.

AIG is set to continue its earnings beat streak in the fourth quarter of 2022, the results of which are expected to be released on Feb 15, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading global insurance organization’s adjusted operating earnings of 66 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9% due to solid performance in General Insurance despite the negative impacts of Hurricane Ian, and increased Life and Retirement premiums. However, the positives were partially offset by reduced alternative investment income and higher expenses.Now, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.19 has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 30 days against no movement in the opposite direction. The estimated figure, however, suggests a decrease of 24.7% from the prior-year reported number. American International beat the consensus estimate in three of the prior four quarters and missed once, the average being 13%. This is depicted in the graph below.American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $11,840 million indicates a 13.5% decrease from the year-ago reported figure, whereas our estimate suggests a 14.8% decline.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for American International this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +0.70%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $1.20 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Story continuesZacks Rank: American International currently has a Zacks Rank #2.Factors to NoteImproved retention, new business and continued growth in the insurance premium rate are likely to have increased net premiums earned in General Insurance for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums written in General Insurance is pegged at $6,365 million, indicating a 6.8% increase from the year-ago period's reported figure, which is expected to have positioned the company for a beat this time around.However, profits from General Insurance are likely to have decreased due to increased losses and loss adjustment expenses, as well as a lower net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted pre-tax income of $882 million for the fourth quarter indicates a decline of 41.6% from the year-ago period, positioning the company for a year-over-year bottom-line fall.The consensus mark for adjusted pre-tax income in Group Retirement, a part of Life and Retirement, is pegged at $223 million, signaling a 29% year-over-year decline, whereas our estimate indicates a 24.3% year-over-year fall.The consensus mark for adjusted pre-tax income for the overall Life and Retirement business is pegged at $834 million, signaling a decrease of 13.9% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure.Its transformative program, named AIG 200, is expected to have enabled the company to further curb costs and expenses in the fourth quarter. This is likely to have provided the bottom line some breathing room in the quarter under review.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:AssetMark Financial Holdings, Inc.

Results of Insurance, one of the Finance sector industries, are likely to have benefited from better pricing and exposure growth, accelerated digitalization and improving interest rate.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified three insurers namely, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Manulife Financial Corporation MFC and Primerica, Inc. PRI, which are poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Impact Q4 ResultsThe fourth quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of winter storm Elliot.  Karen Clark &amp; Company estimates industry losses from Elliot to be about $5.4 billion. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The fourth quarter itself saw two rate hikes. A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, coupled with an improving rate environment, are expected to have aided net investment income, an important component of insurers’ top line.Life insurers have been redesigning products focusing on protection products. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. Increasing awareness and demand for protection products are likely to have driven sales.The insurance industry continues to invest in digitalization. Accelerated digitalization is likely to have saved costs and driven margin expansion.Banking on operational efficiency resulting in a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions, build on a niche, expand globally, diversify their portfolio and deploy capital to make dividend hikes and pay special dividends. Thus, share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.Story continuesPotential Q4 OutperformersAmerican International provides insurance products for commercial, institutional, and individual customers in North America and internationally.  Well-performing Commercial and Personal lines businesses are likely to drive the quarterly results. The hardening of insurance rates and new business growth bodes well for premium growth. The multi-year initiative to achieve transformational changes is likely to have aided cost savings. The company is expected to achieve run-rate savings of $1 billion by the end of 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.19, suggesting a decrease of 24.7% from the year-ago reported figure.

Regardless of what the Fed’s actual terminal rate is, we see the Fed staying on hold for a prolonged period as it assesses the impact of its policy.""The potential for lower interest rates at some point later this year has fueled a strong rebound in tech stocks out of the gate in 2023.Year to date, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) has advanced an eye-popping 13.7%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500's (^GSPC) 7.7% gain.And household name tech stocks have enjoyed even heartier gains: Meta (META) has skyrocketed 49% in 2023, Netflix (NFLX) is up 20%, and Apple (AAPL) has increased 18%.The strong increases in tech companies' market caps have come despite mixed fourth-quarter earnings and outlooks this month, not to mention a steady drumbeat of layoff news by the likes of PayPal (PYPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).Chaudhuri was particularly concerned about the pace of corporate earnings and how they don't appear to square with the rise in tech valuations.That concern isn't misplaced: Fourth-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 tech companies dropped 10.4% year over year, according to Bank of America, and sales for tech have been tracking down 1.7% from a year ago.On top of that, 2023 earnings estimates for tech have fallen by 17% from June 2022 through early February, the BofA data showed.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell looks at his phone during a meeting at the International Monetary Fund World Bank Group Annual Meetings in Washington, DC, on October 14, 2022. (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)Moreover, various Fed members have been out in the force over the past week tamping down on the possibility of a pivot on rate policy.Overall, pros such as Chaudhuri believe the conditions are in place for a pullback in high-growth areas of the market like tech.Story continues""The rally has been fueled in no small part by the decline in rates, with the correlation between S&amp;P 500 total returns and 10-year Treasury yields at its most negative in 20 years,"" Chaudhuri wrote.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for TJX Companies, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$4.6b ÷ (US$28b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 27%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for TJX Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for TJX Companies.So How Is TJX Companies' ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at TJX Companies doesn't inspire confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 46%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, TJX Companies is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 126% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with TJX Companies (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Gatos Silver, Inc. engages in the exploration and production of precious metals. With the latest financial year loss of US$35m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of US$12m, the US$323m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Gatos Silver will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for the company. View our latest analysis for Gatos Silver Consensus from 2 of the American Metals and Mining analysts is that Gatos Silver is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2022, before turning a profit of US$9.8m in 2023. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around 12 months from now or less. We calculated the rate at which the company must grow to meet the consensus forecasts predicting breakeven within 12 months. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 14% is expected, which seems realistic. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Gatos Silver given that this is a high-level summary, though, keep in mind that generally metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a double-digit growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. The company has managed its capital judiciously, with debt making up 3.2% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are key fundamentals of Gatos Silver which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Forza Petroleum (TSE:FORZ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Forza Petroleum, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$97m ÷ (US$658m - US$89m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Forza Petroleum has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Oil and Gas industry average of 21%.

If you're interested in investigating Forza Petroleum's past further, check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Does the ROCE Trend For Forza Petroleum Tell Us?It's great to see that Forza Petroleum has started to generate some pre-tax earnings from prior investments. Historically the company was generating losses but as we can see from the latest figures referenced above, they're now earning 17% on their capital employed. Additionally, the business is utilizing 22% less capital than it was five years ago, and taken at face value, that can mean the company needs less funds at work to get a return. This could potentially mean that the company is selling some of its assets.Story continuesOur Take On Forza Petroleum's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Forza Petroleum has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 10.0% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Forza Petroleum, we've discovered 5 warning signs that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

""We grew revenue 8% operationally, driven by our innovative companion animal franchises across parasiticides, dermatology and pain. We also grew our adjusted net income faster than sales for the year, at 11% operationally, while continuing to support investments in R&amp;D, manufacturing capacity, and sales and marketing efforts that will drive future growth.""""Looking ahead, we are well-positioned with the strategy and capabilities to expand in large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics, while still investing in comprehensive solutions across the continuum of animal care. We are committed to continuing our track record of value creation and above-market performance even in the face of today’s economic uncertainty, and we are guiding to full-year operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue in 2023,"" said Peck.QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTSZoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two regional segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for companion animals and livestock tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the fourth quarter of 2022:Revenue in the U.S. segment was $1.112 billion, an increase of 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Sales of companion animal products increased 12%, driven by growth in the company’s parasiticide portfolio, primarily Simparica Trio® for dogs. The company’s key dermatology portfolio also contributed to growth across both the Apoquel® and Cytopoint® brands. Sales of livestock products declined 6% in the quarter. Sales of cattle products declined as a result of supply re-stocking in the third quarter of 2022 and generic competition for Draxxin®. The company’s poultry portfolio declined due to the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix®, the company’s alternative to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. Sales of swine products also decreased modestly in the quarter.Revenue in the International segment was $901 million, essentially flat on a reported basis and an increase of 12% operationally compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Sales of companion animal products grew 7% on a reported basis and 21% operationally. Contributing to growth in the quarter was the company’s parasiticide portfolio, primarily Revolution® and Simparica®, as well as key dermatology products including the recently launched chewable version of Apoquel. Also contributing to growth in the quarter were the company’s monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain, Librela® for dogs and Solensia® for cats. Sales of livestock products declined 7% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally. Growth in the company’s fish portfolio was the result of increased sales of vaccines across key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of the company’s poultry portfolio grew due to market expansion and demand generation efforts in several key geographies, while sales of sheep products grew due to the acquisition of Jurox in Australia. Growth in fish, poultry and sheep was partially offset by reduced sales in the company’s swine and cattle portfolios due primarily to supply constraints.INVESTMENTS IN GROWTHZoetis continues to grow key product franchises through new product approvals and incremental claim extensions. On the companion animal side of the business, Simparica Trio (sarolaner/moxidectin/pyrantel) received approval in the European Union (EU) and the U.K. for additional claims related to faster kill time of ticks. In livestock, Fostera® Gold PCV MH, a one-shot vaccine for pigs that offers the longest lasting combined protection against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections, was approved for use in pregnant gilts and sows in the U.S., EU and Canada, expanding its original claims.In Canada, the company’s fifth largest market by revenue in 2022, Zoetis gained approvals for two key livestock products: Protivity®, the first modified live vaccine to offer protection against Mycoplasma bovis, providing cattle producers and veterinarians with broader overall protection against bovine respiratory disease (BRD), as well as Poulvac® Procerta® HVT-IBD-ND, a part of the company’s recombinant vector vaccine portfolio for poultry, which provides early, robust protection against Marek’s, infectious bursal and Newcastle disease viruses with one dose.In Diagnostics, Zoetis expanded its multi-purpose Vetscan Imagyst™ platform in the U.S. to include new applications for artificial intelligence (AI) dermatology and AI equine Fecal Egg Count (FEC) analysis. These additions broaden the platform’s testing capabilities for veterinarians, redefining what is possible for veterinary diagnosis and animal care across species.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEZoetis is providing full year 2023 guidance, which includes:Revenue between $8.575 billion to $8.725 billion (operational growth of 6% to 8%)Reported net income between $2.345 billion to $2.400 billionAdjusted net income between $2.490 billion to $2.540 billion (operational growth of 7% to 9%)Reported diluted EPS between $5.03 to $5.14Adjusted diluted EPS between $5.34 to $5.44This guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January.

Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.See Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information for notes (1) and (2).ZOETIS INC.RECONCILIATION OF GAAP REPORTED TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED INFORMATIONCERTAIN LINE ITEMS(UNAUDITED)(millions of dollars, except per share data)Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022GAAPReported(a)PurchaseAccountingAdjustmentsAcquisition-RelatedCosts(1)CertainSignificantItems(2)Non-GAAPAdjusted(b)Cost of sales$2,454$(6)$—$(8)$2,440Gross profit5,6266—85,640Selling, general and administrative expenses2,009(29)——1,980Research and development expenses539(1)——538Amortization of intangible assets150(124)——26Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs11—(5)(6)—Other (income)/deductions–net40——(42)(2)Income before provision for taxes on income2,6561605562,877Provision for taxes on income545401(3)583Net income attributable to Zoetis2,1141204592,297Earnings per common share attributable to Zoetis–diluted4.490.260.010.124.88Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021]"

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Collegium Pharmaceutical and Zoetis are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that COLL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ZTS has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.COLL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.31, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 29.73. We also note that COLL has a PEG ratio of 0.22. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.69.Another notable valuation metric for COLL is its P/B ratio of 4.63. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 15.83.Based on these metrics and many more, COLL holds a Value grade of A, while ZTS has a Value grade of C.Story continuesCOLL has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ZTS, so it seems like value investors will conclude that COLL is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates. Dividend-growing companies have histories of consistently increasing their dividend payments, which is particularly beneficial for income investors. Historical returns of dividend stocks have also shown that they have lower price volatility compared to non-dividend stocks.Continuous changes in monetary policies in 2022 altered investor sentiment and brought dividend securities into the limelight. Though S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% last year, dividend companies remained on strong footing, rewarding investors with stable returns. According to a report by ProShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fell by just 6.21% in 2022 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index reported a 0.11% drop, versus a harsher decline of the wider market. Similarly, Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index. These numbers show that dividend growth strategies outperformed the broader market in large-, small-, and mid-cap spaces in the US. Some companies that have consistently raised their dividends include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX).Another report by Allspring Global Investments also highlighted the positive performance of dividend stocks over time. The report mentioned that dividend growers delivered the best risk/return relation in 30 years ending December 2020.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:We first listed down stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats group, the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. From these stocks, we shortlisted companies with dividend growth rates of at least 8% in the past 12 months. These growth rates go up to 31%, as you will see in the article. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend growth rates.Story continuesDividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates15. Caterpillar Inc.

Here is what the firm had to say:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”14. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)12-Month Dividend Growth Rate: 8.5%Another best dividend growth stock on our list is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), which is an American medical device and healthcare company.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”13.

Gatos Silver, Inc. engages in the exploration and production of precious metals. With the latest financial year loss of US$35m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of US$12m, the US$323m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Gatos Silver will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for the company. View our latest analysis for Gatos Silver Consensus from 2 of the American Metals and Mining analysts is that Gatos Silver is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2022, before turning a profit of US$9.8m in 2023. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around 12 months from now or less. We calculated the rate at which the company must grow to meet the consensus forecasts predicting breakeven within 12 months. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 14% is expected, which seems realistic. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Gatos Silver given that this is a high-level summary, though, keep in mind that generally metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a double-digit growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. The company has managed its capital judiciously, with debt making up 3.2% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are key fundamentals of Gatos Silver which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

Mazrouei said he’s “not expecting a shock” as a result of US plans announced on Monday to release more crude from its strategic reserves.Delegates from the OPEC+ alliance have said the group intends to adhere to current output targets for the rest of the year, even after fellow member Russia announced a hefty 500,000 barrel-a-day output cutback last week in retaliation for European Union sanctions.Story continuesOil has had a mixed start to 2023 as traders attempt to price the demand impact of China’s re-opening, supply curbs announced by Moscow amid the war in Ukraine, and persistent concerns that tighter US monetary policy may trigger a recession.The UAE isn’t concerned about its current production quota agreed with OPEC+, though it will consider whether to seek a higher level when the group comes to discuss output for 2024, Mazrouei said.RBC Capital Markets LLC said last month that Abu Dhabi might seek a higher target this year in order to utilize new capacity it has developed over the past few years.(Updates throughout with comment from the minister.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Ben &amp; Jerry’s Ended Up at War With ItselfUK Getting It ‘Totally Wrong’ on Soaring Child Care CostsThe Pandemic Sent US Consumers Back to the Sugar BowlSocial Media Case Tests Limits of Supreme Court’s Tech SavvyChatGPT Becomes a New Target for Right-Wing Commentators©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Check out shares, up nearly 7% on the day. Another travel stock, Tripadvisor, also preparing to release earnings tomorrow afternoon.Jed Kelly, Oppenheimer's Managing Director of Equity Research covers both. Good to see you, sir. Let's start with Airbnb. Why the pop? And what are your expectations?JED KELLY: Yeah, I think the pop today is related to some strong third-party data we're seeing from AirDNA. They do a decent job tracking Airbnb activity. And they really-- I think they released their January data over the weekend, and it looks pretty strong.So I think investors that subscribe to that data, it's pointing to January nights actually accelerating. So it looks like there could actually potentially be upside to the Street's earnings. I mean, Airbnb is a very highly shorted stock too, so there's probably short covering going-- going into the print. So I think those are the two leading factors for why the stock's up today.SEANA SMITH: Jed, you also cover Tripadvisor, have a market perform rating on that stock. It's also had a strong start to the year, up about 35%. What would make you more optimistic, more bullish on this name heading into not only the report tomorrow, but the second half of the year?JED KELLY: Yeah, with Tripadvisor, it's all around the strategy. Their attract-- their tours and activities business Viator continues to be on a pretty solid growth trajectory. The key is what's the new CEO Matt Goldberg going to do around Tripadvisor core, and how do you make that asset more monetizable, right?Story continuesThey have a lot of Google competition. I know everyone's talking about some of the new search features you're seeing around AI and how that impacts travel. If Google and Bing are able to do-- enhance their search around travel with AI, then that's a headwind for Tripadvisor.So I think with Tripadvisor, a lot of it's around what's the strategy. I mean, we've been covering this stock now, I think, for almost seven years. We've never been able to recommend it. And it's all about the Google risk. So the more you use Google Maps, the more negative it is for Tripadvisor.DAVID BRIGGS: Boy, interesting point on the AI, touches just about every industry we cover here. Earlier today, Expedia CEO Peter Kern joined us and had this to say about travel demand so far in '23. Listen.PETER KERN: So far through the beginning of the year, it's been pretty strong throughout. It's not just a January thing. And it's global. We've seen it in many places. We've seen it driven by lots of categories.International continues to grow. And remember, we're seeing a time where last year this time, a lot of things weren't open yet. So things like cherry blossoms, international events, things like that are still growing, and people are getting back to that in a pretty robust way.DAVID BRIGGS: Got to love the cherry blossoms. The initial read on this, Jed, was it was revenge travel. But is your data telling you this is just kind of a new norm, the commitment to travel?JED KELLY: Yeah, I don't know if it's necessarily new norm. You know, I think we've been seeing it, right, even before COVID experiences were going-- growing faster than things, especially with the younger generation, Gen Z, millennials. They like-- they value experiences over things. So I think there's part of that.I think the other thing that COVID has let people do is it's given people more flexibility to not have to travel on a Friday and come back on a Sunday, right? You can now leave on a Wednesday or Thursday, two cheaper days to fly, and come back maybe on a Monday or Tuesday. So I think that flexibility's a pop to demand.And you know, I wouldn't call it revenge travel. I mean, the data is pretty strong in the US. The US has been pretty open for travel now for at least the last 18 months. And we're coming up on spring break travel here in the Northeast. It's-- rates are still high. You're trying to fly, and it's still really high. So I think it's-- I think it's just people wanting to travel. And I think it's this thing that experiences are valued over products or things.SEANA SMITH: Jed, so you travel-- you cover travel. You also cover DraftKings. It's certainly coming off a huge weekend, you would think, for the company. They had their Super Bowl ad.Certainly, you would think they saw a huge uptick in terms of traffic on their site. How big of a boost do you see Super Bowl being to DraftKings? And what are you expecting to hear from the company later this week?JED KELLY: Yeah, I think Super Bowl, it's in their guidance. I think you look at the GeoComply data, I think traffic to sites was up over 30%, so that's strong. We're hearing that I think the Super Bowl was a net positive for the books. The Chiefs winning was a good outcome. The game did go over, but I think they all had pretty good-- pretty good outcomes in their prop bets, even though you did have stars with big games.So I think-- I don't know. I think the Super Bowl is in the guidance. I think the outlook's all about, are they able to go and be able to prove to the Street that they can actually generate and grow this business profitably, right? So they've got a pretty good outlook for state launches this year, so that should allow them to leverage their advertising spend better.And I think if you can start to show that they're leveraging their advertising spend, you also have the land-based guys being more rational, which is a positive. So I think you see more rationalization in the model-- or in the industry. And then you actually start to see advertising leverage and that it could be down year-over-year. I think that's a positive for the stock.SEANA SMITH: All right, we will see what we get later this week. DraftKings up about 3%-- or 8% over the last three months. Jed Kelly, thanks so much.]"

Expedia did note that demand bounced back in January. Very important there.Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern joins us now. Peter, always nice to get some time with you. Let's lock in on January. What did you see trendwise? And then have you anything could share on how February has been shaking out?PETER KERN: Yeah, I think, Brian-- [CLEARS THROAT] excuse me-- we've seen really nice rebound. You know, we were seeing accelerating demand through the fourth quarter. It's just that it got hit in-- particularly hard in the last few weeks as the storms came through. And we're very weighted towards North America and that was a big hit for us.But demand was growing through the fourth quarter. And we saw kind of a step change into January. And so far through the beginning of the year, it's been pretty strong throughout. It's not just a January thing. And, you know, it's global. We've seen it in many places. We've seen it driven by lots of categories. International continues to grow.And remember, we're seeing a time where last year this time, we-- a lot of things weren't open yet. So things like Cherry Blossoms International Events, things like that are still growing, and people are getting back to that in a pretty robust way.BRIAN SOZZI: And where is China playing into this comeback?PETER KERN: Yeah, I mean, China's really not gonna be, I don't think, in anybody's numbers in a strong way-- meaningful way until probably the latter half of the year. There's tons of demand. We're seeing lots of searches. We're seeing lots of searches in and out of China. We have B2B partners in China that are very important to us.Story continuesBut because of the flight lanes and how much airlift there is, it's still somewhat limited. There's a lot of rules, as you've probably heard about, in terms of getting in and out and testing for Chinese residents going into other countries.So there's a lot of demand, clearly. There's a lot of interest. But I think until the planes start going and we start really seeing that demand, a lot of the demand is a little ways out. So it'll come through the numbers, I think, more in the back half of the year. But it's definitely growing. And Asia, overall, is growing as more and more opens up. And it's outgrowing kind of the rest of the world right now.JULIE HYMAN: Hey, Peter. It's Julie here. What's sort of the biggest change that you've seen in the past six months, whether it's where people are going, the length of time they are staying, et cetera? What kind of stands out to you?PETER KERN: Yeah, I think we're seeing some of the things we've talked about before, which is kind of normalization, which is to say, you know, this time last year, it was Omicron. And so everybody loved Vrbos and other vacation rental properties at other of our competitors. Now, we're seeing a much more normalized mix towards resorts, hotels.Big cities are back in a big way. All the biggest-- you know, what used to be true, which is big cities sort of commanded the most search, is true again. So I think you're seeing kind of normalization, back to big cities. Normalization, back to international travel.And, you know, there's a little less-- we're seeing a little less of these long stays where people were never going back to the office and going to stay forever at vacation rentals. I think we're seeing a little normalization of that, too. Still lots and lots of travel but just a little bit more normal mix.JULIE HYMAN: And I know you guys have been working on customer and user loyalty, right? Have you found that customers are pretty fickle, they'll jump around looking for the best deal? What are they prioritizing right now?PETER KERN: Yeah, I think, you know, there's always gonna be a class of traveler who maybe wants to save the last dollar, and doesn't care who they book with, and doesn't care what the service is.But we believe that travel is really precious time and that people generally care deeply about doing it right. And so we've been highly invested in improving the shopping experience, in terms of knowing what you're getting, ranking all our suppliers in terms of the quality of their experience, giving customers more tools to shop and better understand what they're getting, because we believe, you know, most of us want to make sure we have the right trip, not just save the last dollar.And that goes all the way through to the shopping, you know, the in-trip experience, and the service side. And we found that our-- you know, our most loyal cohorts or the people we get into our loyalty program, people we get onto the app. And those have been our fastest growing cohorts during this last couple of years. So we're really excited about that. And we think the numbers, you know, are proving that out. So you know, people do want to go trust their trip with somebody they trust, not just take a trip, in our opinion.BRIAN SOZZI: Peter, we've talked in the past about the turnaround that you continue to drive at Expedia. What inning are you in that turnaround? And what are some of your most and just important goals for this year?PETER KERN: So I would say we're in the, you know, sixth inning coming up, maybe on the seventh inning stretch. Our big pushes this year are twofold. One, we have-- we're kind of finishing our big technical transformation. I mean, we're always improving our technology and adding features and capabilities. But we've been moving-- we moved hotels.com onto the same front end as Expedia.We're moving Vrbo in the coming months. And then we're launching our big all up loyalty program called One Key that's going to span all our biggest brands and be the most flexible, biggest rewards program in the industry. So that's a really big push for us that comes later this year.Once those two things are behind us, then it's sort of like the day-to-day just improving, and improving, and improving, and consolidating the back end. There's some efficiency opportunities there. So we're through a lot of it. And I said on our earnings, you know, we're now at a point where we have more tailwinds from the things we've done than headwinds, but we still have a couple of big things to do. But we believe we can drive really nice growth while doing those, as we have done in the past.JULIE HYMAN: Well, Peter, thanks for joining us this morning to chat about all of this. Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern, happy travels to you.PETER KERN: Nice to see you. Same to you.JULIE HYMAN: Thanks.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: MercadoLibre Inc. MELI, Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, United Rentals Inc. URI, Chewy Inc. CHWY and Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy Stocks Flying High Year to Date with More UpsideU.S. stock markets are rallying this year despite occasional fluctuations. Although it is too early to take a decision, market participants have regained confidence in risky assets like equities to some extent after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have rallied 1.7%, 6.3% and 12.6%, respectively.This trend is expected to continue as the rate of inflation and consequently the magnitude of the Fed's interest rate hike has declined. Buoyed by the early 2023 rally, several stocks have popped. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong upside left.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.""Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell's recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Story continuesPeak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.U.S. Economy Is CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter's growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy will expand by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities are the primary reasons for job cuts. Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the U.S. labor market remains resilient. Nonfarm payrolls in January came in at 517,000 well above the consensus estimate of 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, below the consensus mark of 3.6%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have rallied more than 20% year to date. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.MercadoLibre Inc. is benefiting from strength in the commerce and fintech businesses. Robust product offerings and credit portfolio expansion are respectively driving MELI's commerce and fintech revenues.Further, a robust mobile-point-of-sale business and the growing adoption of MELI are driving the total payment volume growth of the company. Also, the rapid adoption of Mobile Wallet remains a positive.MercadoLibre has expected revenue and earnings growth rates of 21.3% and 82.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.8% over the last seven days. The stock price of MELI has jumped 36.1% year to date.Expedia Group Inc. is benefiting from improvement across all its lines of business, owing to the increasing travel resiliency of people.

MCHP is gaining from recovery in demand across industrial, automotive and consumer end-markets, on reopening of economies, globally. Collaboration with the likes of AWS is another positive.Microchip Technology has expected revenue and earnings growth rates of 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, for next year (ending March 2024).

144,21e4fd16-1bc6-38f9-98a9-57b86816ed13,LMT,2023-02-14,"Boasting A 62% Return On Equity, Is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-62-return-equity-lockheed-140020028.html,1676296820,STORY,['LMT'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lockheed Martin is:62% = US$5.7b ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.62 in profit.Does Lockheed Martin Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Lockheed Martin has a better ROE than the average (10%) in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesLockheed Martin's Debt And Its 62% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Lockheed Martin, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.67. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Should the 3rd Circuit deny that request, Kaplan could dismiss the case within days.""It is my intent, when the mandate is issued, to issue an order dismissing the case,"" Kaplan said during Tuesday's hearing.Should the 3rd Circuit refuse a rehearing, LTL could seek to further delay the bankruptcy's dismissal, including potentially at the U.S. Supreme Court, a lawyer for the J&amp;J subsidiary, Greg Gordon, told the hearing.Absent a reversal, the 3rd Circuit's decision would force J&amp;J back into trial courts to battle nearly 40,000 lawsuits alleging the company's Baby Powder and other cosmetic products containing talc cause cancer. Gordon told the judge that LTL was engaged in a ""Herculean effort to get the defense team back in place"" to manage cases in trial courts should Kaplan ultimately dismiss the bankruptcy.J&amp;J maintains its talc products are safe.LTL's bankruptcy had put the deluge of talc cases on hold. Kaplan on Tuesday granted a 24-year-old plaintiff's request to allow his case to proceed in California in the wake of the 3rd Circuit's decision.Story continues""The pendulum has swung,"" Kaplan said, ruling that a trial for the terminally ill plaintiff should no longer be indefinitely halted on grounds that it could threaten LTL's bankruptcy reorganization.Kaplan said other cases would remain paused in the short term while LTL's appeals process unfolds.The 3rd Circuit decision more broadly cast a cloud over J&amp;J's use of a maneuver known as the Texas two-step, named for a Texas law the company employed to carve its consumer business into two new subsidiaries.In October 2021, J&amp;J offloaded the tidal wave of talc lawsuits it faced onto one of its newly created units, LTL, which then declared bankruptcy. Reuters last year detailed the secret planning of Texas two-steps by Johnson &amp; Johnson and other major firms in a series of reports exploring corporate attempts to evade lawsuits through bankruptcies.J&amp;J, with a market capitalization of more than $400 billion, has argued that the avalanche of lawsuits posed a serious financial threat. The company's costs of verdicts, settlements and legal fees soared to about $4.5 billion, with no end in sight, according to bankruptcy-court filings.The 3rd Circuit's reasoning underscored what some legal experts call an inherent contradiction: bankruptcies being executed by multinational firms worth billions of dollars that were in little danger of running out of money to pay plaintiff-creditors.LTL declared bankruptcy while J&amp;J avoided seeking Chapter 11 protection, with all its inherent financial and reputational wreckage.J&amp;J said it generously financed LTL to ensure a fair settlement - better, the company and its subsidiary argued, than trial courts where some plaintiffs receive outsized payments while others receive little or nothing.The 3rd Circuit found that J&amp;J's funding of the subsidiary, initially $2 billion and perhaps eventually more, undercut any claim of financial peril necessary to justify LTL's bankruptcy filing. In a petition seeking a rehearing filed Monday, a lawyer for LTL, Neal Katyal, called that reasoning ""upside-down.""A 2018 Reuters investigation found that J&amp;J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, was present in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company said in May 2020 it would stop selling talc-based Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, in part due to what it called ""misinformation"" and ""unfounded allegations"" about the product. The company later decided to stop selling talc-based Baby Powder globally starting this year. J&amp;J has denied its talc contains asbestos.(Reporting by Mike Spector in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

The cases, numbering more than 38,000, had been on hold since October 2021, when a J&amp;J subsidiary newly created to hold the talc liabilities filed for bankruptcy.Plaintiffs have said that J&amp;J's Baby Powder and other talc products contain asbestos and caused cancer.J&amp;J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free. The company has said it will challenge the ruling by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing the bankruptcy, which it said was intended in good faith to resolve talc claims efficiently and equitably.Shipp, 57, was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012. He has presided over a separate lawsuit against J&amp;J, in which an emeritus Harvard Law School professor is seeking to force the company to put his proposal requiring shareholders to bring any securities claims through private arbitration up for a shareholder vote. Shipp dismissed the most recent version of the lawsuit, which is now on appeal.He has overseen several pharmaceutical industry cases including patent disputes and a class action accusing Merck &amp; Co Inc of discriminating against pregnant employees, which settled in 2018.Before the 2021 bankruptcy filing, J&amp;J had faced costs of $3.5 billion in verdicts and settlements stemming from the talc litigation.A 2018 Reuters investigation found that J&amp;J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, was present in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products.

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 9.7%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.50, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.8% over that duration. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. It's encouraging to see that Mosaic has been growing its earnings per share at 63% a year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Mosaic Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 11.35%.Coming into today, shares of the pipeline operator had lost 3.02% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector gained 3.79%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.49%.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 20, 2023. On that day, Williams Companies, Inc. (The) is projected to report earnings of $0.47 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 20.51%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.08 billion, down 5.59% from the prior-year quarter.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Williams Companies, Inc. (The) should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

(The) (WMB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-inc-wmb-reports-150003023.html,1676300403,STORY,['WMB'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pipeline operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.08 billion, down 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.94% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Williams Companies, Inc. (The)?For Williams Companies, Inc. (The), the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Williams Companies, Inc. (The) will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Williams Companies, Inc. (The) would post earnings of $0.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of +9.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has been selected to power 210 Airbus narrowbody jets ahead of rival Pratt &amp; Whitney, while bigger jets will be powered by GE or Britain's Rolls-Royce .British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal would create new jobs.""Besides this deal being of unprecedented size, it was also incredibly complex,"" Wilson said in a note to employees.Air India, with its maharajah mascot, was once known for its lavishly decorated planes and stellar service but its reputation declined in the mid-2000s as financial troubles mounted.The record order aims to put Air India in the league of large global airlines and make it an influential customer for planemakers and suppliers at a time when its home market is seeing a strong post-COVID-19 travel surge.It reflects a strategy to recapture a solid share of trips between India's diaspora and cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai that are currently dominated by foreign rivals such as Emirates.It will also put Air India on a stronger footing to compete with domestic rival IndiGo, which has a majority share of the Indian market and a strong position in regional flights.(Reporting by Aditi Shah in Bengaluru and Tim Hepher in Paris; Additional reporting by Shilpa Jamkhandikar, David Shepardson; Editing by Jamie Freed, Mark Potter and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

That means adding 30 jobs ""while everybody else is trying to recruit people."" But he also worries about hiring too soon, risking workers sitting around if supply-chain problems persist.Since the pandemic, the aerospace supply chain has been hobbled by shortages in castings and forgings — particularly for aircraft engines — as well as a recent scarcity in extrusions, or other molded parts that can have lead times of up to 80 weeks, said Kevin Michaels, managing director of consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory.Story continues“Labor is the root cause of all three (parts shortages), and these bottlenecks in turn are leading, not surprisingly, to reduced inventory,” Michaels said.Aircraft manufacturers have expressed concerns about poaching employees from its suppliers. Airbus human resource chief Thierry Baril said in December the company is monitoring recruitment to ensure its supply chain is not weakened. The company plans to hire 13,000 workers in 2023, with more than 9,000 jobs to be located in Europe.Despite efforts to retain employees, overall turnover in the aerospace industry still grew from 5.8% to 7.1% in 2022, as inflation prompted workers to seek higher-paid jobs, according to a study by the Aerospace Industries Association.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna, editing by Ben Klayman and Nick Zieminski)]"

167,61927bed-da0a-416b-a054-4ee3e74c85d7,CI,2023-02-14,Why you should care about CVS acquiring Oak Street Health,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-you-should-care-about-cvs-acquiring-oak-street-health-221052049.html,1676326252,STORY,"['OSH', 'CVS', 'WBA', 'AMZN', 'CI', 'UNH']","[CVS's (CVS) announcement of its $10.6 billion deal for Oak Street Health (OSH) is just the latest example of how major health-care players are slowly expanding their reach throughout different segments of the industry.In the past two decades, CVS has acquired an insurance company (Aetna), a pharmacy benefits manager (Caremark), launched its Minute Clinic, and is now expanding into more clinical care services. In addition, it is pursuing a strategy to help to diversify clinical trials.All the major health care companies are in some way pursuing what is known as ""vertical integration,"" or combining their business with other segments of the health industry.Take for example the biggest commercial insurer, United Healthcare (UNH). It has the Optum brand, a pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare provider used in physician's offices, and OptumRx which helps United compete in the pharmacy benefits space.Experts have ongoing worries about the impact of these behemoth companies, especially the quality of care received by patients.But there may not be enough data yet to determine if the benefits — ideally lower costs and better patient adherence to care plans — outweigh the risks of more centralized industry control.A logo outside an Oak Street Health urgent care center is pictured after CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) announced it will buy Oak Street Health Inc (OSH.N) for about $9.5 billion in cash, in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., February 8, 2023. REUTERS/Mike SegarIn a separate, recent report from the New England Journal of Medicine's Catalyst group, CVS chief medical officer Dr. David Fairchild said the pandemic showed patients' affinity for convenience in health care.""I think the health care industry still needs to focus on how to make health care more convenient and accessible because this is what people want and need,"" Fairchild said.Oak Street Health, whose patients are older adults, is focused on a type of payment model that has been long-discussed but which has never taken off in a big way: value-based care.This, according to health economist Craig Garthwaite, is key.""If people have always said the problem with U.S. health care is the fee-for-service system where we don't really have a system to buy health, we have a system to buy health care services and everyone in this system makes money when you consumer more care...this takes away that incentive,"" said Garthwaite, director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.Story continues""They make money, now that they are owned by an insurance company ... when you use less health care,"" Garthwaite explained.But despite being owned by an insurer, the company says it will remain agnostic toward insurers that reimburse it for services.CVS sees growth opportunity in Oak Street, which has already been able to scale to 169 clinics and is expected to reach 300 by 2026. CVS benefits from the transaction as it can contribute to Oak Street patient growth through its channels, as well as driving greater utilization of CVS pharmacy and Caremark, according to CFO Shawn Guertin during a recent earnings call.""There's obviously things we can do for plan design offerings to highlight the Oak network or the Oak clinics. We can do that with the Aetna members. I mentioned Signify before as a potential sort of source of members, but when you just think about the vast array of members that we interact with and the vast array of seniors that we interact with every year, across this company, this is a much wider catch basin if you will for potential growth,"" Guertin said.Analysts have hailed the move, even while criticizing the price tag.David Larsen, an analyst at BTIG, said in a note that this new primary care business, along with its recent acquisition of Signify, makes CVS ""one of the most dominant forces in health care services.""Larsen noted that while the transaction has been talked about for a while — CVS said it had been doing due diligence for 15 months prior — he was ""somewhat surprised at the pace with which the market is moving"" with regard to primary care acquisitions.Cigna (CI) and Walgreens (WBA) recently invested in VillageMD, and Walgreens is acquiring Summit Health for $8.9 billion, while Amazon (AMZN) acquired One Medical (ONEM).Scott Dunn, lead healthcare analyst at CB Insights said major health-care brands like CVS are no longer simply insurers or drug store chains.""These moves demonstrate the continued push by many high-profile pharmacies into fast-growing healthcare markets such as senior care, primary care, and home health,"" Dunn said in a recent note.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SAP SE SAP, Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC, TC Energy Corp. TRP, Extra Space Storage Inc. EXR and MGM Resorts International MGM.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for SAP, Northrop Grumman and TC EnergyThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including SAP SE (SAP), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and TC Energy Corp. (TRP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of SAP have declined -1.4% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry's decline of -9.7%. The company's performance is affected due to continued softness in software licenses and the support business segment, coupled with supply chain constraints, global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability. Also, increasing research &amp; development and sales &amp; marketing expenses to cope with intensifying competition in the cloud space are concerns.However, SAP's Q1 performance benefited from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new ""Rise with SAP"" solution) across all regions. There is momentum in SAP's business technology platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions.The company's restructuring plan is expected to better align its operating models and go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like SAP Build and strategic collaborations bode well.(You can read the full research report on SAP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Northrop Grumman's shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. -8.1%). The company continues to witness strong demand for its products, driven by programs like F-35, Triton and SABR radar Global Hawk. Solid U.S. budgetary provisions make the analyst confident about a solid contract inflow from the Pentagon. Northrop also holds a strong solvency position.However, a comparative analysis of the stock's trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture. The prolonged impact of COVID-19 may cause extended disruptions in its supply chain. High inflation rates across the U.S. might also hurt the stock. It expects further impacts related to the conflict in Ukraine and economic sanctions imposed on Russia.(You can read the full research report on Northrop Grumman here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based TC Energy have underperformed the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry over the past year (-22.1% vs. +4.0%). The company is witnessing continued timing and cost overrun issues over large construction projects, plus the cancellation of Keystone XL, are major overhangs.Story continuesMoreover, further share price appreciation will likely be tied to the progress on its debt reduction front, which sits at a massive C$40.92 billion. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.Nevertheless, TC Energy is predominantly a natural gas pipeline operator, with operations spanning Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. A quality stock with industry-leading wide-moat assets, TC Energy has a secured portfolio of C$34 billion in growth projects.This should support the company's stated dividend growth commitment of 3-5% annually in the future. TC Energy's takeover of its TC Pipelines unit last year has helped it to improve corporate governance and lower the cost of capital.(You can read the full research report on TC Energy here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Extra Space Storage Inc. and MGM Resorts International.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.com                        https://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

The approval is for adolescent patients, aged 12 to less than 18 years of age, who did not respond adequately to treatment with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when the use of other treatments is not recommended.Cibinqo was approved for treating eczema in adults 18 years and older in January 2022. With the label expansion, adolescents with AD will get a new systemic oral option for their disease.In the past year, Pfizer’s stock has declined 11.9% against an increase of 13% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe FDA approval for Cibinqo for adolescents was based on data from the phase III study, JADE TEEN, which evaluated two doses (100 mg and 200 mg) of Cibinqo in adolescent patients (12 to &lt;18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe AD. JADE TEEN is one of the five studies in the JADE clinical development program on Cibinqo. Across the five studies, treatment with Cibinqo led to significant improvements in skin clearance, the extent of disease and severity as well as rapid improvement in itch after two weeks, in certain patients with AD, including adolescent patients.Some other JAK inhibitor medicines are Pfizer’s drug, Xeljanz, AbbVie’s ABBV Rinvoq and Eli Lilly’s LLY Olumiant.Among these, only AbbVie’s Rinvoq is approved to treat moderate-to-severe AD in adults and adolescents. In fact, Rinvoq is approved for treating five indications, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. The medicine contributed $2.5 billion to AbbVie’s total revenues in 2022, rising 52.8% year over year.Eli Lilly’s Olumiant and Pfizer’s Xeljanz are not approved for treating AD.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -7.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -19.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.46 points to a change of +3.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +4.8% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.06 billion and $64.37 billion estimates indicate +2.5% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $16.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of 0%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.34%. The EPS surprise was -0.28%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is United Airlines (UAL). UAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.30. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.12. Over the past 52 weeks, UAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 2,764.99 and as low as 5.79, with a median of 9.32.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is UAL's P/B ratio of 2.36. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 4.63. Over the past 12 months, UAL's P/B has been as high as 4.68 and as low as 1.76, with a median of 2.96.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UAL has a P/S ratio of 0.36. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.52.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, B. de C.V (VLRS), an Transportation - Airline stock with a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and Value grade of A.Furthermore, Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, B. de C.V holds a P/B ratio of 5.99 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 4.63. VLRS's P/B has been as high as 8.19, as low as 3.69, with a median of 5.35 over the past 12 months.These are only a few of the key metrics included in United Airlines and Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, B. de C.V strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

Well, since we are in the midst of New York Fashion Week, designers watching their creations hit the stage, hit the runway for all to see. Our next guest is one of those designers with the big show this past Saturday filled with lots of bright color. Sergio Hudson, creative director of Sergio Hudson Collections, is with us now in studio. You brought the bright colors to us. We love it. Sergio, congratulations on your most recent show. Just set the scene for us just in terms of this year's Fashion Week and how it's compared to what you've seen in the past.SERGIO HUDSON: I think this year with a looming recession everyone was very conscious of that. And I think what we came to realize is I wanted to change the tone of what was happening. Like, OK, you're thinking so dark and gloomy. Let me give you something really bright to look at. And we always go through recessions. But we always come out of them. So I feel like I just wanted to give people some kind of joy as opposed to giving them what they're feeling.- Thank you. We like that. We need a little brightness. How do you think, if at all, the COVID pandemic changed fashion? I know a lot of us just wanted to be comfortable in COVID. And a lot of the men at least have maintained that priority out of it. Have you noticed a shift in fashion?SERGIO HUDSON: I think it's very interesting. If you look at the first part of the pandemic, a lot of us designers had to make a shift. A lot of us started making masks and pajamas and shifting into home, which I did in the beginning. And then there was the shift like, OK, people were like, OK, I'm ready to put clothes back on again. And if you check the main store, a lot of them had their best years on records in 2020 and 2021.Story continuesSo it was like the shift. And people ran back to fashion. And they really wanted to spend a lot of that money that they had been saving in the beginning. So people had the money. And they're like, OK, I'm ready to shop again. And now we're looking at probably the reverse of that. But I think it was very interesting the ups and downs of luxury fashion during the pandemic. A lot of brands saw their-- my brand really took off during the pandemic. But, of course, that was attributed to us dressing First Lady Michelle Obama during inauguration. But that's when my business really became profitable.- That certainly does help. So you've dressed Michelle Obama. You've also dressed the likes of Beyonce as well. When you talk about dressing those types of big names, where do you draw that inspiration, but then also have it be a brand that so many people can relate to at the same time?SERGIO HUDSON: I think when I'm dressing those women-- look, at the end of the they're are real women that want to look beautiful. And that's who I cater to. And they are drawn to me because of the clothes that I put out there. So a lot of times when I dress these women, it's just something that I would normally design. Take the First Lady Michelle Obama's outfit. It was directly from my collection that I had shown the year previous. So it's kind of just like if they're drawn to you, they'll wear your clothes because they're women at the end of the day. And I think that's what people have to remember. If a woman likes the clothes, she's going to wear them, whoever they may be.- And to that point, how do you design for Michelle Obama and Beyonce and then have a line at Target, obviously a very different demographic and perception?SERGIO HUDSON: Well, I mean, the thing about the Target collaboration-- we worked very closely with them to come up with something because, at the end of the day, I'm a luxury brand. I can't reach everyone. And there are people out there that will never be able to afford my clothing. But they supported me from the very beginning. But they can shop at Target and they can have afford their price point. So it's really a gift that Target gave me to be able to reach those people because, at the end of the day, when you're a luxury brand, it's a lot easier to reach those customers than it is to reach the masses because it takes a lot more money to own a Target than to own a brand like mine.- And what was it like working with Target to create this line? And do you have plans to maybe expand that line in the future?SERGIO HUDSON: Well, it was amazing working with them because their access is so great and vast. Any idea that I brought to them and they came back at me with their idea. It was just a great collaboration. But they could do anything. I was shocked at the quality of the work that they did and how fast they could get it out there. At this moment, it was just a collaboration. They do this every year. They pick certain designers. So I don't know. I'm open to it in the future. But as of right now, it was just a one time thing.- Sergio, you recently won an award at the Fifteen Percent Pledge Gala. What is the pledge? Why is it so important to you in your particular industry?SERGIO HUDSON: I think the Fifteen Percent Pledge is important because during the pandemic, the founder, Aurora James, she came up with this idea that, OK, we as Black people in America, we make up 15% of the population, but we take up I think it was like less than 2% of the shelf space in the stores. We should at least have 15% of the shelf space. It was kind of like a duh moment.- Seems common sense.SERGIO HUDSON: It's like, OK, that's cool. We take up this amount of population. But you would not believe the amount of kickbacks she got for just saying it and asking people to pledge to it. But she's done an amazing job of getting it out there. And the award was they have come up with this way to give grants to brands because we are self-funded. I dress all of these people. And people assume that we have some big juggernaut behind us. But it's really us. So it's just a grant to help us keep going.- And Sergio, real quick before we let you go, we know the fashion industry obviously so competitive. If you could give one word of advice for those out there that are trying to break into the fashion industry or start their own line, what would you tell them?SERGIO HUDSON: Be true to yourself and believe in yourself because if you don't know, nobody else will, for sure.- Good tip. Sergio Hudson, appreciate you being here.SERGIO HUDSON: Thank you for having me.- Thanks so much. Want to mention Yahoo is an official sponsor of New York Fashion Week.]"

""Making life better is more than a mission statement at Regions; it’s how our associates approach their daily work and the initiatives we are launching to help more people and communities thrive. Through the Making Life Better Institute, we are not only refining our community engagement strategy, we are unlocking new tools to help Regions and its teams make an even greater impact.""Six key components will be at the heart of initiatives championed by the Making Life Better Institute:Regions Associates in ActionSM: In 2022 alone, Regions associates volunteered 74,000 hours supporting a variety of important causes. Even so, more can be done. So, Regions Associates in Action is an enhanced employee volunteerism program that uses existing technology and an improved communication network to create more opportunities for hands-on work with nonprofits, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs). The program leverages the bank’s popular What a Difference a Day Makes program, which gives associates one paid day off per year to volunteer at an organization of their choice. Volunteer days are in addition to consistent, ongoing volunteerism provided by a range of business groups across the bank.Regions Skills in ServiceSM: Using a skills-based approach, the bank is matching the talents and experience of associates from across the organization with the specific needs of community partners. This targeted approach allows associates with subject-matter expertise in various areas to provide assistance where nonprofits, CDFIs and MDIs can best use it, including by offering financial advice and consultation. This enhanced program further enriches important work already being done by Regions associates in areas served by the bank.Board Service: With formal coaching and training, Regions leaders will have more opportunities to put their passions to work and provide financial management and strategic guidance while helping organizations reach their goals.Financial Education: The company continues to expand its robust Regions Next Step® Financial Wellness program to assist community partners, including nonprofit organizations, K-12 schools and groups who serve people in transition. Many of the courses have a Spanish-language version. Separately, two courses designed for people with cognitive disabilities were recently added to the curriculum, as well.CDFI and MDI Support: To further the bank’s long-term commitment to supporting Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Regions is engaging in executive-led informational sessions and idea-sharing opportunities with organizations in the bank’s footprint. This innovative approach for improved collaboration and technical assistance, along with the Regions Associates in ActionSM and Regions Skills In ServiceSM programs, helps expand access to essential financial services and better support communities, especially underserved populations. These efforts enhance longstanding community lending programs within Regions Bank and the Regions Community Development Corporation.Recognition Programs: To celebrate Regions associates who are dedicated to giving back, the bank has created two new award programs. The Lee Ann Petty Heart of Service Award honors an associate, nominated by a colleague, who has made a significant impact to an organization or their community. A winner will be announced in April. The second award, Regions Community Champions, recognizes associates who have recorded 16 or more volunteer hours during the year.Story continuesThe inaugural 2023 Regions Community Champions group includes almost 900 Regions associates throughout cities and towns served by the bank.""I’m so proud of these associates, who have given at least two full days of their valuable time to support organizations they care deeply about,"" said Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for Regions. ""These dedicated colleagues are living Regions’ mission and values every day by working hand-in-hand with community partners to help achieve our shared goals of fostering inclusive prosperity and making life better in the communities we serve.""For more information about Regions’ community engagement activities, see this link.About Regions Financial CorporationRegions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), with $155 billion in assets, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index and is one of the nation’s largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage products and services.

Gatos Silver, Inc. engages in the exploration and production of precious metals. With the latest financial year loss of US$35m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of US$12m, the US$323m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Gatos Silver will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for the company. View our latest analysis for Gatos Silver Consensus from 2 of the American Metals and Mining analysts is that Gatos Silver is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2022, before turning a profit of US$9.8m in 2023. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around 12 months from now or less. We calculated the rate at which the company must grow to meet the consensus forecasts predicting breakeven within 12 months. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 14% is expected, which seems realistic. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Gatos Silver given that this is a high-level summary, though, keep in mind that generally metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a double-digit growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. The company has managed its capital judiciously, with debt making up 3.2% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are key fundamentals of Gatos Silver which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

(VZ): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-verizon-communications-140002252.html,1676296802,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -4.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has lost 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share, indicating a change of -11.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 points to a change of -8.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -7.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 indicates a change of +1.7% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.2%. The $138.14 billion and $139.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1% and +1.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $35.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was -0.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Aggregate inflows into the U.S. stock market, though concentrated in a few names, has reached levels last seen in 2020-21, according to Vanda Research.Shares of companies linked to artificial intelligence have soared after U.S. firm OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, a chatbot that gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries, snagged a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp.Meme stocks have clawed back some of last year's losses, while shares of larger, tech-focused companies such as Nvidia and Tesla have also joined in the fray.The Nasdaq Composite Index, home of many smaller, more speculative companies as well as the megacaps, is up 13% this year, after a 33% loss in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 index is up about 7%.""We've definitely seen risk appetites return to equity markets this year,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.AI BOOMCompanies building artificial intelligence tools have been among the rally's biggest winners, a move market observers say has been driven in part by retail investors.Big gainers include shares in analytics firm BigBear.ai , which are up 500% this year, and chipmaker Nvidia , up 50%. Meanwhile, Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft jostle to pull ahead in the race for the next big growth driver.Five of the largest Artificial Intelligence ETFs, which offer exposure to firms involved in the development and production of robots or artificial intelligence, have grown assets to $4.27 billion, up 18% this year, compared with a 10% rise in assets for the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ ETF .Story continuesMeanwhile, shares of early meme stocks GameStop and AMC Entertainment have pared some losses after last year's tumble.Not all meme stocks are thriving, however: shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which soared as much as 180% in early February, have retreated to trade down 19% for the year as investors await details on whether the struggling retailer can avoid bankruptcy.CONDITIONS TIGHTMany market participants are quick to draw contrasts between the current rally in speculative names and meme stocks' initial surge in 2021.One key comparison is bond yields, which now offer increased competition to stocks after hitting multi-year highs in 2022 as the Fed tightened monetary policy. Investors have recently recalibrated how high the Fed might raise rates this year amid signs of a stronger-than-expected job market.""The current state of play is undoubtedly more challenging,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note on Thursday.The Fed's rate-hiking campaign has tightened financial conditions relative to two years ago, with the Chicago Fed's U.S. National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) at -0.36, compared to -0.62 in 2021, signaling tighter financial conditions.OPTIONS ACTIONThe return to risk-taking is showing up in record trading volumes in the U.S. options market.Demand for calls, which convey the right to buy stock at a fixed price in the future, has outstripped puts, typically used for bearish wagers, with 1.15 calls traded for every put over the last month, per Trade Alert data.Still, that measure is not as euphoric as in 2021, when it reached a high of two calls traded for every put.SHORTS TAKE AIMWhile retail traders may be rushing in, short sellers - who aim to profit by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back later at a lower price - have been adding to their bets, particularly in the AI space.""Investor enthusiasm is also attracting short-sellers that are skeptical about some of the resulting valuations,"" said Evan Niu, an analyst at Ortex, which tracks real-time short interest data.Short interest for C3.ai stands near an 8-month high of 19%. AI software firm Veritone, SoundHound and BigBear.ai also show a pick up in short interest, Ortex data showed.At the same time, short sellers are digging in their heels on their bets against Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, with short interest at a near 6-month high of 48.6%, per Ortex data.(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Nick Zieminski)]"

Aggregate inflows into the U.S. stock market, though concentrated in a few names, has reached levels last seen in 2020-21, according to Vanda Research.Shares of companies linked to artificial intelligence have soared after U.S. firm OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, a chatbot that gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries, snagged a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp.Meme stocks have clawed back some of last year's losses, while shares of larger, tech-focused companies such as Nvidia and Tesla have also joined in the fray.The Nasdaq Composite Index, home of many smaller, more speculative companies as well as the megacaps, is up 13% this year, after a 33% loss in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 index is up about 7%.""We've definitely seen risk appetites return to equity markets this year,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.AI BOOMCompanies building artificial intelligence tools have been among the rally's biggest winners, a move market observers say has been driven in part by retail investors.Big gainers include shares in analytics firm BigBear.ai , which are up 500% this year, and chipmaker Nvidia , up 50%. Meanwhile, Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft jostle to pull ahead in the race for the next big growth driver.Five of the largest Artificial Intelligence ETFs, which offer exposure to firms involved in the development and production of robots or artificial intelligence, have grown assets to $4.27 billion, up 18% this year, compared with a 10% rise in assets for the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ ETF .Story continuesMeanwhile, shares of early meme stocks GameStop and AMC Entertainment have pared some losses after last year's tumble.Not all meme stocks are thriving, however: shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which soared as much as 180% in early February, have retreated to trade down 19% for the year as investors await details on whether the struggling retailer can avoid bankruptcy.CONDITIONS TIGHTMany market participants are quick to draw contrasts between the current rally in speculative names and meme stocks' initial surge in 2021.One key comparison is bond yields, which now offer increased competition to stocks after hitting multi-year highs in 2022 as the Fed tightened monetary policy. Investors have recently recalibrated how high the Fed might raise rates this year amid signs of a stronger-than-expected job market.""The current state of play is undoubtedly more challenging,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note on Thursday.The Fed's rate-hiking campaign has tightened financial conditions relative to two years ago, with the Chicago Fed's U.S. National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) at -0.36, compared to -0.62 in 2021, signaling tighter financial conditions.OPTIONS ACTIONThe return to risk-taking is showing up in record trading volumes in the U.S. options market.Demand for calls, which convey the right to buy stock at a fixed price in the future, has outstripped puts, typically used for bearish wagers, with 1.15 calls traded for every put over the last month, per Trade Alert data.Still, that measure is not as euphoric as in 2021, when it reached a high of two calls traded for every put.SHORTS TAKE AIMWhile retail traders may be rushing in, short sellers - who aim to profit by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back later at a lower price - have been adding to their bets, particularly in the AI space.""Investor enthusiasm is also attracting short-sellers that are skeptical about some of the resulting valuations,"" said Evan Niu, an analyst at Ortex, which tracks real-time short interest data.Short interest for C3.ai stands near an 8-month high of 19%. AI software firm Veritone, SoundHound and BigBear.ai also show a pick up in short interest, Ortex data showed.At the same time, short sellers are digging in their heels on their bets against Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, with short interest at a near 6-month high of 48.6%, per Ortex data.(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Nick Zieminski)]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +25.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 18.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of -38.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.26 points to a change of -26.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.37 indicates a change of +34% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nvidia.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.3%. The $26.94 billion and $29.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +8.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.5%. EPS of $0.58 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.02%. The EPS surprise was -17.14%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is Cardinal Health (CAH). CAH is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 13.35 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 18.19. Over the past 52 weeks, CAH's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.81 and as low as 9.20, with a median of 11.58.We also note that CAH holds a PEG ratio of 1.15. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CAH's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.62. CAH's PEG has been as high as 8.89 and as low as 1.11, with a median of 2, all within the past year.Another great Medical - Dental Supplies stock you could consider is McKesson (MCK), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.McKesson is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.76 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.33. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 18.19 and average PEG ratio of 1.62.Story continuesMCK's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 15.66 and as low as 11.69, with a median of 14.02, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.56 and as low as 0.99, with a median of 1.43, all within the past year.Furthermore, McKesson holds a P/B ratio of -23.75 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 6.44. MCK's P/B has been as high as -23.48, as low as -59.10, with a median of -33.92 over the past 12 months.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Cardinal Health and McKesson are likely being undervalued right now.

It is certainly time for long-term investors to reevaluate their portfolios and possibly get back in on the growth names that fell out of favor in 2022.Instead of focusing on Tesla and other beaten-down growth names, especially after the insane YTD climb, a more prudent approach might be to buy stocks poised to thrive even if the U.S. economy doesn't reach that goldilocks zone everyone is hoping for.Today we dig into three highly-ranked stocks that outperformed the market in 2022 amid the turmoil and are primed to keep running higher in 2023 even if Wall Street is forced to take its foot off the growth pedal.McKesson CorporationMcKesson is a healthcare products distributor that benefitted both from the covid pandemic and a return to normalcy as more people start receiving regularly scheduled medical care, screenings, and more. McKesson partners with hospitals, doctors' offices, pharmacies, manufacturers, and beyond to help deliver medicines, medical products, and healthcare services.McKesson grows alongside the overall expansion of healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotech, and medical products without having to undertake the massive amounts of research and development that many of the innovators in the space do. McKesson is the largest of the three major drug distributors in the U.S. alongside AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health. MCK has posted over 20 straight years of sales growth outside of one tiny (-0.1%) pullback.Story continuesMcKesson topped Zacks Q3 FY23 estimates on February 1 and provided upbeat EPS guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for its sales to climb 4.3% in FY23 and another 4% in FY24 to $286 billion to help lift its adjusted earnings by 8% and 3%, respectively. MCK also lands an ""A"" VGM grade and its industry is in the top 12% of over 250 Zacks industries right now.McKesson shares have soared roughly 1,300% over the past 20 years vs. the S&amp;P 500's 395%. MCK has also jumped 100% in the past two years to destroy the benchmark's 4% downturn and its industry's 3% gain. MCK stock is up 35% in the last 12 months yet it trades 18% below its average Zacks price target.Wall Street is high on MCK stock and for good reason, with it trading near its own 10-year median and at a 25% discount to its industry despite its massive outperformance at 13.7X forward earnings. And its dividend yields 0.6%.JabilJabil provides manufacturing services with a client list that includes the likes of Apple, SolarEdge, and other giants in critical and game-changing industries. JBL has been a somewhat under-the-radar tech superstar during the last five years.Jabil prides itself on operating in the background, working with hundreds of the biggest brands in the world to help make everything from smartphones and home appliances to healthcare tech. JBL is also set to benefit from a broader onshoring/reshoring push from U.S. companies and the federal government.Jabil's diversification has helped it grow steadily for years, including 14% growth in its fiscal 2022. Most recently, JBL topped our Q1 FY23 estimates in mid-term December and it upped its guidance once again.JBL stock has soared 215% over the last five years vs. the benchmark's 55% and the Zacks Tech sector's 64%. This run includes an 83% surge in the last 24 months as Tech tumbled 17%. Jabil has also managed to outpace tech in 2023 (up 20% YTD vs. 15%) to trade near fresh records.Jabil's valuation levels are somewhat stunning considering its outperformance. JBL trades at a 55% discount to the Zacks Tech sector at 10.1X forward 12-month earnings and 14% below its own 10-year median and 45% under its highs.Zacks estimates call for JBL's revenue to climb 3% in both FY23 and FY24 to hit $35.4 billion. This growth comes on top 12% average sales expansion over the last five years. Jabil's adjusted earnings are projected to climb by over 9% and 6%, respectively.JBL's bottom-line positivity helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. Jabil's Electronics - Manufacturing Services segment is in the top 15% of all of the Zacks industries, and six of the seven brokerage recommendations Zacks has are ""Strong Buys."" And Jabil pays a dividend.HalliburtonHalliburton is an oil field services standout that works throughout the entire lifecycle of a project. Halliburton's products and offerings help oil and gas companies with everything from exploration and well construction all the way to abandonment activities. The entire oil and energy sector benefited from soaring prices last year, and oil prices are holding up better than some expected even though they are well off their records.The ongoing Russian invasion has greatly disrupted global oil and gas supplies. More importantly, fighting and the sanctions have forced a reevaluation of the status quo. Oil exploration and drilling are gradually expanding after years of slowing output as more countries race toward greater energy independence, all of which is music to Halliburton's ears.Perhaps most importantly for near-term and long-term investors, oil is without a doubt going to play a vital role in the U.S. and around the world for years to come even as alternative and renewable energy booms. Halliburton topped our EPS estimate once again on January 24 and raised its outlook, with HAL executives calling for its ""earnings power to strengthen in 2023 and beyond.""Zacks estimates call for Halliburton's FY23 sales to climb 16% and another 11% in FY24 to $26.14 billion. Plus, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 43% this year and 22% in FY24.This outlook showcases its growth runway, stability, and niche within the oil sector as many face a pending downturn after a blowout year. And Halliburton posted 33% revenue growth in 2022 and 99% adjusted earnings expansion.Halliburton's upward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. HAL's industry ranks in the top 32% of over 250 Zacks industries, and it recently raised its dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share. The stock sports an overall ""A"" VGM grade and 13 of the 15 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are ""Strong Buys,"" alongside two ""Buys.""Halliburton stock has soared 99% in the past two years to blow away the Zacks Oil and Energy sector's 55%. HAL shares have jumped 30% in the past six months and they still trade 35% below their average Zacks price target at around $39 per share. On the valuation side, HAL trades at a 15% discount to its industry at 11.8X forward earnings. This also marks a 20% discount to its own five-year median.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

228,2ad1ff9c-6979-37d8-af66-308bd197fc0b,GPC,2023-02-14,Do Fundamentals Have Any Role To Play In Driving Genuine Parts Company's (NYSE:GPC) Stock Up Recently?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fundamentals-role-play-driving-genuine-130800609.html,1676380080,STORY,['GPC'],"[Genuine Parts' (NYSE:GPC) stock is up by 4.0% over the past week. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Genuine Parts'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Genuine Parts is:32% = US$1.2b ÷ US$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.32 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Genuine Parts' Earnings Growth And 32% ROETo begin with, Genuine Parts has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 24% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 6.7% net income growth seen by Genuine Parts over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Genuine Parts' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 26% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is GPC fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Genuine Parts Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?While Genuine Parts has a three-year median payout ratio of 58% (which means it retains 42% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Besides, Genuine Parts has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 49% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Genuine Parts' future ROE will be 31% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Genuine Parts has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates. Dividend-growing companies have histories of consistently increasing their dividend payments, which is particularly beneficial for income investors. Historical returns of dividend stocks have also shown that they have lower price volatility compared to non-dividend stocks.Continuous changes in monetary policies in 2022 altered investor sentiment and brought dividend securities into the limelight. Though S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% last year, dividend companies remained on strong footing, rewarding investors with stable returns. According to a report by ProShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fell by just 6.21% in 2022 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index reported a 0.11% drop, versus a harsher decline of the wider market. Similarly, Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index. These numbers show that dividend growth strategies outperformed the broader market in large-, small-, and mid-cap spaces in the US. Some companies that have consistently raised their dividends include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX).Another report by Allspring Global Investments also highlighted the positive performance of dividend stocks over time.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”13.

232,c4b19776-4336-3027-834f-4d577f609dd2,CMI,2023-02-14,Investors Heavily Search Cummins Inc. (CMI): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cummins-inc-140002411.html,1676296802,STORY,['CMI'],"[Cummins (CMI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this engine maker have returned -2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, which Cummins falls in, has lost 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cummins is expected to post earnings of $4.74 per share, indicating a change of +17.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $19.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +27.3%. This estimate has changed -7.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.71 indicates a change of +2.5% from what Cummins is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Cummins.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cummins, the consensus sales estimate of $7.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +23.8%. The $32.1 billion and $31.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.3% and -1.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCummins reported revenues of $7.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.8%. EPS of $4.52 for the same period compares with $2.85 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.6%. The EPS surprise was -3%.Over the last four quarters, Cummins surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cummins is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cummins. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""For the full year 2022, we earned $2.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.27 on a non-GAAP basis, results that are in the upper half of our guidance range. Over the next four years, Exelon will invest $31 billion to support our jurisdictions’ energy transitions, growing the rate base by 7.9%, and results in our expectations for 6% to 8% annualized growth in operating earnings per share through 2026, off the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. We expect adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings for 2023 of $2.30 - $2.42 per share, in line with the direction provided in our third-quarter earnings call.""Fourth Quarter 2022Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $0.43 per share from $0.31 GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $0.43 per share from $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 5.Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflect:Higher utility earnings primarily due to higher electric distribution earnings at ComEd from higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base, and rate increases at PECO, BGE, and PHI. This was partially offset by higher interest expense at PECO, and higher depreciation expense and credit loss expense at PECO and PHI.Lower earnings at Exelon Corporate primarily due to higher interest expense.Full Year 2022Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for 2022 increased to $2.08 per share from $1.65 GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations per share in 2021. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for 2022 increased to $2.27 per share from $1.83 per share in 2021.Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the full year 2022 primarily reflect:Higher utility earnings primarily due to higher electric distribution and transmission earnings at ComEd from higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base, rate increases at PECO, BGE, and PHI, and decreased storm costs at PECO and BGE. This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, credit loss expense, and interest expense at PECO, BGE, and PHI, and higher storm costs at PHI.Higher earnings at Exelon Corporate due to certain BSC costs that were historically allocated to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Generation) but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s results in the fourth quarter of 2021 as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules, partially offset by higher interest expense.Operating Company Results1ComEdComEd's fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income increased to $211 million from $133 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $211 million from $138 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to increases in electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base). Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.PECOPECO’s fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income decreased to $102 million from $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased to $102 million from $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to increases in depreciation expense, credit loss expense, and interest expense, partially offset by distribution rate increases.BGEBGE’s fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income decreased to $113 million from $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased to $114 million from $121 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in various expenses, offset by favorable impacts of the multi-year plans. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.PHIPHI’s fourth quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income increased to $90 million from $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $90 million from $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to distribution rate increases, lower contracting costs, and timing of excess deferred tax amortization, partially offset by increases in depreciation expense and credit loss expense. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.Initiates Annual Guidance for 2023Exelon introduced a guidance range for 2023 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $2.30-$2.42 per share. The outlook for 2023 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes costs related to the separation.___________1Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware.Recent Developments and Fourth Quarter HighlightsDividend: On February 14, 2023, Exelon’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share on Exelon’s common stock for the first quarter of 2023. The dividend is payable on Friday, March 10, 2023, to shareholders of record of Exelon as of 5 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, February 27, 2023.ComEd Electric Base Rate Case: On January 17, 2023, ComEd filed an application for a four-year cumulative multi-year rate plan for January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2027 with the ICC to increase its electric distribution rates by $877 million effective January 1, 2024, $175 million effective January 1, 2025, $217 million effective January 1, 2026, and $203 million effective January 1, 2027, based on forecasted revenue requirements. The revenue requirement will provide for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 7.43% in 2024, 7.50% in 2025, 7.62% in 2026, and 7.70% in 2027, inclusive of an allowed ROE of 10.50% in 2024, 10.55% in 2025, 10.60% in 2026, and 10.65% in 2027. The requested revenue requirements are based on capital structures that reflect between 50.58% and 51.19% common equity. ComEd’s MRP also includes a proposed rate phase-in to defer approximately $307 million of the $877 million year-over-year increase for 2024 revenue from 2024 to 2026. ComEd currently expects a decision in the fourth quarter of 2023, but cannot predict if the ICC will approve the application as filed.ComEd Distribution Formula Rate: On November 17, 2022, the ICC approved ComEd's electric distribution formula rate of $199 million, which will take effect on January 1, 2023. ComEd’s 2023 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $144 million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2023 and an increase of $55 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2021. The revenue requirement for 2023 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 5.94% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.85%, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The reconciliation revenue requirement for 2021 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 5.91%, inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.78%, reflecting the monthly yields on 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points less a performance metrics penalty of 7 basis points.DPL Maryland Electric Base Rate Case: On December 14, 2022, the MDPSC approved DPL’s three-year multi-year plan for January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. The order approved an incremental increase in DPL’s electric distribution rates of $17 million, $6 million, and $6 million for 2023, 2024, and, 2025, respectively, reflecting an ROE of 9.60%.DPL Delaware Electric Base Rate Case: On December 15, 2022, DPL Delaware filed an application with the DEPSC to increase its annual electric distribution rates by $60 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.50%. DPL currently expects a decision in the second quarter of 2024 but cannot predict if the DEPSC will approve the application as filed.Financing Activities:On October 4, 2022, ComEd entered into a 364-day term loan agreement for $150 million with a variable rate equal to SOFR plus 0.75% and an expiration date of October 3, 2023.

Follow Exelon on Twitter @Exelon.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today launched Akamai Connected Cloud, a massively distributed edge and cloud platform for computing, security, and content delivery that keeps applications and experiences closer and threats farther away.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logoThe new strategic cloud computing services and architecture will be available in Asia Pacific-Japan (APJ) for developers to build, run, and secure highly-performant workloads closer to wherever businesses and users connect online. Akamai announced:Four new enterprise-scale core cloud computing sites across APJ in 2023, in Chennai, Osaka, Jakarta, and Auckland. Like Akamai's existing 11 core sites, including core sites in Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Mumbai,  the new regional sites will plug into the Akamai backbone — connecting them to the most distributed edge network on the planet. The new sites will contain cloud computing services acquired from Linode, and will become the template for additional core sites that Akamai plans to roll out across the globe.More distributed sites. In addition to the planned new core sites, Akamai has identified more than 50 cities globally in which it plans to begin rolling out distributed sites this year, to bring basic cloud computing capabilities into difficult-to reach-locations currently underserved by traditional cloud providers.Aggressive new cloud egress pricing. The new pricing structure is able to use the power of Akamai's network to drive the cost of cloud egress by bringing CDN-like economics to cloud data transfer. The new egress pricing model is designed to result in significantly discounted egress rates relative to the hyperscalers and alternative cloud providers.New ISO, SOC 2 and HIPAA standards compliance, available immediately. The new standards compliance reflects Akamai's focus on the security of its cloud computing services and customer data within, and allows customers to move workloads among Akamai and other public clouds.Akamai Qualified Computing Partner Program. This new technology partner program is designed to provide Akamai customers with solution-based services that are interoperable with Akamai Connected Cloud. The services will be provided by Akamai technology partners that complete a thorough qualification process, ensuring they are readily available to deploy and scale across the globally distributed platform.Story continues""We're taking a fundamentally different approach to cloud computing — building on 25 years of experience scaling and securing the internet for the biggest companies in the world,"" said Dr. Tom Leighton, Akamai's Co-Founder, and CEO. ""Akamai is building the cloud the next decade needs.""""The launch of Akamai Connected Cloud comes at a time where the Asia Pacific &amp; Japan region continues to experience rapid advancements in digital transformation. As organizations look to address the diverse infrastructure and network capabilities across markets, while decreasing costs and increasing agility through multi-cloud and open-source architectures, there are tremendous growth opportunities with the cloud,"" said Parimal Pandya, Senior Vice President, Sales, and Managing Director, Asia-Pacific.In building out Akamai Connected Cloud, Akamai is adding core and distributed sites on top of the same underlying backbone that powers its edge network today — spanning more than 4,100 locations across 134 countries. More specifically, Akamai is placing compute, storage, database, and other services closer to large populations, industry, and IT centers. The result is designed to be a continuum of compute, from core to edge, enabling companies to more efficiently build, deploy, and secure performant workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency and global reach. Industries such as media, gaming, SaaS vendors, retail, and government are examples where these requirements are in high demand today.""Akamai's leadership position at the edge enables us to scale everything we touch: We scale content, putting digital experiences closer to users than anyone. We scale cybersecurity, keeping threats farther away from business and people. Our customers know us and trust us for this scale. Now we plan to scale cloud computing, to provide customers with better performance at a lower cost,"" said Leighton.According to IDC, the public cloud services market in Asia/Pacific is forecasted to reach USD$165.2 billion in 20261, and one in three companies has been predicted to generate more than 30% of their revenues2 from digital products and services in 2023.""The cloud's next phase requires a shift in how developers and enterprises think about getting applications and data closer to their customers. It redefines how the industry looks at things like performance, scale, cost, and security as workloads are no longer built for one place but are delivered across a wide spectrum of compute and geography,"" said Dave McCarthy, Research VP, IDC. ""Akamai's innovative rethinking of how this gets done — and how it is architecting the Akamai Connected Cloud — puts it in a unique position to usher in an exciting new era for technology and to help enterprises build, deploy, and secure distributed applications.""Akamai is already enabling regional customers to manage decentralised application architectures and deliver consistent experiences across their regional operations.Rajkumar Ganapathy, Chief Technology Officer, Zolvit, said, ""One of our key goals was to consolidate our infrastructure for better management, flexibility and to save costs. We were looking for a single cloud provider that aligned with all our requirements and Akamai Connected Cloud was our preferred choice because of their simple, affordable, and accessible infrastructure and superior support that put our team at ease.""Akamai Connected Cloud is under the leadership of Adam Karon, Chief Operating Officer, and General Manager of Akamai's Cloud Technology Group, where he has led teams focused on enabling today's leading media, gaming, and software companies to deliver the best possible experiences — at scale — to their customers on any device, anywhere, and helping carriers operate high-performing and cost-efficient networks.""Cloud is a stepping stone to solving larger business challenges,"" said Karon. ""Business leaders are looking to continue the momentum of digital transformation and stretch the boundaries of what's possible for their organizations in an increasingly digital world. Our distributed scale is designed to deliver highly-performant cloud computing everywhere our customers' business connects online, empowering them with the speed, flexibility, performance, and connectivity they need to grow without compromise, innovate without friction, and delight customers without fail.""For more information, visit our cloud computing solutions page.About Akamai TechnologiesAkamai powers and protects life online.

MMP, a diversified energy infrastructure provider, reported fourth-quarter adjusted net income per unit of $1.06, underperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 and the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.24 per unit.

This segment’s operating margin also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $329 million, hampered by unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments.Meanwhile, transportation and terminal revenues improved by 7.3% to $379.4 million, mostly as a result of increased quarterly transportation volumes and higher average transportation rates.Crude Oil: The operating margin of $128.2 million increased by 23.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $103.8 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $111 million.Meanwhile, transportation and terminal revenues increased by about 8.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $123.8 million, while also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $114 million due to higher terminal throughput fees as well as higher average Longhorn pipeline rates.Story continuesIncreased shipments on the Houston distribution system, which moves at a reduced average tariff, partially due to a new pipeline connection in 2022, resulted in an increased overall volume shipment and a decreased average rate.Distributable Cash FlowMagellan Midstream’s DCF for the fourth quarter was $ 344.7 million, up 16.1% from last year’s figure of $296.8 million.MMP increased its free cash flow after distributions in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $109.1 million, up from $70 million a year ago.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, MMP sets its DCF guidance at $1.18 billion, while net income should come at around $975 million.MMP projects free cash flow (FCF) of $1.07 billion for the full-year 2023 or $216 million after distributions.The annual net income per unit is estimated at $4.80 for 2023, with the first-quarter guidance of $1.20 per unit.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMagellan Midstream Partners, L.P. is a Tulsa, OK-based company that operates as a master limited partnership.

GSR is a deep-sea mineral exploration division focused on developing and exploring polymetallic nodules, which contain metals crucial for renewable energy and high-capacity batteries.Transocean will offer the use of the Ocean Rig Olympia vessel, along with engineering services and a nominal cash investment to support GSR's exploration work. The rig is specifically designed to operate in challenging conditions and in water depths of up to 12,000 feet. Transocean and GSR both aim to convert the vessel for a test in 2025 to check the feasibility of commercially recovering deep-sea polymetallic nodules in ultra-deep waters.This investment combines Transocean's ultra-deepwater experience with GSR's nodule collection technology to deliver a commercially viable nodule recovery enterprise. The presence of critical minerals, such as cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and rare earth metals in deep-sea polymetallic nodules is vital for producing high-capacity batteries and other applications.With demand for critical minerals on the rise, numerous governments and private companies are developing plans to address the expected scarcity of these minerals in the future. Recovering deep-sea polymetallic nodules in a responsible manner can help fulfill this increasing demand and create a new, significant source of supply. Transocean's CEO sees this investment as a means of providing essential offshore energy services to meet future global energy demands.Transocean's partnership with GSR marks an important milestone in the development of the deep-sea mining industry.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:6.0% = US$4.9b ÷ US$82b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.06 in profit.Does Comcast Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Comcast has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Media industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 4 risks we have identified for Comcast.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Comcast's Debt And Its 6.0% Return On EquityComcast does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.20. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Comcast may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

That will force customers of Xfinity TV and broadband to choose between giving up the service or paying for the ad-supported network (which normally carries a $4.99 per month fee).New customers will no longer receive the offer beginning April 3. And existing customers will see it disappear on June 26. This comes after Peacock did away with its free ad-supported service last month.Comcast plans to offer users who currently receive Peacock for free a discounted rate, but that has not yet been determined.Peacock, as of the end of last year, has 20 million paid subscribers, which is nearly double where it stood at the end of 2021. However, the service is still not profitable.Streaming services are increasingly moving away from focusing on subscriber numbers and turning their attentions to profitability. That’s resulting in price increases that are making customers reevaluate their loyalty to the channels.That’s what has fueled the rise in ad-supported versions of Netflix, HBO Max, and others in the past year. Subscriber signups are slowing down as the market becomes saturated. Research indicates that U.S. consumers subscribe to 4.7 streaming services on average. To achieve growth, a subscription-based platform must displace a competitor—an increasingly difficult task. The other option is to offer a low-cost or free ad-supported tier.To lure those paying subscribers, services are offering more exclusive programming; Peacock has current hits with both Yellowstone and Rian Johnson’s Poker Face. It also has an exclusive window for films from Universal, streaming the films for four months before other services are able to do so.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

In the United Kingdom, Sky has nearly completed construction of Sky Studios Elstree that will feature over 160,000 square feet of solar panels on the roofs of buildings, with any additional energy required also coming from a renewable source.Across the enterprise, we're continuing to work to reduce fleet emissions by piloting electric and hybrid vehicles in select locations, installing telematics and fuel efficiency technology, and offering digital support tools that have allowed us to eliminate 4.8 million truck visits, saving more than 7.6 million gallons of gasoline and avoiding 67,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.In 2022 we also announced plans to deploy new, energy-efficient technologies across our network that by 2030 we estimate will avoid the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power half a million homes for a year.A view of our value chainAnother significant accomplishment in 2022 was estimating the emissions of our full value chain, known as Scope 3 emissions. Comcast's Scope 3 emissions, now included in our Carbon Footprint Data Report, reflect estimates of the upstream emissions associated with our suppliers as well as the downstream emissions associated with our customers' use of our products and services.Story continuesBecause Scope 3 emissions occur from sources owned or controlled by entities outside of our control, they are more difficult to calculate compared to Scope 1 and 2 emissions and use many estimates that are based on a combination of measured and estimated emissions data. Given these inherent data limitations and inconsistent estimation techniques among companies, comparison of Scope 3 values across companies or placing undue reliance on Scope 3 estimates is not recommended.Estimating the emissions of our full value chain was an important step for us to join the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), one of the key organizations focused on aligning corporate climate action with the global climate goals set by the Paris Agreement. By joining SBTi, Comcast has committed to set near-term emission reduction goals in line with pathways designed to limit global warming.Collaboration for the futureWorking to address the impact across our value chain and overcoming the broader challenges of decarbonizing society at large will require increased collaboration with a range of business partners, industry peers, governments around the world, and other stakeholders.For example, we plan to seek information from our larger suppliers on their emission reduction plans, and our Supplier Code of Conduct includes guidance on business continuity and sustainable practices. We'll also continue our longstanding collaboration with industry peers to collectively improve the energy efficiency of TV set-top boxes and small network equipment to reduce downstream emissions and save customers money on their energy bills.We're proud of the work being done throughout the enterprise to move us closer to our carbon neutral goal and will continue to evolve and refine our plans to support sustainability across our business. We look forward to sharing more progress along the way.1 Source: https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator2 Source: https://www.ncta.com/media/media-room/industry-initiative-saves-consumers-25-billion-in-annual-energy-costsForward-Looking StatementsThis article includes estimates, projections and statements regarding plans and goals that may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and p 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(NYSE:PRU) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $1.25 on the 16th of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the dividend yield to 4.9%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial Prudential Financial Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Even though Prudential Financial isn't generating a profit, it is generating healthy free cash flows that easily cover the dividend. This gives us some comfort about the level of the dividend payments.The next 12 months is set to see EPS grow by 168.8%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could reach 197%, which probably can't continue without putting some pressure on the balance sheet.historic-dividendPrudential Financial Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.60 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $5.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though Prudential Financial's EPS has declined at around 20% a year. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

This oil and gas company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.35% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors at PlayThe acquisitions of RimRock Oil and Gas LP in the Williston Basin and Validas Energy in the Eagle Ford Shale are expected to have contributed positively to Devon’s fourth-quarter earnings. However, the severe winter weather conditions during fourth-quarter in Devon’s service territories adversely impacted production volumes and the Williston Basin operation was most impacted. As a consequence, the company expects its production volumes to be down by 2% from its prior expected range of 640,000-660,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d).Devon Energy’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to benefit from its ongoing share repurchases. In the first nine months of 2022, the company repurchased shares worth $1.25 billion. Devon’s low-cost structure and strong commodity prices are likely to have boosted fourth-quarter earnings.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share and total revenues are currently pegged at $1.77 and $4.65 billion, respectively, which reflects year-over-year growth of 23.7% and 8.8%, respectively.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Devon Energy this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Rises: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 761 for the week ended Feb 10. The figure is higher than the prior week’s count of 759. Thus, the tally increased in two of the past five weeks. The current national rig count is also higher than the year-ago level of 635.The onshore rigs in the week ended Feb 10 totaled 741, lower than the prior week's count of 745. In offshore resources, 18 rigs were operating, however, higher than the prior week’s count of 12.U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises: The oil rig count was 609 in the week ended Feb 10, higher than the prior-week figure of 599. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is up from the year-ago figure of 516.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Decreases: Natural gas rig count of 150 is lower than the prior-week figure of 158. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is, however, higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 118. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.7% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 18 units, lower than the prior-week count of 21 units. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 743 is higher than the prior-week level of 738.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Rises: GoM rig count was 18 units, all oil-directed. The count was higher than the prior-week number of 12.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 350, higher than the prior week's count of 345. Thus, the number increased after declining for three straight weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $75-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.United Rentals (URI) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this equipment rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for United Rentals is 16.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3.2%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for United Rentals is 25.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 17.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for United Rentals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 11.5% over the past month.Bottom LineUnited Rentals has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that United Rentals is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: MercadoLibre Inc. MELI, Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, United Rentals Inc. URI, Chewy Inc. CHWY and Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy Stocks Flying High Year to Date with More UpsideU.S. stock markets are rallying this year despite occasional fluctuations. Although it is too early to take a decision, market participants have regained confidence in risky assets like equities to some extent after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have rallied 1.7%, 6.3% and 12.6%, respectively.This trend is expected to continue as the rate of inflation and consequently the magnitude of the Fed's interest rate hike has declined. Buoyed by the early 2023 rally, several stocks have popped. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong upside left.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said ""We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.""Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell's recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Story continuesPeak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.U.S. Economy Is CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter's growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy will expand by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities are the primary reasons for job cuts. Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the U.S. labor market remains resilient. Nonfarm payrolls in January came in at 517,000 well above the consensus estimate of 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, below the consensus mark of 3.6%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have rallied more than 20% year to date.

Without rural hospitals, millions of Americans could face delays and travel challenges to seek the diagnosis, treatment, and care they may need. To better help serve their communities, 32 new clients selected Oracle Cerner CommunityWorks last year, including OSS Health and Pioneers Memorial Healthcare District.Oracle CernerOracle Cerner CommunityWorks is designed to meet the unique needs of smaller communities.

""Because rural providers are often caring for their neighbors, they know their patients well. With limited resources and staffing challenges, they need the right tools to expand access to quality care that will allow them to do the most with what they have. Our technology is tailored to support them, offering a more personalized and simplified experience for both patients and providers.""More patients in smaller communities to benefit from integrated health recordHealthcare providers in small communities are often challenged with how to do more with less while trying to provide the best care for their patients.

Oracle Cerner technology provides clinicians with an integrated digital record of the patient's health history, including clinical and financial data.Story continuesOne example is OSS Orthopedic Hospital, LLC dba OSS Health, in rural Pennsylvania, which seeks to consolidate their disparate ambulatory and hospital systems into a single digital patient record.

HAS is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.2%.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share, indicating a gain of 11.6% from $1.21 reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.68 billion, suggesting a decline of 16.8% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Hasbro, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHasbro, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHasbro, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hasbro, Inc. QuoteLet’s analyze the factors that are likely to have made an impact this earnings season.Factors to NoteHasbro’s fourth-quarter top line is likely to have been negatively impacted by the dismal performance of Partners Brands, Hasbro Gaming and TV, Film &amp; Entertainment. Increasing price sensitivity for the average customers is also likely to have impacted the company’s revenues.We expect Partners Brands, Hasbro Gaming and TV, Film &amp; Entertainment revenues to decline 0.8%, 5.9% and 12.1% to $391.1 million, $269.1 million and $303.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, we expect Franchise Brands and Emerging Brands revenues to increase 0.1% and 1.1% to $831 million and $159.2 million, respectively.However, the company is likely to have benefited from solid growth in its e-com revenues, increased focus on eOne Content, strong gaming demand and product development. The company has been benefiting from robust growth in markets like Europe, North America and Latin America.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Hasbro this time around.

275,d97b0185-7228-3280-8dfb-58ad6df90a90,MCD,2023-02-14,"With 70% ownership of the shares, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/70-ownership-shares-mcdonalds-corporation-110103963.html,1676372463,STORY,['MCD'],"[If you want to know who really controls McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about McDonald's. See our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that McDonald's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 4.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$182m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in McDonald's. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with McDonald's , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

Oh my god’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-ordering-system-isn-t-105505457.html,1676372105,STORY,['MCD'],"[Nine sweet teas. Two pats of butter. Four sides of ketchup. A caramel sundae. These are among the unwanted items baffled customers have received as fast food chain McDonald’s continues to roll out its robot ordering system.The restaurant giant’s A.I. venture has been a long time in the making. In 2021, it announced a joint venture with IBM to “further accelerate the development of its automated order taking (AOT) technology.”Some 14,000 sites are expected to get the technology, McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski has said, but some teething problems are already being raised by customers.One video posted to TikTok by a user named Madilynn Cameron shows two women in a car driving up to one of the automatic screens. Attempting to buy a cup of ice cream and a bottle of water, the pair become increasingly bewildered as the A.I. continues to add unwanted items.“Cream packet? No! I just want a large water and a cup of ice cream. Not a ketchup packet! Oh, my God,” the customer exclaims to the bot—which can be heard asking questions in the background.“Where did the butter come from? I would just like a large water and a cup of ice cream,” she says laughing, and shows viewers her order on the screen. A companion in the background is heard advising that perhaps the pair should just order inside the restaurant.The pair drive away after the customer once again attempts to buy a cup of ice cream and is asked what toppings she would like. “None, nothing, nada!” she says, before sighing when a caramel sundae appears at the bottom of her order.https://www.tiktok.com/@themadivlog/video/7166671795263819054?embed_source=121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_blanku0026refer=embedu0026referer_url=www.businessinsider.com%2Ftiktokers-show-failures-with-mcdonalds-drive-thru-ai-robots-2023-2%3Fr%3DUS%26IR%3DTu0026referer_video_id=7166671795263819054Other users have posted similar experiences. Three days ago, a video from Ren Adams shows a screenshot of an order with nine large sweet iced teas, a large Diet Coke, and hash browns.Story continuesShe explains: “This morning I tried to go to McDonald’s and get my daily dose of caffeine and some breakfast. I was going to get a hash brown, a sweet tea, and a Coke. So I order, and I’m at the first drive-thru line, and as I order a car pulls up to the second drive-thru line.https://www.tiktok.com/@resinsbiren/video/7198528478533258542?embed_source=121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_maskingu0026refer=embedu0026referer_url=www.distractify.com%2Fp%2Fmcdonalds-ai-customer-9-sweet-teasu0026referer_video_id=7198528478533258542“At this McDonald’s it’s all robot, there’s no person. So she [the robot] adds the Diet Coke from the next line to my screen. Tell me why when I tell the robot that I have no Diet Coke, for some reason, she took it off and made it nine sweet teas. Nine!“I did not ask for this. I pulled out of the drive-thru and drove away.”The videos have now been viewed tens of thousands of times. Commenters weighed in: “And this is exactly why a person should take your order.” Another added: “I don’t want to talk to anyone (including robots). I just order from the app. So much easier.”85% accuracyMcDonald’s boss Kempczinski previously revealed positive feedback for AOT, saying restaurants using the technology were seeing 85% accuracy. Speaking at Alliance Bernstein’s Strategic Decisions conference in 2021, he added that at the time 10 locations in Chicago were using the technology and as a result staff were taking just 20% of orders.He continued that the brand may also look to automate some of its kitchen areas, such as fryer and grill stations, but added that even though it might be possible now, it won‘t be implemented within the next five years.McDonald’s did not immediately respond when contacted by Fortune for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates. Dividend-growing companies have histories of consistently increasing their dividend payments, which is particularly beneficial for income investors. Historical returns of dividend stocks have also shown that they have lower price volatility compared to non-dividend stocks.Continuous changes in monetary policies in 2022 altered investor sentiment and brought dividend securities into the limelight. Though S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% last year, dividend companies remained on strong footing, rewarding investors with stable returns. According to a report by ProShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fell by just 6.21% in 2022 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index reported a 0.11% drop, versus a harsher decline of the wider market. Similarly, Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index. These numbers show that dividend growth strategies outperformed the broader market in large-, small-, and mid-cap spaces in the US. Some companies that have consistently raised their dividends include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX).Another report by Allspring Global Investments also highlighted the positive performance of dividend stocks over time. The report mentioned that dividend growers delivered the best risk/return relation in 30 years ending December 2020.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:We first listed down stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats group, the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. From these stocks, we shortlisted companies with dividend growth rates of at least 8% in the past 12 months. These growth rates go up to 31%, as you will see in the article. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend growth rates.Story continuesDividend Growth Stocks with the Highest Growth Rates15. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)12-Month Dividend Growth Rate: 8.1%Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) specializes in the production of construction equipment. The company is based in Texas, US. For Q4 2022, it reported strong results with revenue of $16.6 billion, which showed a 20.3% growth from the same period last year.

(NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is also among investors' preferred dividend stocks.Following the company's recent quarterly earnings, Credit Suisse raised its price target on Caterpillar Inc.

Here is what the firm had to say:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”14. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)12-Month Dividend Growth Rate: 8.5%Another best dividend growth stock on our list is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), which is an American medical device and healthcare company. In January, Barclays raised its price target on the stock to $125 with an Overweight rating on the shares as the company reported growth in its medical device business.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.89%, as of February 13.

The collective value of these stakes is over $3 billion.Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”13. Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF)12-Month Dividend Growth Rate: 8.7%Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF) is an Ohio-based insurance company that provides services in property and casualty insurance. In the past 12 months, the company has raised its dividend by 8.7%, which makes it one of the best dividend growth stocks on our list.

If you want to see more ETFs in this selection, check out Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs to Buy. Many experts believe 2023 will witness even more fluctuations in the markets than last year, with the presence of factors such as high inflation levels, job cuts by technology companies, increasing interest rates, and international uncertainties. As a result, investors will be seeking methods to minimize risk and broaden their investment portfolios. Christopher Huemmer, senior investment strategist at FlexShares ETFs, told Fox Business on February 6: “The biggest driver investors need to prepare for in the upcoming year is volatility. We have seen an increase in the number of volatility spikes across both equity and fixed-income markets.”As per Huemmer, ETFs as an investment vehicle do not guarantee the reduction of portfolio risk by themselves. However, the advancements in the design of ETFs and the indexes they track offer the potential for investors to manage their risk. He highlighted that one such approach could be a focus on quality, low-risk stocks which can be easily incorporated into an investor's equity allocation. This strategy aims to provide some protection against losses while still allowing the investor to remain invested in the equity markets.Morgan Stanley, which played a crucial role in the establishment of the ETF industry, is making its return to the segment after 30 years. This could mark a significant moment for the investment community. Morgan Stanley's return to the ETF industry could have a major impact on the $6.9 trillion US ETF market. Previously, there were only a small number of major financial institutions without a presence in the industry, including Capital Group and Dimensional Fund Advisors. However, Morgan Stanley stands out with its control of approximately $5.5 trillion of assets through its wealth and investment management divisions, including billions invested in ETFs. The possibility that some of these assets could be redirected to its own ETFs increases the likelihood of Morgan Stanley quickly becoming a disruptive force in the industry. Anthony Rochte, Morgan Stanley’s global head of ETFs, told Bloomberg on February 1: Story continues“This is the first step in a series of launches. While we’re focusing on the US, we’re certainly working on a parallel launch in Europe down the road.”Some of the stocks that diversified ETFs offer exposure to include Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and ASML Holding N.V.

(NYSE:DHI), the number one homebuilder by volume in the U.S., gained 31% in the most recent quarter following strong business results.We are bullish about the long-term prospects for D.R. Horton primarily due to two key considerations: 1) We believe the company is positioned to perform well over time given its status as the largest and lowest-cost producer in the entrylevel home segment for first-time buyers and baby boomers looking for an affordable home. In the last fiscal year, approximately 67% of D.R. Horton’s home sales were for prices less than $400,000, thereby enabling the company to satisfy the home affordability constraints of many potential home buyers.2) We are enthusiastic about D.R. Horton’s continued transition to a stronger and more asset-light balance sheet by outsourcing its land development spending needs to third-party developers such as Forestar Group Inc. D.R. Horton’s transition to a less capital-intensive business model is leading to stronger cash-flow generation, lower debt levels, an ability to pursue more share repurchases and/or other investment opportunities, and a higher-valuation multiple.”12.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”   Click to continue reading and see Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs to Buy.  Suggested articles:15 Most Sustainable Companies in the World10 Companies that Make Money During A Recession25 Biggest Connecticut Companies and Stocks Disclosure: None.

Full-time workers have seniority over part-time workers, who could be replaced if reassigned workers opt to change duties.UPS has announced plans to lay off so-called 22.4 drivers, a lower-paid category of drivers created during the last round of negotiations in 2018, Washington State's Teamsters Local 174 said in a web posting dated Feb. 9. The union, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment, did not say how many positions would be affected .Some New York locals also have reported the layoffs, according to Business Insider, which first reported the news.National talks are scheduled to start on April 17 in Washington, D.C.A break-down in talks between UPS and the union could have major consequences for the national economy and a global supply chain that is beginning to recover from the shock of the early pandemic.The first and only strike at UPS in 1997 lasted for 15 days, impeded the shipment of goods, cost the company $850 million and sent some customers to rivals.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Aurora Ellis)]"

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressThe Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$181, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 20% of Stephen Squeri's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of American Express shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. American Express insiders own about US$193m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About American Express Insiders?The fact that there have been no American Express insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the American Express insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing American Express.

286,1bdfc9c0-6749-3d82-99b3-baa8724419c7,MLM,2023-02-14,Investing in Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) five years ago would have delivered you a 69% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-martin-marietta-materials-nyse-174934012.html,1676310574,STORY,['MLM'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Martin Marietta Materials share price has climbed 62% in five years, easily topping the market return of 44% (ignoring dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Martin Marietta Materials managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Martin Marietta Materials has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Martin Marietta Materials' TSR for the last 5 years was 69%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Martin Marietta Materials shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 4.1% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 8.4%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 11% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Martin Marietta Materials   (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.Story continuesFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The company’s third-quarter earnings were at par with the estimate.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to reflect in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderPPL Corporation’s fourth-quarter results are likely to gain from ongoing capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, and completion of the Narragansett Electric acquisition during the first half of 2022.Fourth-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from PPL’s cost management initiatives, which are likely to have lowered operation expenses in fourth-quarter 2022 and boosted earnings.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 28 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 27.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.59 billion, implying a year-over-year decline of 6.9%.Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PPL this time around.

They may pass on these savings to customers in the form of reduced fees.Online banks may offer higher APYs: Fewer overhead costs can also translate to higher APYs on savings products.You could benefit from a wider range of digital tools: Online banks with a strong digital presence may invest more in online and mobile banking platforms to make up for the lack of a brick-and-mortar presence. As a result, you could have access to a wider range of digital budgeting and account management tools, customer service options, and more.ConsFor customers who like the option of walking into a physical branch, online-only banks may not be the best fit. Sometimes resolving an issue related to your account is better handled by working with a teller face-to-face, especially for customers who aren’t as digitally savvy.If you deposit cash frequently, an online-only bank could end up costing you more in fees. Because online-only banks don’t have physical branches, you’ll need to ensure that you find one that offers a fee-free ATM network. In the event that they don’t, it could be challenging to make cash deposits and you’ll likely be responsible for a fee each time you do deposit cash.Frequently asked questionsHow do you keep your online bank account safe?Be sure to change your password regularly to keep your account secure and less susceptible to being hacked. You can also opt to use multi-factor authentication on your phone or laptop, which adds another layer of security each time you’re logging into your account by asking for a text, email, or phone-call verification code.Do online banks charge higher fees?Fees vary from bank to bank, but generally online-only banks tend to charge lower fees than banks with brick-and-mortar locations because these institutions don’t have to pay the same overhead costs that banks with physical locations do.Is my money safe in an online bank?Your money is just as safe in an online bank or credit union as it is in a brick-and-mortar institution. What’s important to make note of is a bank’s deposit insurance. Be sure to verify that your financial institution is fully backed by the FDIC or NCUA.Our methodology The Fortune RecommendsTM team compared more than 30 online banks and credit unions to help you find the best institution to help you meet your needs. Our top picks are available to customers across the U.S. no matter where you’re located, subject to the terms of account, product, and service. Some of our picks have brick-and-mortar locations; however, all of our picks offer online banking for customers nationwide.To come up with our final list, we we ranked the best online banks on the following categories and weighted each category as set forth in the percentages below:Annual percentage yield (APY) on your checking and savings account balance (40%): This percentage represents the real rate of return on your checking and savings account balance; the higher the APY, the better. For accounts with tiered APYs, we assumed a minimum balance of $5,000 based on the latest date from the Federal Reserve and weighed APYs based on the most basic checking or savings account offered.Account and product offerings (15%): We rewarded each online bank a point for each account type and service it offered. This included additional deposit accounts, investment accounts, lending services, credit cards, and more.Overdraft fee (10%): Most banks will charge you a fee when you spend more than what you have in your account. We ranked online banks with lower or zero overdraft fees higher on our list.Monthly service fees (20%): Some banks charge monthly maintenance fees. We ranked banks with lower or zero monthly fees higher on the list.Mobile application rating (5%): We calculated the average mobile application rating for each bank or credit union using ratings from the App Store and Google Play. We rewarded online banks that had a higher average mobile application rating.Free ATM access (10%): Accounts belonging to financial institutions that have a vast network of surcharge-free ATMs ranked higher on our list than alternatives that did not offer ATM access.Customer service (5%): Top picks offer customers three ways to get in contact: chat support, by phone, or even email. Among the three options, we gave phone support the most weight.We think that the best online banks offer a wide range of product offerings, free ATM access, low or zero monthly service fees and minimum balance requirements, and interest earnings on your balance, among other perks. The requirements, fees, and account perks offered by these online banks may be available for limited time periods, and APYs are subject to fluctuation, which could impact how much interest you earn. All the banks and credit unions on this list are insured by the FDIC and NCUA respectively.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

It is worth considering Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.This beauty products retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 22.74%.For the last reported quarter, Ulta came out with earnings of $5.34 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.09 per share, representing a surprise of 30.56%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $4.96 per share and it actually produced earnings of $5.70 per share, delivering a surprise of 14.92%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Ulta, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ulta has an Earnings ESP of +8.53% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

In-home air monitoring has not shown any detections of substances related to the incident and does not indicate a health risk.Thousands of data points have been collected during outdoor air monitoring in the community and continues to indicate no risk to health from incident-related substances.Sampled the Village of East Palestine's drinking water supply wells, drinking water system, and private wells in areas potentially impacted by the incident. Sample results will be available in the next week. Established a Well Task Force to install monitoring points around the impacted waterways and incident site.Started excavating soil from the incident site and sampling the soil before safe disposal.Contacting residents on well water in the vicinity of the derailment to conduct water testing, which encompasses 38 wells. That testing will be done in conjunction with environmental and health agencies, and we will continue to work with them to identify other private drinking water wells for testing.Residents who want air and water testing should contact the Residential Re-Entry Request Hotline at (330) 849-3919.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230214005228/en/HighlightsQuarterly / Full-Year PerformanceRevenues: For the quarter, net revenues were strong, growing 7% to $10.1 billion. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 15%. Organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across operating segments and included 12% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. The quarter also benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments. For the full year, net revenues grew 11% to $43.0 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 16%. This performance was driven by 11% growth in price/mix and 5% growth in concentrate sales.Story continuesOperating margin: For the quarter, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 20.5% versus 17.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 22.7% versus 22.1% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 25.4% versus 26.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 28.7% in both the current year and the prior year. For both the quarter and the full year, operating margin benefited from strong topline growth but was unfavorably impacted by the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, currency headwinds and items impacting comparability.Earnings per share: For the quarter, EPS declined 16% to $0.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) was even at $0.45. EPS performance included the impact of a 12-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of an 11-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS declined 3% to $2.19, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 7% to $2.48. EPS performance included the impact of an 11-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 10-point currency headwind.Market share: For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (""NARTD"") beverages, which included share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels.Cash flow: Cash flow from operations was $11.0 billion for the full year, a decline of $1.6 billion versus the prior year, as strong business performance was more than offset by the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year, and higher tax payments and annual incentive payments in 2022. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.5 billion, a decline of $1.7 billion versus the prior year.Company UpdatesEvolving company leadership to fuel growth: The company continues to focus on having the right leaders and organizational structure to deliver on its growth strategy, while also developing talent for the future. Through recent leadership appointments, the company continued to optimize its organizational design, connecting functions end-to-end while identifying key opportunities to drive meaningful growth over the long term. During the quarter, John Murphy began an expanded role as President and Chief Financial Officer, and added oversight of Global Ventures, Bottling Investments, Platform Services, customer and commercial leadership, and online-to-offline digital transformation. The company also named Henrique Braun to the newly created role of President, International Development to oversee seven of the company’s nine operating units. Braun will steward growth of the consumer base across developing and emerging markets as well as developed markets. Braun will partner with Nikos Koumettis, President of the Europe operating unit, and Jennifer Mann, President of the North America operating unit, on global operational strategy in order to scale best practices and help ensure the company captures growth opportunities across all of its markets.Leveraging digital engagement to connect with more consumers: By linking consumption occasions with consumer passion points, the company is building deeper connections with consumers and reaching them in new and unique ways. The company successfully executed on the Coca-Cola® ""Believing is Magic"" global campaign for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 by creating end-to-end, digitally driven experiences. The company developed its own digital platform, the Coca-Cola Fan Zone, which was activated in 41 markets and featured social experiences for soccer fans. Approximately 5 million consumers interacted with this platform. Through an exclusive partnership with Panini, the official licensed sticker album of FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, soccer fans were able to trade physical and digital stickers, which drove approximately 28 million product label scans, up approximately 400% versus the 2018 FIFA World Cup.Progressing on ambitious packaging goals: The company continues to collaborate with partners to address challenges and create a circular economy for packaging. The company has built a broad spectrum of partnerships to help accelerate progress toward our 2030 packaging collection goal. In India, the company partnered with the grocery delivery service Zepto for a ""return and recycle"" initiative for PET bottles. Consumers can access the ""Return PET Bottles"" feature on the Zepto app, where they can opt to return four empty PET bottles, to be collected by Zepto riders. This initiative establishes an organized process of PET bottle collection with full traceability to help ensure effective plastic waste management. In Latin America, the company partnered with the food aggregator Rappi to collect empty PET bottles. In the Philippines, the company is transitioning the existing PET packaging of some of its brands to 100% recycled PET, excluding caps and labels, utilizing new sources of recycled PET from the joint venture investment PETValue, the first bottle-to-bottle recycling facility in the country. The new packaging formats for Coca-Cola® Original Taste and Wilkins® Pure will expand the company’s lineup in recycled plastic packaging in the country. The company also has approximately 50% of its portfolio in the country in returnable glass bottles.Building a fit-for-purpose balance sheet: The company is focused on having a balance sheet that supports sustainable value creation. In 2022, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Cambodia to Swire Coca-Cola Limited, a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited, and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Egypt to Coca-Cola HBC AG. The company also announced the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam, which was completed in January 2023, and the company agreed to sell its stake in the bottler in Pakistan. Additionally, once market conditions become more favorable, the company intends to list Coca-Cola Beverages Africa as a publicly traded company via an initial public offering, which we believe will occur subsequent to 2023. The company continually evaluates the most effective use of capital to align with its objective of focusing resources on building consumer-loved brands and driving growth.Update on ongoing tax litigation with the IRS: In November 2020, the U.S. Tax Court (""Tax Court"") issued an opinion in the company’s 2015 transfer pricing litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), in which the Tax Court predominantly sided with the IRS. The company intends to assert its claims on appeal and vigorously defend its position. In this opinion, the Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the company’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issued its opinion in a separate case involving the 3M Company. The Tax Court issued that opinion in the 3M case on February 9, 2023. As previously disclosed, the company expects that the Tax Court will now proceed to consider the impact of the 3M opinion on the company’s case and ultimately issue a final decision in the company’s case. The potential impact of the 3M decision for the payment of royalties in the company’s case is already reflected in the company’s previously disclosed estimates of the amounts of potential additional tax and interest that could become due if the IRS were ultimately to prevail in the courts.Operating Review – Three Months Ended December 31, 2022Revenues and VolumePercent ChangeConcentrateSales1Price/MixCurrencyImpactAcquisitions,Divestituresand StructuralChanges, NetReported NetRevenuesOrganicRevenues2Unit CaseVolume3Consolidated212(8)1715(1)Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa(6)15(16)0(7)9(5)Latin America626(7)025322North America1120114120Asia Pacific87(14)2315(1)Global Ventures435(13)0(5)88Bottling Investments214(12)04161Operating Income and EPSPercent ChangeReportedOperatingIncomeItems ImpactingComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparableCurrency NeutralOperatingIncome2Consolidated2413(10)21Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa(18)4(17)(5)Latin America22(2)(10)34North America6(6)012Asia Pacific6(6)(9)22Global Ventures(71)(17)0(55)Bottling Investments(15)10(7)(18)Percent ChangeReported EPSItems ImpactingComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparableCurrency NeutralEPS2Consolidated(16)(16)(11)11Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.1For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any.2Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities.Share repurchases: In 2022, the company issued $0.8 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees, and the company purchased $1.4 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $0.6 billion. The company’s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $8 billion.OutlookThe 2023 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2023 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2023 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2023 projected comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported cost of goods sold, full-year 2023 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2023 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2023 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2023; the exact impact of changes in commodity costs throughout 2023; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2023; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2023. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company’s full-year 2023 reported financial results.Full Year 2023The company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 7% to 8%.For comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.The company expects commodity price inflation to be a mid single-digit percentage headwind on comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.The company’s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.5%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.Given the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 7% to 9% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.48 in 2022.Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a slight headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.The company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.5 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $1.9 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.First Quarter 2023 ConsiderationsComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include a 5% to 6% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 6% to 7% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.The first quarter has one less day compared to first quarter 2022.NotesAll references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. ""Unit case"" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. ""Unit case volume"" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.""Concentrate sales"" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, ""concentrate sales"" represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, ""concentrate sales"" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.""Price/mix"" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.First quarter 2022 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2021, and fourth quarter 2022 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2021. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.Conference CallThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2022 operating results today, Feb. 14, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change from baseline in Abscess and Inflammatory Nodule (AN) count at week 16. The key secondary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving HS Clinical Response at week 16. The study previously met its primary endpoint.The second part of the study, the open-label extension (OLE) period, spanned an additional 36 weeks (52 weeks total) and included patients enrolled in the first part of the study. All OLE patient participants (n=174) received treatment with povorcitinib 75 mg QD. Patients who completed baseline, week 16 and week 52 assessments could continue to receive open-label treatment with povorcitinib 75 mg QD for an additional 48 weeks after week 52.Results from the open-label extension period of the study demonstrated that longer-term treatment with povorcitinib 75 mg resulted in sustained and durable efficacy across all treatment arms. Povorcitinib also demonstrated durable efficacy at week 52 in high-threshold outcomes, as evidenced by 22-29% of patients achieving HS Clinical Response 100.Story continuesA phase III study in patients with moderate-to-severe HS is ongoing.Povorcitinib is also being evaluated for vitiligo and prurigo nodularis.Shares of Incyte have gained 20% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 8.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncyte recently reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter, driven by growth in patient demand for the lead drug, Jakafi, higher royalty revenues and encouraging uptake of other recently approved drugs.The successful development of other drugs will add an incremental stream of revenues to the top line and reduce the company’s dependence on Jakafi.Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Weyerhaeuser. See our latest analysis for Weyerhaeuser ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Weyerhaeuser?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Weyerhaeuser does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Weyerhaeuser's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Weyerhaeuser. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.8% and 5.5% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of WeyerhaeuserThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Weyerhaeuser Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$65m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Weyerhaeuser better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Weyerhaeuser (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

308,51e2c72d-b63e-33e0-8889-88aef1934729,WM,2023-02-14,"Should We Be Delighted With Waste Management, Inc.'s (NYSE:WM) ROE Of 33%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delighted-waste-management-inc-nyse-110055949.html,1676372455,STORY,['WM'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Waste Management How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:33% = US$2.2b ÷ US$6.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.33 in profit.Does Waste Management Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Waste Management has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesWaste Management's Debt And Its 33% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Waste Management, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.14. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Waste Management may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

309,bf8552de-faa1-3763-b683-fd59959db174,INTU,2023-02-14,‘Stay Long and Strong’: Billionaire Ken Fisher Snaps Up These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stay-long-strong-billionaire-ken-151412631.html,1676301252,STORY,"['INTU', 'VCYT']","[Ken FisherLast year’s bearish trend has turned on a dime into 2023’s bull run, and the question now is, what next? One prominent name to wade in on the matter is billionaire Ken Fisher. With a history of decades-long investing success, Fisher knows a thing or two about market behavior.The Fisher Investments founder famously started his independent money management firm with just $250 in 1979, a company that is now a $197-plus billion going concern, while Fisher’s own net worth stands north of $5 billion.Right now, where most prognosticators are seeing signs of recession building up for the coming year, Fisher sees a historical analogy to 1967. That year, coming off a bearish year, with high inflation, in a divisive political environment, with war on the geopolitical radar, everyone predicted a deep recession. What happened was the opposite. As Fisher describes it: “1967 is the year when inflation peaks and falls, interest rates plateau, we don’t get the recession because widely anticipated recessions are met by mitigation and anticipation. It's the most parallel period in modern history.”While interesting as theory, what’s more interesting to us is the practical example that Fisher is giving. He’s going ‘long and strong’ to the bullish side, and doubling down on some of his stock positions in preparation for continued strong market performances.We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to pull the details on two of his recent share purchases. Each is a Strong Buy, according to the analyst community, and has a solid upside potential for the coming year. Let's take a closer look.Veracyte, Inc. (VCYT)We’ll start in the world of biotech, where Veracyte is a leader in the vital field of diagnostics. The company offers a range of medical tests that provide the answers both physicians and patients need – the former to provide proper care, the latter to have the comfort of knowledge, and for both the information need to make decisions. The company’s tests use innovations in genomic technology and machine learning to provide the most accurate diagnoses – which in turn lead to better treatments and outcomes. Veracyte has tests available for a variety of diseases, particularly cancers, such as lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and breast cancer.Story continuesWe won’t see Veracyte’s most recent financial results – for 4Q22 – until later this month, but so far, the company’s trend looks good for investors. Revenues have been rising consistently for the past couple of years, with the 3Q22 top line of $75.6 million representing a 25% year-over-year increase. This was supported by 26% y/y growth in global test volume, which reached 26,374 tests completed. Veracyte bumped its full-year revenue forecast up to the range of $288 million to $293 million, an increase of 5.2% at the midline. We’ll know on February 22 if the company has achieved that goal.In the meantime, Ken Fisher is clearly upbeat about Veracyte. He already had a position in this stock, and in the last quarter increased it by 21%, or buying 348,096 shares. This brings Fisher’s total holding in VCYT to 2,085,604 shares, or almost 3% of the company. His shares are worth about $51 million at current valuations.Veracyte’s array of cancer screening tests puts the company in a solid position, and has also caught the eye of Scotiabank analyst Sung Ji Nam, who writes: “VCYT is a pioneer in the Advanced Dx space, particularly with its thyroid cancer test… in March 2021, VCYT became the leader in the prostate cancer prognostic and therapy selection test market, and we expect Decipher’s prostate cancer test to be the key driver of VCYT’s double-digit top-line growth over the next few years. VCYT is also in the process of developing a non-invasive test for lung cancer which could represent the largest market opportunity for VCYT going forward (we estimate multi-billion dollars).""""Given its commercial track record, multiple growth drivers ahead, and operating efficiency compared with peers, we believe VCYT is well positioned to maintain its double-digit revenue growth in the near term and to potentially further accelerate its growth longer term,” the analyst summed up.Looking ahead, to quantify her bullish stance, Nam gives VCYT stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and her price target of $33 implies a potential upside of ~35% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Sung’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 4 recent analyst reviews on VCYT, they include 3 to Buy against just 1 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $24.47 and the $33.33 average price target indicates room for 36% upside in the year ahead. (See VCYT stock forecast)Intuit, Inc. (INTU)The second Fisher pick we're looking at is a software company. Intuit is the maker of the popular family of TurboTax and Quickbooks products, which facilitate bookkeeping, accounting, and tax calculations for individuals and small businesses. The company sees a regular peak in revenues coinciding with the calendar year second quarter – that includes the April deadline for individuals’ annual IRS tax returns.That deadline is just two months away, and Intuit is gearing up for its regular busy season. In the meantime, we can look back at the firm’s last reported quarter – Q1 of fiscal ’23, the quarter ending on October 31 – and get an idea of where it stands now.There have been some fits and starts, but overall, Intuit has seen steady top-line growth since the pandemic period. In fiscal 1Q23, the company’s revenue of $2.6 billion was up 29% from the prior-year result; this figure included a 13-point add from the acquisition of Mailchimp in fiscal 1Q22. In calendar year 2022, the company saw over $12 billion in total revenue. On the bottom line, Intuit’s non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.66 per share for Q2. This beat the $1.19 forecast by 39%, and was up 8.4% year-over-year.We’ll see Intuit’s fiscal Q2 results on February 23. The company typically posts its highest quarterly revenue in fiscal Q3, reported in late spring; that report will include revenue results from the annual tax season.Ken Fisher, however, is not waiting for these later reports – he’s expanding his holding in INTU now, and last quarter bought 462,468 shares. This marked an increase of 24% in his stake in the company, which now reaches 2,412,769 share and is valued at an impressive $1 billion.Echoing Fisher's activity, Mizuho analyst Siti Panigrahi is a big INTU fan and sees plenty to remain upbeat about.“Intuit remains a defensive software name with strong cash flows and consistent shareholder returns... We expect Intuit to deliver a strong FQ2 given that current consensus expectations appear conservative across multiple segments. For Small Business, we expect upside driven by FY23 price increases and continued momentum in online services with tailwinds from employment and growing attach rate of payments. For Tax, FQ2 consensus implies a slow start trend in January similar to last year, while we believe IRS filings will return to pre-COVID trends,” Panigrahi opined.Putting a number to his outlook, Panigrahi gives INTU shares a $650 price target, to suggest ~56% one-year upside that fully backs his Buy rating. (To watch Panigrahi’s track record, click here)Overall, Intuit boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 positive analyst reviews – enough to overwhelm the lone ‘Sell’ rating. The shares have a trading price of $417.50 and their average price target of $492.33 implies ~18% gain in the next 12 months.

For the fourth quarter, we expect the segment’s revenues to increase 3.2% year over year.For the Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment, strong momentum in the air dimensions business is expected to have been beneficial in the fourth quarter. The consensus mark for fourth-quarter Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment revenues suggests a 9.7% increase from the year-ago reported number. For the quarter, we expect the Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment revenues to climb 8.9% year over year.The acquisition of Dosatron International in October 2022 is expected to have boosted Ingersoll Rand’s top line in the fourth quarter.However, IR’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have been hampered by increasing costs of sales, rising selling and administrative expenses and supply-chain disruptions.

Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”13.

Recently, CINF's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish price movement.CINF has rallied 15.1% over the past four weeks, and the company is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank at the moment.

""Notwithstanding that, still we are making out attempts to push through our product.""HAL is also in talks with the Philippines to sell its light-combat helicopters, he added.""There is a lot of interest generated in the global aerospace market. Sooner or later we will have a breakthrough order,"" he said.HAL is targeting export sales of 25 billion Indian rupees ($302.15 million) over the next few years, its director of operations Jayadeva EP told Reuters.India has been one of the world's biggest importers of defence equipment for decades, but it has punched below its weight in the global arms export market.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday set out ambitions to more than triple the value of annual defence exports to $5 billion over the next two years and his government has been making diplomatic efforts to export the Tejas.The Indian government in 2021 gave a $6 billion contract to HAL for 83 of the locally produced Tejas jets for delivery starting around 2023 - four decades after the design began in 1983.The Tejas has been beset by design and other challenges, and was once rejected by the Indian Navy as too heavy.HAL plans to use the General Electric manufactured 414 engine on a second generation of light-combat aircraft, Ananthakrishnan said, adding it was in talks to produce those engines in India.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Electric (GE).GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.72, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.72 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.3% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying GE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in GE?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 49.7% over the past month to $1.93.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, it is pursuing a strategy to help to diversify clinical trials.All the major health care companies are in some way pursuing what is known as ""vertical integration,"" or combining their business with other segments of the health industry.Take for example the biggest commercial insurer, United Healthcare (UNH). It has the Optum brand, a pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare provider used in physician's offices, and OptumRx which helps United compete in the pharmacy benefits space.Experts have ongoing worries about the impact of these behemoth companies, especially the quality of care received by patients.But there may not be enough data yet to determine if the benefits — ideally lower costs and better patient adherence to care plans — outweigh the risks of more centralized industry control.A logo outside an Oak Street Health urgent care center is pictured after CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) announced it will buy Oak Street Health Inc (OSH.N) for about $9.5 billion in cash, in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., February 8, 2023. REUTERS/Mike SegarIn a separate, recent report from the New England Journal of Medicine's Catalyst group, CVS chief medical officer Dr. David Fairchild said the pandemic showed patients' affinity for convenience in health care.""I think the health care industry still needs to focus on how to make health care more convenient and accessible because this is what people want and need,"" Fairchild said.Oak Street Health, whose patients are older adults, is focused on a type of payment model that has been long-discussed but which has never taken off in a big way: value-based care.This, according to health economist Craig Garthwaite, is key.""If people have always said the problem with U.S. health care is the fee-for-service system where we don't really have a system to buy health, we have a system to buy health care services and everyone in this system makes money when you consumer more care...this takes away that incentive,"" said Garthwaite, director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.Story continues""They make money, now that they are owned by an insurance company ... when you use less health care,"" Garthwaite explained.But despite being owned by an insurer, the company says it will remain agnostic toward insurers that reimburse it for services.CVS sees growth opportunity in Oak Street, which has already been able to scale to 169 clinics and is expected to reach 300 by 2026. CVS benefits from the transaction as it can contribute to Oak Street patient growth through its channels, as well as driving greater utilization of CVS pharmacy and Caremark, according to CFO Shawn Guertin during a recent earnings call.""There's obviously things we can do for plan design offerings to highlight the Oak network or the Oak clinics. We can do that with the Aetna members. I mentioned Signify before as a potential sort of source of members, but when you just think about the vast array of members that we interact with and the vast array of seniors that we interact with every year, across this company, this is a much wider catch basin if you will for potential growth,"" Guertin said.Analysts have hailed the move, even while criticizing the price tag.David Larsen, an analyst at BTIG, said in a note that this new primary care business, along with its recent acquisition of Signify, makes CVS ""one of the most dominant forces in health care services.""Larsen noted that while the transaction has been talked about for a while — CVS said it had been doing due diligence for 15 months prior — he was ""somewhat surprised at the pace with which the market is moving"" with regard to primary care acquisitions.Cigna (CI) and Walgreens (WBA) recently invested in VillageMD, and Walgreens is acquiring Summit Health for $8.9 billion, while Amazon (AMZN) acquired One Medical (ONEM).Scott Dunn, lead healthcare analyst at CB Insights said major health-care brands like CVS are no longer simply insurers or drug store chains.""These moves demonstrate the continued push by many high-profile pharmacies into fast-growing healthcare markets such as senior care, primary care, and home health,"" Dunn said in a recent note.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

This compares to FFO of $0.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 7.46%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.74 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.81, delivering a surprise of 9.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Vornado , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $446.94 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $421.08 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Vornado shares have added about 11.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.5%.What's Next for Vornado?While Vornado has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Vornado: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.65 on $450.63 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.69 on $1.81 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

If you want to see more ETFs in this selection, check out Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs to Buy. Many experts believe 2023 will witness even more fluctuations in the markets than last year, with the presence of factors such as high inflation levels, job cuts by technology companies, increasing interest rates, and international uncertainties. As a result, investors will be seeking methods to minimize risk and broaden their investment portfolios. Christopher Huemmer, senior investment strategist at FlexShares ETFs, told Fox Business on February 6: “The biggest driver investors need to prepare for in the upcoming year is volatility. We have seen an increase in the number of volatility spikes across both equity and fixed-income markets.”As per Huemmer, ETFs as an investment vehicle do not guarantee the reduction of portfolio risk by themselves. However, the advancements in the design of ETFs and the indexes they track offer the potential for investors to manage their risk. He highlighted that one such approach could be a focus on quality, low-risk stocks which can be easily incorporated into an investor's equity allocation. This strategy aims to provide some protection against losses while still allowing the investor to remain invested in the equity markets.Morgan Stanley, which played a crucial role in the establishment of the ETF industry, is making its return to the segment after 30 years. This could mark a significant moment for the investment community. Morgan Stanley's return to the ETF industry could have a major impact on the $6.9 trillion US ETF market. Previously, there were only a small number of major financial institutions without a presence in the industry, including Capital Group and Dimensional Fund Advisors. However, Morgan Stanley stands out with its control of approximately $5.5 trillion of assets through its wealth and investment management divisions, including billions invested in ETFs. The possibility that some of these assets could be redirected to its own ETFs increases the likelihood of Morgan Stanley quickly becoming a disruptive force in the industry. Anthony Rochte, Morgan Stanley’s global head of ETFs, told Bloomberg on February 1: Story continues“This is the first step in a series of launches. While we’re focusing on the US, we’re certainly working on a parallel launch in Europe down the road.”Some of the stocks that diversified ETFs offer exposure to include Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML). Our Methodology We selected the consensus picks of credible websites like Forbes, CNBC, and Bloomberg, selecting the most popular US sector ETFs, micro-cap ETFs, and international/foreign ETFs for this list. Diversified Stock Portfolio: Sector ETFs and International ETFs to BuyPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashDiversified Stock Portfolio: Sector ETFs and International ETFs to Buy15.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”14.

Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 17.85 million shares worth $750.5 million. Here is what First Eagle Investments Global Fund has to say about Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.It also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance. We remain constructive on the stock, which offers steady production anchored in good jurisdictions, a good pipeline of organic projects, a strong balance sheet, and proven management.”13. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB)iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB) seeks to track the investment results of Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index, which is composed of U.S. equities in the home construction sector.

(NYSE:DHI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“The shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), the number one homebuilder by volume in the U.S., gained 31% in the most recent quarter following strong business results.We are bullish about the long-term prospects for D.R. Horton primarily due to two key considerations: 1) We believe the company is positioned to perform well over time given its status as the largest and lowest-cost producer in the entrylevel home segment for first-time buyers and baby boomers looking for an affordable home. In the last fiscal year, approximately 67% of D.R. Horton’s home sales were for prices less than $400,000, thereby enabling the company to satisfy the home affordability constraints of many potential home buyers.2) We are enthusiastic about D.R. Horton’s continued transition to a stronger and more asset-light balance sheet by outsourcing its land development spending needs to third-party developers such as Forestar Group Inc. D.R. Horton’s transition to a less capital-intensive business model is leading to stronger cash-flow generation, lower debt levels, an ability to pursue more share repurchases and/or other investment opportunities, and a higher-valuation multiple.”12.

We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.”11.

Nestlé continues to enjoy competitive advantages related to its scale, distribution, and brand equity. We think the management team has positioned the business for success in recent years, with several divestitures along the way and believe the company is still likely to deliver consistent results. That said, our research indicates that returns may be at the lower end of our expected range and other opportunities appear more attractive.”9.

(NYSE:PLD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Following strong quarterly results, the shares of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, performed well in the fourth quarter of 2022. The company owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is concentrated in major global trade markets and large population centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Prologis has an unmatched global platform, strong competitive advantages (scale, data, and technology), and attractive embedded growth prospects. The company is the only industrial REIT with an ‘A’ credit rating.Following a roughly 33% decline in its shares in 2022, we believe Prologis’ current valuation of only 22 times cash flow and a 4.6% implied capitalization rate is compelling given that the company’s rents on its in-place leases are more than 65% below current market rents, thus providing a strong runway for growth in the next three to five years.”8. iShares International Select Dividend ETF (BATS:IDV)iShares International Select Dividend ETF (BATS:IDV) seeks to track the investment results of Dow Jones EPAC Select Dividend Index, which is composed of relatively high dividend paying equities in non-U.S. developed markets.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries.

Rising borrowing costs and labor market pessimism are likely to weigh down on consumers’ willingness to spend. Also, higher e-commerce adoption might continue to affect retail landlords’ cash flows.Nevertheless, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime amid limited new supply is likely to help industry fundamentals. Efforts to support omni-channel retailing, adaptive reuse capabilities and opportunities emanating from consolidations, and focus on e-commerce resistant sectors have poised Simon Property Group, Inc. SPG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and National Retail Properties, Inc. NNN well for growth.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry embodies a group of REITs engaged in owning, developing, managing and renting space in a variety of retail real estates. Among these are regional malls, outlet centers, grocery-anchored shopping centers and power centers, including big-box retailers. Also, net lease REITs enjoy the ownership of freestanding properties, wherein both rent and the majority of operating expenses for the properties are borne by tenants. The overall health of the economy, job market and consumer spending are the main drivers of retail REITs, while property locations and trade area demographics play key roles in demand determination. Dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies bothered this asset category in the past. However, shoppers’ renewed enthusiasm for in-person shopping has helped the industry tide over.What's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry?Inflationary Pressure, Rate Hike, Economic Slowdown to Make It Challenging: The retail real estate market is likely to remain challenging in the near term, given the inflationary pressure, higher interest rates and economic slowdown. Particularly, though inflation is moderating, it is still a concern as it is leading to the adoption of a more cautious spending attitude by consumers. Also, a slowdown in the job market and any potential impact on wage growth is likely to aggravate the woes, making shoppers more dependent on their savings and credit for purchases. Amid the uncertainty in the economic backdrop, the depletion of savings, the rising borrowing costs and the labor market pessimism, demand for retailers’ goods is likely to dwindle. This, in turn, would temper the demand for the retail real estate space in the near term. Moreover, with a shortage of labors, staffing of stores is likely to become challenging for retailers. Higher material and operating costs may remain as retailers’ woes. These issues, in turn, are expected to moderate the demand for retail space as well as cast a pall on landlords’ cash flows.Moreover, the dependence of REITs on debt for business is more compared to the other industries, making investors skeptical about their performance in a rising rate environment. Also, as the investment world treats REITs as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature, these companies are susceptible to rising rates.Higher E-commerce Adoption to Remain a Concern: Consumers’ habits have transformed at a rapid pace over the past years and traffic at retail real estates has suffered, with e-commerce capturing market share from brick-and-mortar stores. With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. Yet, given the convenience it offers, online shopping is likely to remain a popular choice among customers. This might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Omni-Channel Strategy, Structural Changes in Focus: Omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. In fact, consumers these days prefer to research products online but buy or pick up in stores. Amid this, click-and-collect sales are likely to gain momentum.Moreover, digitally-native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy since the opening of stores helps them to improve their connection with customers and drive expansion. Therefore, for retailers, the focus now is not only on increasing their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations.Renewed Enthusiasm for In-Store Shopping Experience Amid Limited Supply to Aid Fundamentals: This industry is poised to benefit from the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers as they look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime. However, comparing to the pre-pandemic levels, the construction of new retail space remains dreary amid high construction costs. Also, with struggling malls and centers’ landlords opting for mixed-use developments over the past years, a sizeable part of retail space has been removed from the market. This limited supply is likely to support the retail real estate industry fundamentals even amidst the challenging economic backdrop and its corresponding impact on retail demand.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

Historical returns of dividend stocks have also shown that they have lower price volatility compared to non-dividend stocks.Continuous changes in monetary policies in 2022 altered investor sentiment and brought dividend securities into the limelight. Though S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% last year, dividend companies remained on strong footing, rewarding investors with stable returns. According to a report by ProShares, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index fell by just 6.21% in 2022 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index reported a 0.11% drop, versus a harsher decline of the wider market. Similarly, Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index. These numbers show that dividend growth strategies outperformed the broader market in large-, small-, and mid-cap spaces in the US. Some companies that have consistently raised their dividends include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX).Another report by Allspring Global Investments also highlighted the positive performance of dividend stocks over time.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”13.

With much of the major reporting all behind us, there are still some big names to come, and this week, we turn to Coca-Cola, which is due to report earnings on Tuesday, 14th of February.The major soft drink company based in Atlanta, whose brands include Dasani, Fanta, and its namesake drink, has been increasing product prices to combat inflation, but as a result, customers have been trading down to smaller package sizes or rivals that sell cheaper knockoffs. Are Coca-Cola shares a buy, and will the company manage to beat expectations on its latest earnings? We’ll take a look and see what’s in store for Q4, full-year earnings, and the year to come.PepsiCo’s Latest Earnings Beat ExpectationsFor Coca-Cola’s main rival PepsiCo, revenue and profits for the quarter announced last week were above Wall Street estimates, thanks in large part to the company charging higher prices for its food and beverage products.Although PepsiCo and Coca-Cola make similar soft drinks and are direct competitors in most areas, they are slightly different in the way they conduct business. PepsiCo also markets a wide variety of convenience style and packaged foods which are generally at an attractive price point during difficult economic conditions, so this will have impacted earnings for the upside.Organic volume fell 2%, but to combat rising freight and material expenses as well as the negative effects of a stronger dollar on overseas sales, average product prices increased by 16%.The company anticipates 6% organic sales growth and an 8% increase in core constant currency EPS in 2023. While also intending to buy back over $1.0 billion in shares. In addition, PepsiCo announced its 51st consecutive annual increase to its dividend, a 10% bump, effective with its June 2023 payment.Source: ActivTrades’ online trading platformLooking Back at Coca-Cola Q3Even though there had been substantial effects brought on by the pace of inflation as well as the strength of the United States dollar, Coca-Cola’s Q3 was a positive one.Story continues Profits per share of $0.69 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.64. Additionally, revenue came in slightly higher than anticipated at $11.05 billion, compared to the $10.52 billion previously reported.At the time, the company raised its outlook for adjusted EPS and organic revenue growth. While cautioning against the effects of rising prices and volatility for 2023. They said they expected adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 7% in 2022, up from 5% to 6% previously. While organic sales growth was forecast to jump from 12% to 13% to 14% to 15%.Q4 ExpectationAccording to Financial Researcher Zacks, quarterly profits for Coca-Cola are expected to be $0.45 per share, around the same as in Q4 2021. It’s anticipated that quarterly sales of $10.01 billion will be posted, which is an increase of 6% over the prior-year period.This would bring Coca-profits Cola’s for Fiscal 2022 to $2.48 per share, an increase of 7% from where they were before. Sales are projected to increase by 11% in the fiscal year 2022, reaching $42.86 billion from $38.66 billion in the 2021 fiscal year.Can the Company Successfully Continue to Weather the Economic Storm?Q3 results and Q4 earnings show the resiliency of packaged food manufacturers, particularly in the United States, as consumers prioritize spending on dining at home over eating out.Coca-Cola is fortunately aided by widespread product availability and strong brand awareness. Additionally, its plan to roll out smaller bottles and multipacks amid a time of less discretionary spending ought to assist top-line growth in the next quarter.Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey highlighted back in October last year that the corporation will increase prices further in regions where expenses were rising, to pass the majority of them on to customers before a possible recession. He also suggested that the company was prepared for a downturn by investing in smaller and less expensive packaging, but that in any case, Coca-Cola’s products have traditionally been among the last to notice a decrease in demand during recessions.Source: ActivTrades’ online trading platformCFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 85% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

345,b994e1ce-9383-37fc-94d3-9ae22cf9a7b3,AMP,2023-02-14,Scoop Up These 4 GARP Stocks to Get Handsome Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scoop-4-garp-stocks-handsome-131601330.html,1676294161,STORY,"['GWW', 'CDW', 'AMP', 'EWBC']","[If you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing. Ameriprise Financial AMP, W.W. Grainger GWW, CDW Corporation CDW and East West Bancorp EWBC are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsBoth a strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that both growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.Using the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Story continuesScreening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS &amp; projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE than the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four of the six stocks that made it through the screening process:Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company that offers a wide range of products and services focused on financial planning and advice. The company helps its individual and institutional clients achieve their financial objectives. AMP currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.Ameriprise Financial has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.5% on average.

348,d22d9ed4-b5ba-3bce-97f0-1488312728b3,CSCO,2023-02-14,picoCTF: How Gamified Cybersecurity Piques Curiosity in STEM,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/picoctf-gamified-cybersecurity-piques-curiosity-143000449.html,1676298600,STORY,['CSCO'],"[The Transformational Tech series highlights Cisco's nonprofit grant recipients that use technology to help transform the lives of individuals and communities.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 13, 2023 / Around the world, the need for information security skilled workers is growing. In the U.S. the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates a 35 percent increase of IT skilled employment by 2031. This area of expertise is growing faster than the average of all occupations. In the European Union, Parliament is working to build cybersecurity capabilities across the Union to mitigate threats and ensure the continuity of services. In these contexts, students who are studying computer science and cybersecurity will play pivotal roles in society. As such, it's critical to encourage the next generation of information security experts and ethical hackers.To bring down the barriers to access computer science and cybersecurity education to students, particularly by girls and women, intervention is needed at earlier grade levels and supported by trained teachers in school classrooms.Since 2011, picoCTF has steadily broken down the barriers to access cybersecurity education to become one of the most trusted, high-quality, free resources for computer security education for learners and teachers across the globe. Originally intended as a uniquely offensive capture the flag style online competition, picoCTF made an impression right from the start. And with some well-timed grant support from Cisco starting in 2019, they have expanded to year-round, easy and accessible access to their program for anyone with a computer and Wi-Fi.Making space and bypassing barriersPrior to programs like picoCTF, the only way young people could interact with computer materials were through established high school computer security competitions.Created by Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) Cylab Security and Privacy Institute (Cylab), picoCTF initially focused its efforts on generating interest in computer science among highschoolers. Its name is filled with meaning; with ‘pico' being a unit that represents one trillionth in the metric scale, and ‘CTF' short for capture the flag. During their annual fall competition, picoCTF contestants would explore valuable life and career skills through a free online, ethical hacking-based game with a capture the flag framework. Within this game, players are challenged to test their creativity, technical skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges cover a number of categories. And when solved, the winner gains a string (called a flag) that is then submitted for online scoring.Story continuesBecause picoCTF platform access is free, significantly more students could access and engage with the program. For instance, results from picoCTF's 2019 competition reported that 64 percent of players said they were ""more interested in pursuing cybersecurity as a career as a result of playing [the game]."" And with this positive feedback, the people behind picoCTF knew they had what it takes to engage students.A place to stretch and workoutIn 2019, Cylab's leaders, like Special Projects Manager, Megan Kearns, determined that the program needed further engagement with teachers and classrooms throughout the world but didn't have the money or the resources to reach that goal. The team proposed a concept for Cisco investment in picoCTF to build teacher centric and classroom changes into their platform.In addition to teacher and classroom improvements, picoCTF as a team focused on offering more structured learning materials for middle and lower secondary students and high school students. Within a year, picoCTF launched picoGYM, an always-open learning playground where learners can access all previous years' picoCTF challenges, along with treasure hunts, quizzes, and more.With the launch of picoGYM came a fully-accessible, year-round learning platform-rather than a three month competition-focused website. ""picoCTF began as just a competition to introduce students."" Megan said that picoCTF ""has now evolved into this year-round program for people to apply what they're learning in their classes and test out concepts they faced in the workplace but never got to address themselves.""picoGYM launched in September 2020. By December, Cylab had measured over 65,000 visitors to the account-based site.Encouraging girls to pursue cybersecurityWith an offering accessible to teachers in classrooms, Cisco's second investment centered on increasing female participation in cybersecurity education. ""Part of our initiative [with Cisco] includes female testers in our outreach,"" explained Dr. Hanan Hibshi, faculty advisor at CMU and research investigator for picoCTF. ""So when we invite people to test our challenges, we pay special attention to female responses.""Dr. Hibshi clarified that by paying attention to female feedback, particularly with details related to the game's organization and interface-they've found success. This success is measured by the increase in female users over time, which is proof of focused engagement. In 2021, the website measured only 1900 learners who identified as female. And in 2022, that number leaped to over 10,000 girls and young women who accessed the picoCTF website. Megan recounted that the ""picoCTF development team has seen an increase in female challenge writers, which have made an impact on the increase in female players."" She believes it is connected to their outreach efforts because female CMU students and experienced CTF players go to conferences and classrooms to talk to students about picoCTF and how to engage in CTF competitions.With picoCTF's more comprehensive and complementary learning structure, new platform, and year-round access to picoGYM, learners of all skill levels can access cybersecurity content, think creatively, problem solve challenges, and have fun while learning cybersecurity concepts. At Cisco we are curious and delighted to see more female students enrolling and getting excited about cybersecurity.""The grants from Cisco have made a significant positive impact. It has allowed us the funding to focus on areas of improvements in the platform, facilitate user studies, go to conferences, and expand our understanding of what CTFs are, what they are capable of doing in the education space."" Megan clarified, ""this is an area where diversity has the potential to make a huge difference in how we move forward in cybersecurity. Diversity is so important because creativity is so important to cybersecurity.""The future is brightMegan Kearns reports that, over the years, people have approached her countless times to tell her they've switched careers after they played picoCTF. Her favorite story like this involves a high school teacher who mentored his students through their picoCTF competition, which then led to ten years of his dedicated work as team coach in many other computer security competitions. One Twitter user, @Dawnlight246810 told Megan, ""When I got into cybersecurity, picoCTF was my first-ever CTF I played. I learned so much from playing pico that I fell in love with security, got involved with infosec communities, and decided to pursue a career in security.""""Of course our immediate goal is to increase the cybersecurity workforce."" Dr. Hanan added, ""but my long-term vision is that it becomes so everyone knows enough to stay safe online, enough not to be scammed, or to spend time to secure your passwords. Because you cracked systems before, you broke passwords through picoCTF, and you know that this is feasible and hackers can do it. So maybe you should do a better job of protecting yourself.""Megan hopes for another ten years of success for picoCTF. ""Eventually, I would like for us to be redundant because everyone already understands cybersecurity,"" she continues, ""the way they understand algebra or mathematics.""View original content here.Cisco Systems Inc., Monday, February 13, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/739093/picoCTF-How-Gamified-Cybersecurity-Piques-Curiosity-in-STEM]"
