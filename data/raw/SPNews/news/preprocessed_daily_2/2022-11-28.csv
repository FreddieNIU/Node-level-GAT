For more companies,Â  head on over to 5 Biggest Holding Companies in the World. A holding company is quite common in the business world, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance. They are created due to the fact that holding companies and their subsidiaries are separate entities. So if the subsidiary encounters any problems, or goes bankrupt for instance, the parent will be shielded from the subsequent liability requirements.In the financial world, there are different kinds of firms that are involved in the business of investing in other companies. Apart from holding companies, hedge funds and mutual funds also acquire an interest in firms. However, the primary difference between these and a holding company is that the former two do not acquire a controlling stake that provides them with the ability to set management and decide on the long term strategic objectives of the target firm. However, a holding company generally does acquire a controlling stake, and due to this, it is also entitled to the profits of a subsidiary. The percentage of the share in profits depends on the controlling stake and is listed after the subsidiary has accounted for all business expenses, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax payments.Holding companies also offer tax advantages, if the parent company is headquartered in a low tax rate region. Additionally, the subsidiaries can either be acquired through purchasing shares or if a larger entity decides to spin off a business unit.There are some limitations to a holding company though. For instance, a holding company cannot acquire a stake in either an S Corp or a sole proprietorship. S companies are exempt from paying taxes, and instead, their profits are routed back to the owners who then pay income taxes. Additionally, while the picture might be rosy for the parent, it comes with a myriad of risks for the subsidiary. The subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Finally, multinationals often face difficulties in transferring their profits across countries due to a lack of standardized tax rules that leads to double taxation on the profits depending on the route that the profits take from the subsidiaries to the parent.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take a look at some of the biggest holding companies in the world. Most of these are banks, but there are others as well. Renowned names include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Timothy Welsh, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$44.26. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 26% of Timothy Welsh's stake.In the last year U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.U.S. Bancorp Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$110m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold U.S. Bancorp shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Walmart.Is There Enough Growth For Walmart?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Walmart's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 14%. However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen an unpleasant 34% overall drop in EPS. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 33% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Walmart's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Walmart's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Walmart maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Plus, you should also learn about these   2 warning signs we've spotted with Walmart.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

However, there are extra steps you should take to ensure you're actually getting a good deal when you shop and aren't missing out on any special perks that these big-box stores offer.Costco's Best Deals? Employee Reveals 10 Standout Buys for Your MoneySee: 3 Signs You're Serious About Raising Your Credit ScoreBefore your next shopping trip, make sure you aren't making any of these costly mistakes.shaunl / Getty ImagesMistakes To Avoid When Shopping at CostcoCostco is a bulk-buyer's paradise -- but not everything there is a good deal. Don't make these mistakes when you shop at the warehouse store.Photo Spirit / Shutterstock.comNot Making a List Ahead of TimeYou're sure to overspend when you go to Costco without a plan for what to buy.""Whether you're going into Costco for the first time or your 100th time, the vast warehouse of products can seem exciting and possibly, a little overwhelming. But like any shopping trip, making a list ahead of time is crucial, especially since Costco is mapped out to entice shoppers to buy more -- things they likely don't need -- by placing and rotating items in different spots,"" said Rebecca Gramuglia, retail expert at TopCashback.com. ""Avoid impulse buys and plan ahead, and your wallet will thank you.""Take Our Poll: How Much Salary Would Buy You Happiness?David Tonelson / Shutterstock.comBuying Everything in BulkYou might equate bulk buying with getting a good deal, but this isn't necessarily the case.""Buying in bulk can be a great deal if you will use or consume the items purchased, but it can also make a dent in your wallet and/or trash can if you don't use them,"" Gramuglia said. ""Before you buy, it's important to analyze the cost per unit to see if it is worth buying the larger option.""David Tonelson / Shutterstock.comBuying Something You Don't Know You Like""If you see an item that you want to try but it's in bulk, hold off on purchasing it,"" Gramuglia said. ""You're better off buying a single unit at your regular grocery store to see if you actually like the product before overspending on a larger quantity of something you may end up tossing in the garbage.""Story continuesdennizn / Shutterstock.comPaying Full Price for MembershipYou can save on your membership by purchasing it through a cash-back site.""Knock a few extra dollars off of your choice of membership by shopping through TopCashback.com,"" Gramuglia said. ""You can score $3 cash back on a Gold Star Membership purchase and $6 cash back on the Executive Membership purchase.""ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.comNot Upgrading Your MembershipGold Star Executive membership costs $120 a year while Gold Star membership costs $60 a year, but you might be able to recoup the cost -- and then some -- with the executive membership's 2% cash back annual reward. If you spend more than $250 a month at Costco, your rewards check for the year will be more than $60, so you'll make up the price difference and then some.Jarrett Homan / Shutterstock.comNot Taking Advantage of Price AdjustmentsIf an item you bought goes on sale within 30 days of your purchase, you can get the difference back as a price adjustment. Not taking advantage of this policy is basically throwing money away.melissamn / Shutterstock.comNot Stocking Up on Gift Cards -- for YourselfCostco sells gift cards at a discount, so it's worth it to purchase them for yourself for restaurants and retailers that you frequent. You're automatically saving when you shop or dine with the discounted gift card.Helen89 / Shutterstock.comNot Taking Advantage of the Costco Concierge ServiceYou already know that Costco has some of the lowest prices on electronics, but you might not know that your tech purchases give you free access to the superstore's Concierge Service. Costco offers free technical support for members, as well as a two-year warranty on many electronics purchases.calimedia / Shutterstock.comBuying Only Brand-Name ItemsDon't overlook Kirkland Signature items. For many products, Costco's store brand is comparable to its name-brand counterpart.GOBankingRatesNot Paying Attention to Price SignsYou may not realize it, but there's a lot of information about a product hidden in its price sign. Uproxx reports that the following prices and symbols have specific meanings:Prices ending in .99 or .98: These products are retail price, and don't provide savings over other store's prices unless bought in bulk.Prices ending inÂ .89, .79, .69, .59, .49, .39, .29, .19 or .09: These are manufacturer deals, so you're getting a lower price than you would elsewhere.Prices ending in .97: These are items that are on sale because the store manager needs to move stock.Prices ending inÂ .88 or .00: This indicates a steeply discounted product.Asterisk: Price signs marked with an asterisk in the top right corner indicate that it's heavily discounted and will be discontinued, so now is the time to stock up.Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAvoiding Costco If You're Not a MemberThere are some Costo perks even nonmembers can take advantage of. This includes filling prescriptions at the pharmacy, which often has lower prices for drugs than elsewhere, CNBC reported. Nonmembers can also get flu shots and eye exams at Costco, purchase food at the food court and -- in certain states -- buy alcohol at Costco's low prices.Hadrian / Shutterstock.comMistakes To Avoid When Shopping on AmazonIf there's something you want or need, there's a good chance you can find it on Amazon. However, you might be paying too much for your purchases if you're making any of these online shopping errors.nortonrsx / Getty Images/iStockphotoNot Knowing When the Popular Sale Seasons Are""It's really easy to see something you like and purchase it on the spot -- especially when Amazon makes checking out very convenient -- but what if you knew it went on sale less than a month later?"" Gramuglia said. ""Seasonal items usually get marked down around the same time every year and sale events like Amazon's Prime Day have similar items discounted every year. Typically, on Prime Day, you can expect prices to be at their lowest amount, even beating Black Friday on popular items from beauty, tech, home, kitchen and virtually every other category you can think of.""Gramuglia notes that although Prime Day traditionally takes place during the first few weeks of July, there are reports that it may be moved to September this year.PixieMe / Shutterstock.comNot Subscribing for Household Items You Buy RegularlyYou're missing out on a substantial discount on items you buy often if you don't use this feature.""With Amazon's Subscribe &amp; Save, you can save time and money on everyday items,"" Gramulgia said. ""From detergent to toilet paper, you can subscribe to receive shipments of the items you need on a regular basis for less. And for every five or more products in one auto-delivery, you can get as much as 15% or 20% off if you're a Prime member on subscriptions to diapers, baby food and more.""Julie Clopper / Shutterstock.comNot Opting for Free No-Rush Shipping""If you're an Amazon Prime member and don't need your order right away, consider choosing free no-rush shipping instead of free two-day shipping to earn rewards on future Amazon purchases,"" Gramulgia said. ""This is a great way to save money in the long run.""martin-dm / Getty Images/iStockphotoNot Using an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card""The Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card or Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is a must-have for any Amazon shopper,"" Gramuglia said. ""For every eligible purchase you make with an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card, you earn 3% back -- or 5% back if you're a Prime member with the Prime Rewards card -- at Amazon.com and Whole Foods; 2% back at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores; and 1% back everywhere else.""Twin Design / Shutterstock.comSkipping 'Today's Deals'You can find Amazon's best deals and steals for new products in the ""Today's Deals"" link at the top of any Amazon page.""There you'll be able to shop Amazon's Deal of the Day and Lightning Deals -- the latter is when you only get hours or just minutes to purchase a product on sale,"" Gramuglia said. ""This added browsing can score you more savings than you expect at Amazon.""katleho Seisa / Getty ImagesAssuming Amazon Is a One-Stop ShopAlthough it may be convenient to buy everything on Amazon, it doesn't always have the best prices.""There are plenty of other online retailers that can give you a better price and discount,"" Gramuglia said. ""Before you check out, browse other major online retailers and compare prices to ensure you're really getting the best deal.""BrandonKleinVideo / Shutterstock.comSetting Up the One-Click Payment Option""Yes, it makes things so much easier to buy an item with just one click, but it also makes it much easier to overspend,"" said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. ""Ignore the impulse to make shopping too easy, and leave the one-click settings turned off. If you have to go through the entire process of adding the item to your cart, and choosing shipping, address and payment options, you'll be less likely to buy something you don't need.""hobo_018 / Getty ImagesNot Comparing Prices for the Same Item in Different ColorsAmazon will sometimes have different prices for the same item in different colors based on the supply and demand for each color, CNBC reported. If the color doesn't matter to you, click through the different options to find the lowest price.mama_mia / Shutterstock.comIgnoring Prices From Other SellersWhen you search for an item on Amazon, you don't always see the best price for it on the main product page. On the right column of the product page, you will see a list of ""other sellers on Amazon"" and the prices they are selling the item for. In some cases, there are lower prices available.LaylaBird / Getty ImagesNot Checking the Coupon BoxApplying coupons on Amazon is as easy as checking a box underneath where the item price is listed -- but if you don't look out for it, you could miss it and miss out on the savings.bernardbodo / Getty Images/iStockphotoNot Tracking PricesPrices on Amazon fluctuate often, so it's worth checking a price tracking site like CamelCamelCamel.com to see if the current price for an item you want is high or low. If you're not in a rush to buy it, you can set an alert that will let you know when the price has dropped.Devin Powers / Shutterstock.comMistakes To Avoid When Shopping at TargetWith great quality items at fair prices, it's hard not to love shopping at Target. But you could be spending too much money at the beloved retailer if you're making any of these mistakes.Lisa Schulz / Shutterstock.comNot Using Your Target RedCard""If you love a bargain and receiving rewards simply for the shopping you would've done anyway, consider opening a credit card -- or even a debit card -- at Target,"" Gramuglia said. ""The Target RedCard gives users a 5% discount on all purchases, free shipping online and access to RedCard Exclusives including special items, gifts and promotions.""You can even save 5% at any in-store Starbucks location when you use your RedCard, Gramuglia said.Tada Images / Shutterstock.comNot Taking Advantage of Target App Coupons""If you haven't already, download the Target app to gain exclusive access to deals and coupons, browse weekly ads and place orders with Drive Up,"" Gramuglia said. ""It's easier than ever to use coupons to save money and time when shopping through the Target app.""Sergei Bachlakov / Shutterstock.comNot Stacking Coupons""At Target, you can use several coupons per transaction unless the coupons indicate otherwise,"" said Trae Bodge, smart shopping expert for TrueTrae.com. ""You can even stack manufacturers' coupons with Target coupons. Look for stackable coupons on Target.com, your local circular and on a deal site like Slickdeals.net, which has a page dedicated to Target coupons.""Julie Clopper / Shutterstock.comPurchasing Items Right AwayYou can sometimes save money by abandoning your online shopping cart.""Stores like Target track our every move while browsing the internet, so when we leave a store's page without making a purchase, they take note of it,"" Gramuglia said. ""If you wait a few days or so, you may receive a 'We miss you!' or 'You forgot something!' email from that store featuring a product you clicked on but didn't buy, and sometimes a customized discount code, too.""ZikG / Shutterstock.comSkipping Over the EndcapsThere's no one clearance section at Target, so it's important to not overlook the clearance areas in the respective sections of the store.""Target scatters their deals and steals throughout the store,"" Gramuglia said. ""And don't ignore the endcaps! You can find some serious savings there.""hobo_018 / Getty ImagesNot Comparison ShoppingAs with Amazon, you may be tempted to purchase everything you need during a single Target shopping trip -- but Target doesn't always have the lowest prices.""You can likely save money simply by comparing your options,"" Gramuglia said. ""Before you purchase an item, check to see if the price is lower at another store, or if another store is having a sale.""Lando Aviles / Shutterstock.comNot Planning Your TripAs is the case with Costco, you should never go to Target without a shopping list.""Target is one of those stores that's really easy to walk out of with more than you intended -- there's even a term for it: the 'Target Effect,'"" Ramhold said. ""A good way to combat this is to plan your trips in minute detail. It sounds overwhelming, but the app can make things much easier as it has a map function so you can pinpoint where the items on your list are. Make your list in the app, note where each item is, and then stick to that list to keep from walking out with five new throw pillows you don't have room for.""Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNot Utilizing the Option To Pick Up In-StoreNot everything on the Target app and site is available for in-store pickup, but if you only need a few things and they are available for pickup or drive up, consider using this functionality.""If you opt for store pickup, you'll go inside and go straight to the service desk to pick up your order when it's ready, and if you opt for drive-up service, they'll bring your order out to you,"" Ramhold said. ""This means you won't even have a chance to be enticed by the cute and useful things in the Dollar Spot, or the selection of snacks up front.""ungvar / Shutterstock.comMistakes To Avoid When Shopping at WalmartWalmart is known for its 'everyday low prices' -- but you still might be spending more than you need to be if you're making these common Walmart shopping mistakes.2p2play / Shutterstock.comBuying Overpriced Items Through a Third-Party SellerLike Amazon, Walmart.com sells items from third-party sellers.""Before you buy something on Walmart.com, do a Google search to see if you are getting the lowest price,"" Gramuglia said. ""For example, a pair of Nike sneakers from a third-party seller on Walmart ranges from $89.22 to $98.52, whereas you can buy the exact same shoe at Dick's Sporting Goods for $54.99. Keep in mind that Walmart does not price match for third-party sellers, so comparing prices prior to purchasing is a must.""Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comBuying Something Just Because the Price Seems Good""Walmart is known for its prices, but whether you are shopping something full-price or on sale at a Rollback price, be sure to always comparison shop to make sure you're actually getting the best deal,"" Gramuglia said. ""Walmart does price-match, but it needs to be the exact item and must apply to other limitations the store sets.""You should also take quality into consideration before making a purchase.""If you find yourself eyeing a product, like a sweater for $10, consider the quality, style, and longevity and usage of the product,"" Gramuglia said. ""Sometimes inexpensive products end up costing you more in replacing the item than it would if you bought a better quality product. However, you can also find quality products at a lower price, so be sure to weigh the pros and cons to make the best decision for your finances.""Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comNot Double-Checking the Price""You may find a clearance item or full-priced item that you've been eyeing, but may want to put it back on the shelf because it's out of your budget. But before you do that, double-check the price,"" Gramuglia said. ""Especially since items can be easily moved throughout the large store, always price check your items for a final verdict. Stores like Walmart are constantly running promotions and have items marked down, and may be running a deal that you don't know about that can save you an extra few bucks. The price scanner will give you the most up-to-date cost.""Jaimieandkyleshootstock / Shutterstock.comShopping Too Late in the DayThe early bird gets the best deals at Walmart.""Making the trip before 9 a.m. is a good idea since that is when everything has been neatly restocked and you have a better chance of getting what you want,"" said Freya Kuka, founder of the personal finance blog Collecting Cents. ""If you are a morning person, this is a great way to start the day.""Icatnews / Shutterstock.comOverlooking Store-Brand Items""Walmart has 'Great Value' options that are branded replacements; [opting for these] can help you save hundreds every month,"" Kuka said. ""In most cases, the brand is nothing but a name in comparison.""Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comShopping for Seasonal Items Too Early""Usually a month before the next major holiday rolls around, Walmart devotes at least one entire aisle to items for it. And yes, it can be tempting to grab a giant bag of Halloween-themed chocolate in mid-September, but if you wait until the day after the holiday, you'll see incredible discounts that make it so much easier to get a bigger bang for your buck,"" Ramhold said. ""Granted, for things like that, you might need themed candies and items before the holiday itself, but we recommend getting only what you need ahead of time, and then treating yourself to goodies the day after the holiday.""Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comThinking 'Rollback' Prices Are the Best Deal You'll Get on an Item""Rollback prices typically last around 90 days, but they aren't actually sale or clearance prices -- they're just a slight price drop due to something like overstock,"" Ramhold said.More From GOBankingRates8 Best New Items Coming to Dollar Tree in 2023What Is the State of Women &amp; Money in 2023?Build Your Credit Score with These Simple StrategiesExperts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 37 Mistakes We Make When Shopping at Costco, Amazon, Target and Walmart]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global jewelry industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Jewelry Companies in the World.Â Market InsightsThe global jewelry market is valued at $249 billion as of 2021 and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 8.5% from 2022 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. As far as materials go, the industry is dominated by gold, silver, platinum and diamond. Gold held the highest revenue share, at 40%, and is projected to maintain its dominant position in the forecast period.Â In terms of product, ring dominates the market with the highest revenue share at 25%. The demand for rings is primarily driven by weddings. It is the most popular wedding jewelry item across many cultures around the world. It is followed by the demand in bracelets, which has a projected CAGR of 8.9% for the period 2022-2030.Â Another important insight from the report shows that Asia-Pacific holds the greatest share of the jewelry market, at a whopping 60%. It can be attributed to the growth in the size of the middle class in countries like China and India, that have a collective population of 2.8 billion.Insofar as the US is concerned, its jewelry market added $47 billion to the global jewelry market in 2021. It grew 27% from 2020, which had seen a 13.4% decline from 2019, presumably due to the onset of the pandemic and the following supply chain disruptions and lockdowns.Â The growth in jewelry market in the US apparently fell in 2022 but that can be interpreted as normal given the pandemic correction in 2021 due to delayed events like weddings. The demand is steadily growing in the US due to falling gold and silver prices, and rising GDP per capita.Â While the pandemic hurt the industry, it was not all bad. A survey conducted by The Plumb Club showed a net 9% respondents saying their jewelry shopping rose amid the pandemic.Â Cultural RoleJewelry is a prominent aspect of many cultures, especially in Asia-Pacific. For instance, in India, there are numerous events that drive up jewelry sales. These include weddings, Diwali as well as other religious events. Further, wearing jewelry is often associated with certain Hindu religious traditions. StarLuxe, Nemichand Bemalwa &amp; Sons, M&amp;B private jewelers, Titan Company, and Chow Tai Fook are some of the top companies in the Asia-Pacific region.Story continuesAnother factor in global jewelry market growth is that men, especially in the western world, have also been increasingly buying more jewelry compared to the past as gender roles lose their grip on society.Â  According to Euromonitor International, menâs jewelry market size is worth $6.5 billion within the larger market as of 2021, indicating a 17% growth from 2020.LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, SociÃ©tÃ© EuropÃ©enne (PARIS:MC.PA) and Chanel are some of the most prominent companies in Europe and North America.Â Other than physical stores, their products can be conveniently purchased online via Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY).Now that weâre done with industry analysis, letâs move on to the 15 biggest jewelry companies in the world.Photo by Fotis Nakos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 15 biggest jewelry companies in the world, weâd be ranking them based on their annual revenue for the latest available fiscal year data.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.So I'm watching the Macy's (M) Thanksgiving Day Parade and was pleasantly surprised to see musical performances by icons Paula Abdul and Mariah Carey on the docket.They both crushed it in my view, and so did Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette sitting behind them in a seasonal bright blue scarf and CEO hair.Then I see that the parade had 27.7 million viewers between linear and streaming platform Peacock â the most in five years and a slight bump from last year's 27.4 million views.Hoda Kotb and Jeff Gennette at the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Photo by: Cara Howe/NBC via Getty Images)Those two wins were enough for me to dive back into Macy's fundamentals for this year.To be clear, I've been super critical of this company for years.Management was painfully slow to close stores. The stores that were opened looked terrible. You couldn't find associates in the store to ask basic questions (for example: Where is the fitting room?). There was too much inventory in the stores. The website was awful, ditto the mobile app. The company was often more inclined to over-promise and badly under-deliver on earnings.However, the winds of positive change appear to have been blowing through Macy's this year, which is even more impressive considering the shifts happening in consumer spending â paying up for experiences and buying less stuff â amid the sluggish economy.Here are a few things that stand out on Macy's fundamentally on this Cyber Monday:The stock has pretty much out-performed the S&amp;P 500 for the majority of 2022. No small feat given the hate for consumer discretionary stocks with recession fears swirling.Inventory levels are some of the healthiest among rival department stores, reflecting management efforts to fine-tune assortment planning.Same-store sales are out-performing rival department stores such as Kohl's.Bloomingdale's is having a good year despite higher income shoppers pulling back on their spending amid stock market wealth destruction.Story continuesI am not alone in spotting a revival in Macy's fortunes.""Think about what has happened over the last three years,"" former department store executive and frequent Yahoo Finance Live guest Jan Rogers Kniffen told me.""First, J.C. Penney completely imploded and reconstituted itself as a much smaller competitor â and the bottom 40% of Macy's business always overlapped JCP's business. Kohl's, which also overlaps the bottom 40% of Macy's business, slowed a lot as a competitor â it lost share, dropped volume and became less competitive. Then, Nordstrom, which has always overlapped the top 25% of Macy's business and more like 50% in some of Macy's best stores, started shooting itself in the foot.""Kniffen also agreed in Macy's doing a better job managing inventory and getting store expenses under wraps.Mariah Carey at the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (Photo by: Cara Howe/NBC via Getty Images)By no means is Macy's in perfect fundamental shape, something captured in the stock trading at a 65% discount to the S&amp;P 500 on a forward P/E basis. Same-store sales are still under pressure, and the retailer still operates 770 plus physical stores in the age of digital. The short-term margin outlook is murky at best given the promotional intensity in retail right now. The company just cut its 4Q guidance two weeks ago too, owing to a slow start to holiday spending this month.But I must give Macy's credit where credit is due â they are operating a better department store and it's starting to show up in the financials. How that plays out in the stock price in 2023... is for you to assess.Happy Trading!What to Watch TodayEconomyDallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, November (-23.0 expected, -19.4 during prior month)EarningsArrowhead (ARWR), AZEK (AZEK)âClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Other Asia bourses weakened in tandem.A U.S. regulatory clampdown on Chinese tech giants, citing national security concerns, also weighed on shares of tech firms.And developments on the street meant little solace was taken from Friday's central bank decision to cut banks' required reserve ratios, even though this and the prospect of further easing added pressure to the Chinese currency.European stocks and U.S. futures fell too on Monday. Broad dollar gains reversed quickly, however, as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields skidded to their lowest in almost two months.The recession signal from the U.S. yield curve between 3 months and 10 years inverted further to almost 70 basis points - its most negative in almost 22 years.Financial markets have for weeks looked positively at even the vaguest hint of China's curbs easing - with many asset managers still assuming the restrictions will eventually lift by the end of the first quarter of 2023.This now may seem harder to parse.Whether the widening unrest creates a new level of unpredictable political risk in China or merely accelerates some government exit from the draconian 'zero COVID' strategy - or even a U-turn on buying foreign vaccines - remains unclear.Story continuesAs U.S. markets return after the Thanksgiving weekend, attention will return to Federal Reserve tightening, the labour market and inflation picture. Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks on Wednesday, with the November U.S. jobs report out on Friday.A bear market rally in equities may continue into next year before relapsing as a recession in the world economy takes hold, Deutsche Bank said in its 2023 economic outlook published on Monday. The German banking giant said it expected U.S. output to drop 2% over the whole year, euro zone output to decline 1% and world economic growth to slow to a recessionary 2%.It also sees the euro/dollar exchange rate rising steadily to $1.10 by the end of 2023, 10-year Treasury yields staying constant at 3.65%, Brent crude falling to $80 per barrel and credit spreads widening.Developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Monday: * Dallas Fed Nov manfacturing index; New York Federal Reserve President John Williams speaks * European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde at European Parliament. ECB board member Elizabeth McCaul speaks in London * UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak speaks at Lord Mayor's Banquet(By Mike Dolan, editing by Barbara Lewis mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

Desperate to retain the staff, the facility is offering $1,800 bonuses.The higher-end versionsâthe iPhone 14 Pro and Pro maxâare exclusively produced in Zhengzhou. âThat suggests to me that the higher-end iPhones have a different set of production processes, which is not very easy to be transferred elsewhere,â Martin Yang, senior analyst of emerging technologies of investment firm Oppenheimer, told CNBCâs Street Signs Asia. âAnd oftentimes that refers to very custom equipment and a trained workforce that are not readily available elsewhere.âCan China recover?If China continues to tighten its grip on its people and its commerce, investors will likely turn more risk averse.Listening to the demonstratorsâ demands could help Chinese economyâs stewards decide next steps, offering more clarity and assurance.âProtests could also be the catalyst that leads to a positive outcome in leading the government to set a clearer game plan on how the country is going to learn to live with covid, setting a more transparent timetable, and accelerating Chinaâs move to living with covid,â Robert Subbaraman, chief economist at Japanâs financial services group Nomura, told Reuters.Related storiesð« Apple hobbled a crucial tool of dissent in China weeks before widespread protests broke outð Reports of violent protests at Foxconnâs iPhone factory show Chinaâs harsh covid policies reaching a tipping pointð¨ð³ Unusually bold public dissent comes before Xi Jinpingâs pivotal Party Congress meetingMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) share price is up 18% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 5.1%.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for FirstEnergy While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years of share price growth, FirstEnergy moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on FirstEnergy's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, FirstEnergy's TSR for the last 5 years was 45%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that FirstEnergy shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.3% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 8%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  FirstEnergy is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...Of course FirstEnergy may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to read about some more tech stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks to Consider.There is broad-based consensus among finance professionals that the traditional definitions of growth and value stocks do hold-up very well in the present economy. This is because the technology sector has disrupted almost every major industry and is now a critical part of the overall economy, and firms like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are now established businesses with strong profiles that are not, in the ordinary sense of the word, exclusively growth-oriented.There are examples which illustrate this point. Peter Thiel, a famous entrepreneur, grew a $1,700 investment in tech stocks to a multi-billion dollar tax-free payout over the course of two decades. During the pandemic, the shift towards digital also demonstrated the safety of tech stocks as businesses altered their models to incorporate the changing consumer demands. Investors are now discarding value sectors like utilities and consumer goods in favor of tech-led disruptors for better returns in the long-term.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the technology sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Tech Stocks to Consider11. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Â Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) a biotech company that discovers, develops, and commercializes medicines. It is one of the best safe tech stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 31, Maxim analyst Jason McCarthy maintained a Buy rating on Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock and raised the price target to $92 from $84, noting that the company's third quarter results were strong due to the Veklury and HIV franchise. Â Story continuesAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrow Street Capital is a leading shareholder in Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) with 12 million shares worth more than $742.5 million.Â Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is one of the safe tech stocks for a retirement portfolio.Â In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOther pharma companies are providing solutions as well. Biopharmaceutical companyÂ Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)âs remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication administered by intravenous infusion; it can shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in non-hospitalized patients.â10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Â  Â Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. It is one of the top safe tech stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 4, Micron Technology said that it would spend $100 billion on a massive new chip making facility in upstate New York in another sign that new federal investments are stimulating domestic investment in the semiconductor industry.On October 13, Loop Capital analyst Charles Park initiated coverage of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock with a Buy rating and $70 price target, noting that the key metrics show that the memory industry is nearing a bottom and the risk/reward appears favorable.Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âMicron Technology, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micronâs stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.â9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Â  Â Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. It is one of the premier safe tech stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 3, Teslaâs CEO Elon Musk said he planned to triple the size of its factory in southeast Berlin. Tesla required 1.4 million cubic meters of water every year to cast vehicle parts and cool heavy machinery and painting jobs.

(NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion.Â Â In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn 2014, before we began to invest inÂ TeslaÂ (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Muskâs electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Teslaâs prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motorsâ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read moreâ¦)8.

Here is what the fund said:âAt the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIAâs stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIAâs revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and MLâ¦(read more)7.

Their products are a key element in driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time.

The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that weâve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforceâs strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next yearâs revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.âÂ Click to continue reading and see Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks to Consider.Â Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global jewelry industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Jewelry Companies in the World.Â Market InsightsThe global jewelry market is valued at $249 billion as of 2021 and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 8.5% from 2022 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. As far as materials go, the industry is dominated by gold, silver, platinum and diamond. Gold held the highest revenue share, at 40%, and is projected to maintain its dominant position in the forecast period.Â In terms of product, ring dominates the market with the highest revenue share at 25%. The demand for rings is primarily driven by weddings. It is the most popular wedding jewelry item across many cultures around the world. It is followed by the demand in bracelets, which has a projected CAGR of 8.9% for the period 2022-2030.Â Another important insight from the report shows that Asia-Pacific holds the greatest share of the jewelry market, at a whopping 60%. It can be attributed to the growth in the size of the middle class in countries like China and India, that have a collective population of 2.8 billion.Insofar as the US is concerned, its jewelry market added $47 billion to the global jewelry market in 2021. It grew 27% from 2020, which had seen a 13.4% decline from 2019, presumably due to the onset of the pandemic and the following supply chain disruptions and lockdowns.Â The growth in jewelry market in the US apparently fell in 2022 but that can be interpreted as normal given the pandemic correction in 2021 due to delayed events like weddings. The demand is steadily growing in the US due to falling gold and silver prices, and rising GDP per capita.Â While the pandemic hurt the industry, it was not all bad. A survey conducted by The Plumb Club showed a net 9% respondents saying their jewelry shopping rose amid the pandemic.Â Cultural RoleJewelry is a prominent aspect of many cultures, especially in Asia-Pacific. For instance, in India, there are numerous events that drive up jewelry sales. These include weddings, Diwali as well as other religious events. Further, wearing jewelry is often associated with certain Hindu religious traditions. StarLuxe, Nemichand Bemalwa &amp; Sons, M&amp;B private jewelers, Titan Company, and Chow Tai Fook are some of the top companies in the Asia-Pacific region.Story continuesAnother factor in global jewelry market growth is that men, especially in the western world, have also been increasingly buying more jewelry compared to the past as gender roles lose their grip on society.Â  According to Euromonitor International, menâs jewelry market size is worth $6.5 billion within the larger market as of 2021, indicating a 17% growth from 2020.LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, SociÃ©tÃ© EuropÃ©enne (PARIS:MC.PA) and Chanel are some of the most prominent companies in Europe and North America.Â Other than physical stores, their products can be conveniently purchased online via Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY).Now that weâre done with industry analysis, letâs move on to the 15 biggest jewelry companies in the world.Photo by Fotis Nakos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 15 biggest jewelry companies in the world, weâd be ranking them based on their annual revenue for the latest available fiscal year data.

The asset managers at Hartford Financial Services looked at the performance of the benchmark S&amp;P 500 going all the way back to 1930 and found there was not a single decade in which dividend stocks in the index didn't generate positive returns, even when the broader market was losing money for investors.Continue reading]"

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.49bUS$1.83bUS$2.19bUS$2.25bUS$2.31bUS$2.36bUS$2.42bUS$2.47bUS$2.52bUS$2.57bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.25%Est @ 2.17%Est @ 2.11%Est @ 2.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$1.4kUS$1.6kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$2.6bÃ (1 + 2.0%) Ã· (6.1%â 2.0%) = US$64bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$64bÃ· ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$35bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$52b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$103, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Monster Beverage as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Shareholders not resident in Sweden who wish to accept the Offer (as defined below) must make inquiries concerning applicable legislation and possible tax consequences. Shareholders should refer to the offer restrictions included in the section titled ""Important information"" at the end of this announcement and in the offer document, which has been published on the Offer website (www.smokefree-offer.com). Shareholders in the United States should also refer to the section entitled ""Special notice to shareholders in the United States"" at the end of this announcement.On May 11, 2022, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V.1 (""PMHH""), an affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (""PMI""), announced a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (""Swedish Match"") to tender all shares in Swedish Match2 to PMHH (the ""Offer""). On November 7, 2022, PMHH declared the Offer unconditional and announced that it would complete the Offer and acquire all shares in Swedish Match that have been tendered in the Offer. In addition, PMHH extended the acceptance period until November 25, 2022 and informed the Swedish Match shareholders that the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period would be reduced to SEK 115.07 in cash per share due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share for shareholders of record as of November 14, 2022. Today, PMHH announces that it becomes the owner of 93.11 percent2 of the shares in Swedish Match.The Offer is now closed. The shares tendered in the Offer at the end of the acceptance period (which expired on November 4, 2022) amounted to in aggregate 1,255,989,816 shares in Swedish Match2, corresponding to approximately 82.59 percent2 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match. On November 10, 2022, PMHH announced that PMHH had acquired 49,899,948 shares in Swedish Match outside the Offer, corresponding to approximately 3.28 percent2 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match, since the announcement of the outcome of the Offer on November 7, 2022.Story continuesThe shares tendered in the Offer during the further extended acceptance period (which expired on November 25, 2022) amount to in aggregate 80,933,854 shares in Swedish Match, corresponding to approximately 5.32 percent2 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match. In addition, PMHH has acquired an additional 29,164,342 shares in Swedish Match outside the Offer, corresponding to approximately 1.92 percent2 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match, since the announcement of the press release on November 10, 2022. No acquisitions have been made at a price exceeding the price in the Offer.Accordingly, the total number of shares in Swedish Match held by PMHH, including the shares tendered in the Offer at the end of the further extended acceptance period on November 25, 2022, amounts to 1,415,987,960 shares, corresponding to approximately 93.11 percent2 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match.""We are delighted to have obtained over 90% ownership of Swedish Match, allowing us to initiate a minority redemption process to acquire the remaining shares outstanding and request the delisting of the company from the stock market,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer of PMI. ""This transaction marks a major milestone in accelerating our shared objective of a smoke-free future. We look forward to welcoming Swedish Matchâs employees and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI family to create a global smoke-free champion, notably bringing IQOS and ZYN together in both the U.S. and international markets. We are very excited about the growth, value creation and progress in Tobacco Harm Reduction that we believe can be achieved together over the coming years. Despite the increased cost of financing over recent months, we expect the combination to be low single-digit accretive to PMIâs adjusted diluted EPS in 2023, before potential revenue synergies and excluding transaction-related and one-off costs and the amortization of acquired intangibles.""Background and Transaction rationaleIn 2016, PMI announced its new mission to replace cigarettes with science-based, less harmful alternatives as soon as possibleâto the benefit of people who smoke, public health, PMI, and society. The proof of PMI's commitment to this mission and strong progress to date is undeniable: In 2015, essentially all of PMI's net revenues came from cigarettes. In 2021, nearly 30 percent came from smoke-free products. By 2025, PMI aims to be a predominantly smoke-free company, with more than half of its net revenues coming from such products.While cigarettes represent PMI's past and are part of its present, they do not represent its future. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion in researching, developing, and commercializing its smoke-free products. PMI has built world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of preclinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. And it has met the strictest regulatory requirements for its sector, including in the U.S., where the Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI's leading heated tobacco product, IQOS, as ""modified risk tobacco products"" (MRTPs), finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health.PMI and Swedish Match share a mutual vision of a world without cigarettes and a strong commitment to developing, scientifically substantiating, and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than cigarettes. PMI values how Swedish Match has relentlessly pursued tobacco harm reduction through its range of smoke-free products; received authorizations for its products via strict regulatory pathways in the U.S.; and reshaped the public health environment in countries such as Sweden and Norway.As PMI continues to evolve its business for the long term, it believes that the two companies will be a perfect pairing of strategic vision, culture, and enterprise. Together, the companies will be able to create a global, science-led smoke-free champion, combining expertise in heated tobacco and oral nicotineâincluding multiple MRTP authorizationsâas well as PMI's emerging presence in e-vapor products, to switch more adult smokers to better alternatives than the two could achieve as separate companies. Swedish Match will lead the combined companyâs oral nicotine business.The combination with Swedish Match positions PMI to:create a comprehensive smoke-free product portfolio globally, underpinned by a leading R&amp;D engine for science, innovation, and growth through the companies' complementary capabilities;directly enter and compete in the large, attractive and growing U.S. smoke-free market by: (i) further supporting and developing Swedish Match's oral nicotine portfolio in the U.S. and (ii) leveraging Swedish Match's substantial operational platform in the U.S. to unlock commercial opportunities across other smoke-free categories in the coming years, including with IQOS as of April 30, 2024; anddrive accelerated global expansion opportunities for Swedish Match's oral nicotine products through PMI's international commercial infrastructure and financial resources.We expect that the combination will immediately enhance PMI's already strong growth profile and support additional opportunities in the U.S. and internationally over time. Despite the increased cost of financing over recent months, we expect the combination to be low single-digit accretive to PMIâs adjusted diluted EPS in 2023, before potential revenue synergies and excluding transaction-related and one-off costs and the amortization of acquired intangibles. Importantly, Swedish Match's operating cash flow comprises meaningful U.S. dollar net income, thereby improving PMI's currency profile.The transaction will result in a combined company with a strong balance sheet and leverage of approximately 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, with deleveraging anticipated over the next few years. PMI remains committed to its strong single-A credit ratings, as a growing and highly cash-generative business. To support deleveraging, PMI has suspended its current three-year share repurchase program, which began in July 2021. PMI also remains committed to its progressive dividend policy, while gradually reducing its adjusted diluted EPS payout ratio to around 75% over time.PMI recognizes that the employees and management team of Swedish Match have built a highly successful business with an excellent track record, and PMI has the utmost respect for them. PMI's current plans for the future business and general strategy, as described above, do not include any material changes with regard to Swedish Match's operational sites, or its management and employees, including their terms of employment. Swedish Match has a complementary organization with a talented, dedicated workforce, excellent culture and a strong base of skills in Sweden, the U.S. and across the world. PMI intends to nurture this talent and provide additional opportunities as the companies grow together. Importantly, PMI intends to provide compensation and benefits consistent with Swedish Match's current programs, including the Profit Sharing Foundation in Sweden. In addition, PMI intends to preserve and develop Swedish Match's operational presence in Sweden, where much of the companyâs skills base is located, as well as in Richmond, Virginia, the site of the head office for Swedish Match's U.S. Division. PMI has no plans to divest the Lights business.Certain terms of the OfferPMHH has decided not to further extend the acceptance period. Settlement for shares tendered in the Offer during the extended acceptance period (which expired on November 25, 2022), is expected to be initiated around December 2, 2022. PMHH reserves the right to postpone the settlement date, provided however, that settlement shall in any event be made within 7 business days following the expiration of the acceptance period. PMHH will announce any postponement of the settlement date by a press release in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.PMHH intends to initiate compulsory redemption under the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)) to acquire all remaining shares in Swedish Match. PMHH also intends to request delisting of Swedish Matchâs shares from Nasdaq Stockholm.Prior to the announcement of the Offer, neither PMHH nor any closely related companies or closely related parties owned or otherwise controlled any shares in Swedish Match or other financial instruments that give financial exposure to Swedish Matchâs shares. Apart from the 79,064,290 shares in Swedish Match that PMHH has acquired outside the Offer, as described above, neither PMHH or any closely related companies or closely related parties have acquired any shares in Swedish Match or other financial instruments that give financial exposure to Swedish Matchâs shares outside the Offer. To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations, PMHH and its affiliates may acquire, or take measures to acquire, additional shares in Swedish Match in other ways than through the Offer. Information about such acquisitions of shares, or measures to acquire shares, will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.Due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share with record date for the payment on November 14, 2022, and date for payment through Euroclear Sweden on November 17, 2022, the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period has, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer4, been reduced accordingly to SEK 115.07 in cash per share.

36,0fce63d9-34a8-3faa-b3fb-2bd924ca9587,PM,2022-11-28,Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-nyse-110019808.html,1669633219,STORY,['PM'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Philip Morris International. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Philip Morris International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Philip Morris International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Philip Morris International. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.5% and 6.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Philip Morris International Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$241m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Philip Morris International. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

37,e0097cf1-1a07-37a7-b3ed-d45cae3c41a8,GS,2022-11-28,15 Biggest Holding Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-holding-companies-world-180637937.html,1669572397,STORY,"['PNC', 'BAC', 'GSBD', 'WFC-PD', 'SCHW', 'BRK-B', 'CMCSA', 'DIS', 'JNJ', 'C']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest holding companies in the world. For more companies,Â  head on over to 5 Biggest Holding Companies in the World. A holding company is quite common in the business world, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance. They are created due to the fact that holding companies and their subsidiaries are separate entities. So if the subsidiary encounters any problems, or goes bankrupt for instance, the parent will be shielded from the subsequent liability requirements.In the financial world, there are different kinds of firms that are involved in the business of investing in other companies. Apart from holding companies, hedge funds and mutual funds also acquire an interest in firms. However, the primary difference between these and a holding company is that the former two do not acquire a controlling stake that provides them with the ability to set management and decide on the long term strategic objectives of the target firm. However, a holding company generally does acquire a controlling stake, and due to this, it is also entitled to the profits of a subsidiary. The percentage of the share in profits depends on the controlling stake and is listed after the subsidiary has accounted for all business expenses, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax payments.Holding companies also offer tax advantages, if the parent company is headquartered in a low tax rate region. Additionally, the subsidiaries can either be acquired through purchasing shares or if a larger entity decides to spin off a business unit.There are some limitations to a holding company though. For instance, a holding company cannot acquire a stake in either an S Corp or a sole proprietorship. S companies are exempt from paying taxes, and instead, their profits are routed back to the owners who then pay income taxes. Additionally, while the picture might be rosy for the parent, it comes with a myriad of risks for the subsidiary. The subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Finally, multinationals often face difficulties in transferring their profits across countries due to a lack of standardized tax rules that leads to double taxation on the profits depending on the route that the profits take from the subsidiaries to the parent.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take a look at some of the biggest holding companies in the world. Most of these are banks, but there are others as well. Renowned names include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the hedge fund, its investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to Was Joseph Samuels's Islet Management Right About These 5 Stocks?We prepared the actual contents of this article in November last year, when we analyzed the Q2 portfolio of Joseph Samuels's Islet Management to discuss some of the notable stocks in the hedge fund portfolio at that time. We are publishing this article today because itâs always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called âsmart moneyâ is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong.In this article you will see the notable stock picks of Joseph Samuels's Islet Management as of the second quarter of last year.To assess the performance of these stocks, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months through November 27, 2022.At the time of writing we had mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks from famous Wall Street analysts. Itâd be interesting for our readers to see how right or wrong were these analystsâ price targets and calls.However, we should keep the 2022 market crash in mind when reading this article. You will notice that most of the stocks in this list lost value over the past 12 months. That doesnât, however, mean that the hedge fund was entirely wrong. The fund believes in holding stocks for longer periods of time. These holdings might end up creating profits for the hedge fund in the months and years to come as analysts believe the market could rebound strongly in 2023 and beyond.Itâs also important to note that the hedge fund sold or reduced its stakes in some of these stocks in the subsequent quarters of 2021 and 2022.Story continuesNow, letâs start the article by first reading the introduction to the hedge fund we wrote back in November 2021.Islet Management is a New-York based hedge fund that was founded by Mr. Joseph Samuels after he left his position as head of US equities and executive managing director at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group in July 2016. He worked at Och-Ziff Capital for 13 years. Before joining Och-Ziff, Mr. Samuels worked at the discontinued Pequot Capital Management and Merrill Lynch.Mr. Samuels' hedge fund uses a tactical long/short equity strategy focused on pinpointing and benefitting from three key opportunities, namely dislocations, transformative corporate events, and capital market opportunities.Dislocations in the market take place under stressful conditions that result in the mispricing of assets at a broad level. This theme came into play during the COVID-19 pandemic as various sectors came to a halt, resulting in the stock price of numerous prominent corporations plummeting, despite the businesses having strong fundamentals.The theme of a transformative business event is very much self-explanatory and the hedge fund is focused on capitalizing on such events for a corporation by taking a long/short position. According to Insider Monkey's database, the portfolio value of Joseph Samuel's Islet Management stood at approximately $3.63 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021.10.

However, the company is now facing new challenges in the form of supply chain disruptions and higher commodity prices globally. Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Plc (NASDAQ:CCEP) has pricing, productivity, and cost levers to counter these disruptions.On November 10, Mitch Collett at Deutsche Bank raised the target price on Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Plc (NASDAQ:CCEP) from $71 to $73, while maintaining a Buy rating.9.

Hereâs what the fund said:""Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) provides predictive analytics and data management products and services that enable business to automate, improve, and connect decisions. The stock underperformed in the quarter despite posting solid earnings. The recent pressure in the firmâs shares stems from investor concerns that FICO could see a dramatic slowdown in its mortgage business due to intrusion from a competitor as well as the potential for further rising interest rates. At the moment, we feel as though these concerns are overblown and continue to hold the stock.""8. Lightspeed Commerce Inc.

43,64640bda-8272-364b-870a-efb800209640,PSX,2022-11-28,Investing in Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) a year ago would have delivered you a 67% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-phillips-66-nyse-psx-124302193.html,1669639382,STORY,['PSX'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) share price is 60% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 18% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. Unfortunately the longer term returns are not so good, with the stock falling 3.4% in the last three years.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last year Phillips 66 grew its earnings per share, moving from a loss to a profit.When a company has just transitioned to profitability, earnings per share growth is not always the best way to look at the share price action.We think that the revenue growth of 70% could have some investors interested. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthPhillips 66 is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Phillips 66 the TSR over the last 1 year was 67%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Phillips 66 shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 67% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 7% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Phillips 66 (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

A deeper analysis revealed that nearly 2/3 of total production was found to have an intensity below that basin-wide average. Meanwhile, assets responsible for just 20 percent of total production generated half of the basin's total GHG emissions.Overall, individual assets across the basin displayed a wide variability, ranging in GHG intensity from less than 1 kgCO2e/boe to nearly 150 kgCO2e/boe. Such a wide range is consistent across all the regions that have been explored to date and highlights the challenges of averages, the report finds.The findings are derived from a new S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights capability that provides a novel and comprehensive approach to estimating upstream oil and gas production emissions. The new capability, built upon existing proprietary upstream databases and emerging sources such as reported emissions and satellite flaring data from the Earth Observation Group, makes it possible to estimate the totality of an upstream oil and gas play's emissions and emissions intensityâfrom across the play, down to individual assets and the sources of emissions, such as the fuels, that underpin each operation.""In every play where we have looked, we continue to find wide variability in the greenhouse gas intensity with any one asset potentially being significantly different from the average,"" said Kevin Birn, Global Head for S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights newly formed Centre of Emissions Excellence. ""The new S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights capability delivers a level of granularity that is essential for governments, investors, and frankly the market to truly understand the nature of upstream oil and gas emissions, down to individual assets and the drivers behind each assets emissions, such as fuels that get used.""Story continuesThe considerable variability of the findings illustrates several key factors that ultimately influence the GHG intensity of an asset. These include productivity, where younger and more productive fields tend to be less GHG intensive than older, more geologically challenging fields. The latter also may require energy-intensive enhanced recovery techniques, increased drilling to maintain productivity, and older technology can also put upward pressure on emissions intensity.Other factors that impact the GHG intensity of individual assets include the degree to which operations can be electrified and the degree of venting and flaring.""The scale and complexity of operations across the North Seaâa complex network of offshore platforms, drilling operations, subsea recovery units and pipelinesâdemonstrate how myriad factors influence the greenhouse gas intensity of any one asset,"" Christopher Kennett, associate director, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""The potential for wide variability makes understanding these factors at the asset-to-asset level all the more essential.""The S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights analysis compared production in the United Kingdom and Norwegian areas of the North Sea to illustrate the influence of these factors.The analysis found that, on average, UK production in the North Sea was nearly 3 times more GHG intensive (23 kgCO2e/boe) than Norwegian production (8 kgCO2e/boe).Norwegian operations were advantaged on a GHG intensity basis as, on average, fields tended to be less mature and with a greater share of output from larger, more productive, and technologically advanced operations. Additionally, Norway benefited from electrification projects that tie back to Norway's relatively low-emission, hydro-dominated power grid.By comparison, UK North Sea output tended to come from smaller, more mature or more geologically challenging fields, as well as from fields with older infrastructure and technology. These factors resulted in lower productivity and thus higher GHG intensity, the analysis finds. UK operations also had wider use of flaringâflaring and venting accounted for 28% of total UK North Sea emissions compared to 9% for Norwayâand, unlike Norway, did not benefit from electrification projects to offset emissions from fuel combustion.""With the acceleration of global ambition to tackle climate change, there is increasing need by market participants to better understand the GHG competitiveness of oil and gas assets globally,"" Birn said. ""S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights is supporting this process by shedding new light and understanding on the true nature of upstream GHG emissions at an unprecedented level of granularity.""Additional resources:Full report: https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ci/Info/0922/north-sea-upstream-emissions-benchmark.htmlBlog post: www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ci/research-analysis/the-ghg-intensity-of-the-north-sea.htmlMedia Contacts: S&amp;P Global: Jeff Marn +1-202-463-8213, Jeff.marn@spglobal.comS&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, Global/EMEA:Â Paul Sandell + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.comÂ Americas:Â Kathleen TanzyÂ + 1 917-331-4607,Â kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia:Â Melissa Tan +Â 65-6597-6241,Â melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

51,9ee784a3-8cc6-3bc7-9acb-7d9044f77be9,MA,2022-11-28,Is There Now An Opportunity In Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-mastercard-incorporated-nyse-110013483.html,1669633213,STORY,['MA'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stockâs share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Mastercardâs outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Mastercard What's The Opportunity In Mastercard?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. Itâs trading around 8.5% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Mastercard today, youâd be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the companyâs true value is $384.05, then there isnât much room for the share price grow beyond what itâs currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Mastercardâs share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Mastercard look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so letâs also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 56% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Mastercard. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? MAâs optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we havenât considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If youâve been keeping an eye on MA, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means itâs worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

52,e48904b8-25b5-3161-8e5d-50248c3a49ae,MA,2022-11-28,Why Mastercard Offers Good Risk-Reward Odds,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mastercard-offers-good-risk-215051438.html,1669413051,STORY,"['VALU', 'MA']","[Shares of Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) have fallen a little more than 6% year-to-date, which is better than the 14% decline in the S&amp;P 500 Index. Despite not participating much in the general market correction, Mastercard still trades below its GF Value. By my estimations, this stock could offer an excellent risk-reward scenario for those investors looking for high-quality and undervalued stocks. Here's why.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA. Click here to check it out. MA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MAPeter Lynch Chart of MATakeaways from recent earnings results Mastercard last reported third-quarter earnings results on Oct. 27. The companys revenue increased almost 16% to $5.8 billion while adjusted earnings per share of $2.68 showed 13% growth versus the prior-years period of $2.37. Both results were ahead of what analysts had anticipated.For context, Mastercards revenue grew 30% and earnings per share improved 48% in the third quarter of 2021, so the most recent quarter was coming off one of the best comparable periods of the last five years for the company.In local currency, gross dollar volumes improved 11% to $2.1 trillion, with the U.S. up 10% and the rest of the world growing 12%.Cross border volumes, which are a lucrative business for Mastercard and other credit card companies, were higher by 44%, which was down from 58% growth in second quarter of 2022. The improvement in cross-border volume is an important mark for the company, led by air travel rates beginning to normalize against 2019 levels. European and North American air travel were still down 18% and 10%, respectively, from pre-pandemic levels, but this was an improvement over previous periods.Though cross-border growth did decline somewhat on a sequential basis, outside of Europe, volume increased more than 50% from the previous year and travel-related volume is well above even pre-pandemic 2019 levels.Mastercard did see a 17% spike in expenses for the period due to costs incurred from acquisitions, higher personnel expenses, advertising and data processing costs. However, the companys adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 57.7%, showing that Mastercards spending isnt impacting its ability to improve its profitability.Story continuesAccording to Morningstar Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN), analysts expect Mastercard to earn $10.36 per share in 2022, which would represent growth of 18.3% from the prior year. Revenue is projected to grow 17.5% to $22.2 billion for the year.A high-quality name trading below GF ValueAnalysts expect that Mastercard will see double-digit growth for both revenue and earnings per share this year. This shouldnt surprise those that follow the name as high teens growth on both the top and bottom lines has been a long-term trend enjoyed by the shareholders.Why Mastercard Offers Good Risk-Reward OddsAside from 2020, both revenue and net income have steadily increased for the vast majority of the last decade. This speaks to the strength of the business model and the quality name of Mastercard.The company is one of the rare few with a GF Score of 98 out of 100:Why Mastercard Offers Good Risk-Reward OddsOf the five components that comprise the GF Score, Mastercard receives a 10 out of 10 from GuruFocus in all but one area, financial strength.The most impressive of these is on profitability, where the company ranks ahead of at least two-thirds of the competition and most metrics score near the top of the group. Mastercards return on invested capital (ROIC) is very close to the top of its peer group, showing that the companys investment dollars are leading directly to bottom-line growth. This has helped the company be profitable every year for the last decade.Growth is also a standout, driven by future revenue and earnings growth estimates for the next three to five years that are ahead of what Mastercard has seen over the last three years (data from Morningstar analysts). Companies with market capitalizations approaching $340 billion typically dont grow at extremely high rates, but analysts are predicting that Mastercard will do just that.Financial strength is the lone category where Mastercard doesnt have a perfect score, but the company does have a solid score of 6 out of 10. The primary reason for this is that debt levels have increased dramatically. Mastercard had zero long-term debt on its balance sheet as recently as 2013, but that figure stands at nearly $14 billion as of the most recent quarter. The debt metrics, particularly cash-to-debt and debt-to-equity, are below two-thirds of peers and, more importantly, are at the lowest levels for the company in the last 10 years.On the plus side, the companys Piotroski F-Score is 8 out of 9, indicating that Mastercard is in strong financial position. The Altman Z-Score is very much in the safe reading, meaning that it is very unlikely that the company is at risk for bankruptcy. Mastercards ability to turn invested dollars into profits is once again reflected in the return on invested capital (ROIC) and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) scores of 42.5% and 8.8%, respectively.The stock does sit at 33.6 times forward earnings estimates, but this isnt too far off of its 10-year average price-earnings ratio of 30, according to Value Line.Mastercard is trading at a discount to fair value according to the GF Value chart.Why Mastercard Offers Good Risk-Reward OddsWith a current share price of $348.64, Mastercard has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.74, implying a possible return of 35% from current levels if the stock were to reach its GF Value. The stock offers a small dividend yield of 0.6%, but the dividend has doubled over the last five years.Final thoughtsMastercard continues to grow well as a dominant player in the U.S. payments processing industry. This is made more impressive by the fact that the company is lapping comparable periods where growth was especially high.This type of performance has come to be expected from the company over the long-term and is made possible by its high scores on various fundamental metrics. This is likely to continue as revenue and earnings projections over the medium-term are ahead of what the company has seen over the past few years.The stock is trading at a premium to its historical valuation, though the top- and bottom-lines are expected to grow at a higher than historical rate.Given these factors, Mastercard would appear to have earned its premium multiple in my opinon Using the GF Value chart, the stock appears attractively priced and could lead to mid-30% returns by my estimates, giving Mastercard a good risk-reward profile.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

To see more such stocks and their performance, go to Was Arrowstreet Capital Right About These 5 Finance Stocks? We prepared the actual contents of this article in January this year, when we analyzed the Q3 portfolio of Arrowstreet Capital to discuss the top 10 finance picks of the hedge fund at that time. We are publishing this article today because itâs always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called âsmart moneyâ is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong. In this article you will see the top 10 finance stock picks of Arrowstreet Capital as of the third quarter of last year. To assess the performance of these stocks and the hedge fund, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months through November 25. At the time of writing we had mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks from famous Wall Street analysts. Itâd be interesting for our readers to see how right or wrong were these analystsâ price targets and calls.An investment manager based in Boston, Arrowstreet Capital serves over 200 clients in North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions. The hedge fund was founded in 1999 by Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and Harvard professor John Campbell, and as of Q3 2021, it manages a portfolio worth approximately $80 billion, as well as discretionary assets under management of $152.3 billion.The investment strategies at Arrowstreet Capital include long-only, alpha extension, and long/short, and the fund leverages multiple investment vehicles including swaps and futures. The fund focuses on quantitative investing, tracking risk, costs, and rewards via elaborate transaction models.Â Story continuesArrowstreet Capital is known for responsible investing, keeping in mind the ESG considerations which can directly impact profitability and sustainability of earnings. The hedge fund primarily invests in the information technology, healthcare, finance, communications, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples sectors, with a top ten holdings concentration of 18.97%.Â 10 Finance Stocks to Buy According to Arrowstreet Capital Peter Rathjens of Arrowstreet Capital10. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Arrowstreet Capitalâs Stake Value: $169,519,000Â Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -38%Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based financial technology company providing financial products and services. The company specializes in banking technology, payment technology, processing services, and information based services. Arrowstreet Capital owns 1.39 million Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) shares as of September 2021, worth $169.5 million, representing 0.21% of the fundâs 13F portfolio.Â Moshe Katri from the investment advisory Wedbush lowered the price target on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) to $130 from $182 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares, citing reduced consumer spending due to inflationary pressure on prices of staple goods.Â Here is what Baron FinTech Fund has to say about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:âFidelity National Information Services, Inc. provides software to financial institutions and enables merchants to accept electronic payments. The company reported solid quarterly financial results that exceeded expectations and raised annual guidance for revenue and earnings. However, the stock fell due to concerns that Fidelity Nationalâs legacy technology is losing market share to newer competitors with more modern technology. We believe these concerns are overblown and that Fidelity National remains well positioned to grow revenues organically at a high single-digit rate and earnings at a double-digit rate over time.â9. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Arrowstreet Capitalâs Stake Value: $206,488,000Â Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -37%Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), a New York-based alternative investment and private equity firm, is one of the top finance stocks to buy according to Arrowstreet Capital. The hedge fund elevated its position in Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) by 49% in the third quarter, holding a total of 1.77 million shares worth $206.4 million.Â Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $190 from $152 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on December 17. The analyst heads into 2022 ""even more constructive than at the start of 2021"" on the brokers, asset managers, and exchanges sector.Rajiv Jainâs GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) as of September 2021, with 6.3 million shares worth $736.8 million. Overall, 54 hedge funds in the Q3 database of Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), valued at $2.5 billion.Â Here is what Artisan Value Fund has to say about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:âAmong our top Q3 contributors were Blackstone. Investment stalwart Blackstoneâs virtuous cycle is in full swing. Throughout Blackstoneâs history, excellent investment performance and capital protection have allowed the firm to increase fundraising in existing verticals as well as launch new endeavors. Historically, less than 10% of assets under management mature in any given year, and that number should move lower with continued growth in perpetual capital vehicles. Blackstoneâs A+ rated balance sheet and capital-light model are the backbone of its 85% of cash flow distribution policy via a variable quarterly dividend. In short, this is a long-duration fee stream and robust capital-raising engine.â8. Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE)Arrowstreet Capitalâs Stake Value: $238,200,000Â Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -17%Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE) is an American financial company offering global exchanges, clearing houses, mortgage technology, financial data, and listing services. Arrowstreet Capital increased its stake in Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE) by 68% in Q3 2021, holding more than 2 million shares of the company, worth $238.2 million.Â Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell on December 17 raised the price target on Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

(NYSE:ICE), with 4.1 million shares worth $474.7 million. Overall, 48 funds were bullish on the stock in Q3.Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:âIntercontinental Exchange is one of the largest and, in our view, most successful financial exchange operators in the world. The company was created through a series of shrewd acquisitions executed by their founder and CEO Jeff Sprecher. Sprecher is one of the more capable CEOs weâve evaluated, having demonstrated a long history of astute capital allocation and a willingness to act and adapt rapidly to new opportunities and competitive threats. Today, Intercontinental Exchange competes in three primary business segments: exchanges, fixed income/data services and mortgage technology. We believe each of these businesses exhibits attractive economic characteristics and that each should grow earnings well in excess of GDP over the long term. Despite this favorable long-term outlook, the company currently trades at a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the S&amp;P 500. We believe a business with Intercontinental Exchangeâs strong competitive position, excellent management team and attractive growth outlook deserves to trade well above a market multiple. We like buying great businesses at average prices and believe Intercontinental Exchange represents a compelling opportunity to do just that.â7. Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS)Arrowstreet Capitalâs Stake Value: $243,906,000Â Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -5%Arrowstreet Capital elevated its position in Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) by 190% during Q3 2021, holding a total of 1.98 million shares of the company, worth $243.9 million, representing 0.30% of the fundâs 13F securities for the period. Seaport Global analyst Bill Ryan on November 2 upgraded Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) to Buy from Neutral with a $138 price target, noting that its shares and those of most other card issuers stocks have sold off since Q3 earnings based on concerns of credit normalization, competition, and future investments.6. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Arrowstreet Capitalâs Stake Value: $349,531,000Â Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: +8%Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), an American multinational financial services corporation offering credit cards and payment systems, is one of the top finance stocks to buy according to Arrowstreet Capital. The hedge fund boosted its stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) by 347% in the third quarter, holding more than 1 million shares of the company, worth $349.5 million, representing 0.43% of the total Q3 investments.Â Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev lowered the price target on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) to $400 from $465 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on January 7. Here is what Polen Capital has to say about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:âMastercard faced pressure as some believe these âold payment infrastructureâ businesses will be disrupted by newer fintech companies using blockchain, buy now, pay later (BNPL), or other innovations to provide better/cheaper payment services. However, we believe that some of these technologies have meaningful limitations which could benefit existing payment networks. For example, BNPL transactions are often funded with cards and turn a one-time transaction into many smaller ones with more transaction fees for Mastercard. Just like with regulation, we continually monitor for competition and technological disruption. As of now, we do not see a significant risk in the foreseeable future to this company.â Click to continue reading and see Was Arrowstreet Capital Right About These 5 Finance Stocks?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 76% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Lockheed Martin. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Lockheed Martin does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lockheed Martin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Lockheed Martin is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc. with 15% of shares outstanding. With 8.7% and 6.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Lockheed Martin Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$85m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Lockheed Martin. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Lockheed Martin has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

56,e19a4503-79c2-37ba-a15b-d7d182bebe32,LMT,2022-11-28,Exclusive: 100-mile strike weapon weighed for Ukraine as arms makers wrestle with demand - sources,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-100-mile-strike-weapon-060342921.html,1669615422,STORY,"['BA', 'LMT']","[By Mike StoneWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted onto abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines as the West struggles to meet demand for more arms.U.S. and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing's proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America's Eastern European allies, industry sources said.Although the United States has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range ATACMS missile, the GLSDB's 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas.GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in U.S. inventories.Doug Bush, the U.S. Army's chief weapons buyer, told reporters at the Pentagon last week the Army was also looking at accelerating production of 155 millimeter artillery shells - currently only manufactured at government facilities - by allowing defense contractors to build them.The invasion of Ukraine drove up demand for American-made weapons and ammunition, while U.S. allies in Eastern Europe are ""putting a lot of orders,"" in for a range of arms as they supply Ukraine, Bush added.""It's about getting quantity at a cheap cost,"" said Tom Karako, a weapons and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He said falling U.S. inventories help explain the rush to get more arms now, saying stockpiles are ""getting low relative to the levels we like to keep on hand and certainly to the levels we're going to need to deter a China conflict.""Story continuesKarako also noted that the U.S. exit from Afghanistan left lots of air-dropped bombs available. They cannot be easily used with Ukrainian aircraft, but ""in today's context we should be looking for innovative ways to convert them to standoff capability.""Although a handful of GLSDB units have already been made, there are many logistical obstacles to formal procurement. The Boeing plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible. Any arrangement would also require at least six suppliers to expedite shipments of their parts and services to produce the weapon quickly.A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Tim Gorman declined to comment on providing any ""specific capability"" to Ukraine, but said the U.S. and its allies ""identify and consider the most appropriate systems"" that would help Kyiv.GLSDB is made jointly by SAAB AB and Boeing Co and has been in development since 2019, well before the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"". In October, SAAB chief executive Micael Johansson said of the GLSDB: ""We are imminently shortly expecting contracts on that.""According to the document - a Boeing proposal to U.S. European Command (EUCOM), which is overseeing weapons headed to Ukraine - the main components of the GLSDB would come from current U.S. stores.The M26 rocket motor is relatively abundant, and the GBU-39 costs about $40,000 each, making the completed GLSDB inexpensive and its main components readily available. Although arms manufacturers are struggling with demand, those factors make it possible to yield weapons by early 2023, albeit at a low rate of production.GLSDB is GPS-guided, can defeat some electronic jamming, is usable in all weather conditions, and can be used against armored vehicles, according to SAAB's website. The GBU-39 - which would function as the GLSDB's warhead - has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km if dropped from an aircraft and targets as small as 3 feet in diameter.INDUSTRY MOTIVATIONAt a production plant in rural Arkansas, Lockheed Martin is redoubling efforts to meet surging demand for mobile rocket launchers known as HIMARS, which have been successful in hitting Russian supply lines, command posts and even individual tanks. The No. 1 U.S. defense contractor is working through supply chain issues and labor shortages to double production to 96 launchers a year.Lockheed Martin has posted more than 15 jobs related to the production of HIMARS, including supply chain quality engineers, purchasing analysts, and testing engineers, according to its website.""We've made investments in terms of infrastructure in the factory where we build HIMARS,"" said Becky Withrow, a sales leader at Lockheed Martin's missile unit.Despite the increase in demand, Lockheed Martin's chief financial officer told Reuters in July that he did not expect significant Ukraine-induced revenue until 2024 or beyond. The CFO of Raytheon Corp, another major U.S. defense contractor, echoed that timeline in an interview with Reuters this summer.HIMARS fires Guided Multiple Rocket Launch System missiles (GMLRS), which are GPS-guided rounds with 200-pound (90kg) warheads. Lockheed Martin make about 4,600 of the missiles per year; more than 5,000 have been sent to Ukraine so far, according to a Reuters analysis. The U.S. has not disclosed how many GMLRS rounds have been supplied to Ukraine.Repurposing weapons for regular military use is not a new tactic. The NASAMS anti-aircraft system, developed by Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and Raytheon, uses AIM-120 missiles - originally meant to be fired from fighter jets at other aircraft. Another weapon, the Joint-Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), ubiquitous in U.S. inventories, is a standard unguided bomb that has been fitted with fins and a GPS guidance system.(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington; editing by Chris Sanders)]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for PulteGroup How Quickly Is PulteGroup Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. PulteGroup's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 47%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that PulteGroup's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue last year, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The good news is that PulteGroup is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.9 percentage points to 20%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of PulteGroup's forecast profits?Story continuesAre PulteGroup Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of PulteGroup, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. With a whopping US$70m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Does PulteGroup Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?PulteGroup's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching PulteGroup very closely. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for PulteGroup that you need to take into consideration.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider.Across the world, investors have been scrambling to find ways to strengthen their portfolios and reduce risk as stock markets become more volatile due to rising inflation and interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation. Ordinary people are also exploring possible investments in dividend stocks for their retirement portfolios. In this context, there has been a flurry of activity in safe dividend plays like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).Â It is pertinent to mention that it is not always easy to set up a retirement portfolio. A study by GOBankingRates claims that 64% of workers in the United States have less than $10,000 saved for the exit from full-time employment. Among those aged 55 and older, almost 40% have no savings at all. These figures highlight the importance that an ordinary citizen must place on a retirement portfolio. Considering the present volatility of the markets, it is prudent to invest in safe dividend stocks for such a portfolio.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with impressive yields and a consistent history of payouts stretching back over more than a decade were preferred for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Dividend Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider11. ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Â Story continuesDividend Yield as of November 28: 5.72%Â Â Â Â Â Â ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) engages in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas in the United States. It is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 24, Guidewire, a software company which supports the entire insurance life cycle for leading insurers in 38 countries, announced that it has formed a strategic partnership with ONEOK to provide digital experiences for payments that deliver agility and flexibility throughout the insurance lifecycle from quote to claim payments.Â On October 19, Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad maintained an Equal Weight rating on ONEOK, Inc.

(NYSE:OKE) with 1 million shares worth more than $52.7 million.Â Just like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement portfolio.Â In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Miller Howard Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn late August, we increased the portfolioâs cyclical exposure by trimming utilities after a period of relative outperformance and reallocating the capital to midstream energy, which had pulled back over the summer. We addedÂ ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Â with the expectation that it will benefit from increasing natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery in the Bakken region.â10. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 8.40%Â Â Â Â Â Altria Group, Inc.

(NYSE:MO), compared to 48 in the preceding quarter worth $1.8 billion.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âAltria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Â shook off the prospects of a ban on menthol and a potential cap on nicotine and gained 20%. We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are availableÂ here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the marketâs multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x â 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.â9. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 7.56%Â Â Â Â Â Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

Here is what the fund said:âOur biggest dollar gainer within this period wasÂ Devon Energy CorporationÂ (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devonâs thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what itâs like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devonâs Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathawayâs energy investments.â8. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 3.39%Â Â Â Â Â Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) with 12 million shares worth more than $742.5 million.Â In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOther pharma companies are providing solutions as well. Biopharmaceutical companyÂ Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)âs remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication administered by intravenous infusion; it can shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in non-hospitalized patients.â7.

On September 29, Molson Coors Beverage said it has expanded its exclusive agreement with The Coca-Cola Company to commercialize and develop the Topo Chico Spirited beverage.

Here is what the fund said:âOver the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.â6.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time.Â This year has been challenging for investors due to continuous interest rate hikes and an all-time high inflation. According to a recent survey conducted by Nationwideâs eighth annual Advisor Authority, only 39% of investors are optimistic about their 12-month financial outlook, and 54% of investors expect further market volatility during the same period. According to analysts, investors should focus on dividend stocks because these securities have historically performed well during previous inflationary periods.Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist of Morningstar, recently spoke to her financial services company about the importance of dividend stocks. She asserted that in six recessionary periods going back to 1980, dividend stocks outperformed the broader market in three of those periods. Similarly, Morningstarâs editorial director David Harrell also talked about the performance of dividend stocks this year with the same channel. He mentioned that dividend stocks are outperforming the broader market this year with a performance differential of 17 percentage points, which is significant. He further mentioned that even in the high-interest rate periods during the 1970s, dividend payers outperformed the broader market.When it comes to dividend stocks, investors often prefer companies that have strong histories of raising their dividends. According to Morgan Stanley, investing in companies that consistently grow their dividends can contribute to portfolio returns for the long term, especially during a turbulent market. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but is starting to fall, like the situation we are seeing today. Some of the popular dividend stocks among investors include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).Story continuesIn this article, we will further analyze the best dividend stocks of all time.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:The dividend stocks mentioned below have been paying dividends to shareholders for over 75 years.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.â14.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the companyâs combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.â12.

Here is what the firm has to say:âThird Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the companyâs Hillâs Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgateâs consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hillâs or Colgateâs ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recoverâ¦â (Click here to view the full text)7.

For more companies,Â  head on over to 5 Biggest Holding Companies in the World. A holding company is quite common in the business world, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance. They are created due to the fact that holding companies and their subsidiaries are separate entities. So if the subsidiary encounters any problems, or goes bankrupt for instance, the parent will be shielded from the subsequent liability requirements.In the financial world, there are different kinds of firms that are involved in the business of investing in other companies. Apart from holding companies, hedge funds and mutual funds also acquire an interest in firms. However, the primary difference between these and a holding company is that the former two do not acquire a controlling stake that provides them with the ability to set management and decide on the long term strategic objectives of the target firm. However, a holding company generally does acquire a controlling stake, and due to this, it is also entitled to the profits of a subsidiary. The percentage of the share in profits depends on the controlling stake and is listed after the subsidiary has accounted for all business expenses, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax payments.Holding companies also offer tax advantages, if the parent company is headquartered in a low tax rate region. Additionally, the subsidiaries can either be acquired through purchasing shares or if a larger entity decides to spin off a business unit.There are some limitations to a holding company though. For instance, a holding company cannot acquire a stake in either an S Corp or a sole proprietorship. S companies are exempt from paying taxes, and instead, their profits are routed back to the owners who then pay income taxes. Additionally, while the picture might be rosy for the parent, it comes with a myriad of risks for the subsidiary. The subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Finally, multinationals often face difficulties in transferring their profits across countries due to a lack of standardized tax rules that leads to double taxation on the profits depending on the route that the profits take from the subsidiaries to the parent.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take a look at some of the biggest holding companies in the world. Most of these are banks, but there are others as well. Renowned names include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Tandem has led the development of more automated control of insulin dosing featuring its BasalHQ and Control-IQ algorithms. The company also sells insulin reservoir cartridges and infusion sets for use with its pumps. Tandem stock underperformed after the company announced third quarter results and 2020 guidance that was somewhat weaker than expected. As a durable insulin pump company, Tandem is more tied to new patient demand, which has been suppressed due to the pandemic. There are also some competitive concerns in 2021. with two other established companies planning to launch new products. However, Tandem also has a series of new products for 2021. including its mobile bolus feature, its new t-sport pump and an enhanced version of its current Control-IQ algorithm. We believe these new products are being underappreciated by investors.â8.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the companyâs top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits.

(NYSE:MRK) shareholders have had a good week with the stock up 3.1%, they shouldn't let their guards down. In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$3.0m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Merck Merck Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; General Counsel, Jennifer Zachary, for US$1.7m worth of shares, at about US$99.85 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$108. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 30% of Jennifer Zachary's stake.Merck insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Merck Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Merck shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$3.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Merck Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Merck insiders own about US$204m worth of shares (which is 0.08% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Merck Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Merck is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Merck. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Merck you should be aware of.But note: Merck may not be the best stock to buy.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time.Â This year has been challenging for investors due to continuous interest rate hikes and an all-time high inflation. According to a recent survey conducted by Nationwideâs eighth annual Advisor Authority, only 39% of investors are optimistic about their 12-month financial outlook, and 54% of investors expect further market volatility during the same period. According to analysts, investors should focus on dividend stocks because these securities have historically performed well during previous inflationary periods.Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist of Morningstar, recently spoke to her financial services company about the importance of dividend stocks. She asserted that in six recessionary periods going back to 1980, dividend stocks outperformed the broader market in three of those periods. Similarly, Morningstarâs editorial director David Harrell also talked about the performance of dividend stocks this year with the same channel. He mentioned that dividend stocks are outperforming the broader market this year with a performance differential of 17 percentage points, which is significant. He further mentioned that even in the high-interest rate periods during the 1970s, dividend payers outperformed the broader market.When it comes to dividend stocks, investors often prefer companies that have strong histories of raising their dividends. According to Morgan Stanley, investing in companies that consistently grow their dividends can contribute to portfolio returns for the long term, especially during a turbulent market. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but is starting to fall, like the situation we are seeing today. Some of the popular dividend stocks among investors include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).Story continuesIn this article, we will further analyze the best dividend stocks of all time.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:The dividend stocks mentioned below have been paying dividends to shareholders for over 75 years. We analyzed these companies through their balance sheets and overall financial health to determine their dividend stability. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields, as of November 25.15. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Dividend Yield as of November 25: 1.07%Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company that has operations in 18 countries around the world and sells its products in over 125 countries. In November, Berenberg raised its price target on the stock to $375 with a Buy rating on the shares, appreciating the company's strong underlying performance despite the current market situation.In Q3 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) reported revenue of $6.94 billion, which showed a 2.5% growth from the same period last year. The company expects its revenue to fall between $28.5 billion to $29 billion in FY22. Moreover, it expects to spend between $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion on Research and Development.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been making consistent dividend payments since 1885 and has raised its payouts for eight consecutive years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share for a dividend yield of 1.07%, as of November 25. Its long dividend streak makes it a good investment option alongside other dividend stocks like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).As of the close of Q3 2022, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), growing from 70 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $5.4 billion. With nearly 4 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder.ClearBridge Investments mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:âIn the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimerâs disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.â14. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Dividend Yield as of November 25: 1.33%Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a New Jersey-based manufacturer of household, healthcare, and global consumer products.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the companyâs combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.â12.

Here is what the firm has to say:âThird Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the companyâs Hillâs Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgateâs consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hillâs or Colgateâs ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recoverâ¦â (Click here to view the full text)7.

67,bfdda7ac-c3cc-3cf5-90a3-1c86cf6bf569,BA,2022-11-28,The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 50% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-company-nyse-ba-favoured-120049062.html,1669636849,STORY,['BA'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 50% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Boeing, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Boeing does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Boeing's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthBoeing is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of BoeingThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Boeing Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$79m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 43% stake in Boeing. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Boeing is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

68,e19a4503-79c2-37ba-a15b-d7d182bebe32,BA,2022-11-28,Exclusive: 100-mile strike weapon weighed for Ukraine as arms makers wrestle with demand - sources,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-100-mile-strike-weapon-060342921.html,1669615422,STORY,"['BA', 'LMT']","[By Mike StoneWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted onto abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines as the West struggles to meet demand for more arms.U.S. and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing's proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America's Eastern European allies, industry sources said.Although the United States has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range ATACMS missile, the GLSDB's 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas.GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in U.S. inventories.Doug Bush, the U.S. Army's chief weapons buyer, told reporters at the Pentagon last week the Army was also looking at accelerating production of 155 millimeter artillery shells - currently only manufactured at government facilities - by allowing defense contractors to build them.The invasion of Ukraine drove up demand for American-made weapons and ammunition, while U.S. allies in Eastern Europe are ""putting a lot of orders,"" in for a range of arms as they supply Ukraine, Bush added.""It's about getting quantity at a cheap cost,"" said Tom Karako, a weapons and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He said falling U.S. inventories help explain the rush to get more arms now, saying stockpiles are ""getting low relative to the levels we like to keep on hand and certainly to the levels we're going to need to deter a China conflict.""Story continuesKarako also noted that the U.S. exit from Afghanistan left lots of air-dropped bombs available. They cannot be easily used with Ukrainian aircraft, but ""in today's context we should be looking for innovative ways to convert them to standoff capability.""Although a handful of GLSDB units have already been made, there are many logistical obstacles to formal procurement. The Boeing plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible. Any arrangement would also require at least six suppliers to expedite shipments of their parts and services to produce the weapon quickly.A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Tim Gorman declined to comment on providing any ""specific capability"" to Ukraine, but said the U.S. and its allies ""identify and consider the most appropriate systems"" that would help Kyiv.GLSDB is made jointly by SAAB AB and Boeing Co and has been in development since 2019, well before the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"". In October, SAAB chief executive Micael Johansson said of the GLSDB: ""We are imminently shortly expecting contracts on that.""According to the document - a Boeing proposal to U.S. European Command (EUCOM), which is overseeing weapons headed to Ukraine - the main components of the GLSDB would come from current U.S. stores.The M26 rocket motor is relatively abundant, and the GBU-39 costs about $40,000 each, making the completed GLSDB inexpensive and its main components readily available. Although arms manufacturers are struggling with demand, those factors make it possible to yield weapons by early 2023, albeit at a low rate of production.GLSDB is GPS-guided, can defeat some electronic jamming, is usable in all weather conditions, and can be used against armored vehicles, according to SAAB's website. The GBU-39 - which would function as the GLSDB's warhead - has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km if dropped from an aircraft and targets as small as 3 feet in diameter.INDUSTRY MOTIVATIONAt a production plant in rural Arkansas, Lockheed Martin is redoubling efforts to meet surging demand for mobile rocket launchers known as HIMARS, which have been successful in hitting Russian supply lines, command posts and even individual tanks. The No. 1 U.S. defense contractor is working through supply chain issues and labor shortages to double production to 96 launchers a year.Lockheed Martin has posted more than 15 jobs related to the production of HIMARS, including supply chain quality engineers, purchasing analysts, and testing engineers, according to its website.""We've made investments in terms of infrastructure in the factory where we build HIMARS,"" said Becky Withrow, a sales leader at Lockheed Martin's missile unit.Despite the increase in demand, Lockheed Martin's chief financial officer told Reuters in July that he did not expect significant Ukraine-induced revenue until 2024 or beyond. The CFO of Raytheon Corp, another major U.S. defense contractor, echoed that timeline in an interview with Reuters this summer.HIMARS fires Guided Multiple Rocket Launch System missiles (GMLRS), which are GPS-guided rounds with 200-pound (90kg) warheads. Lockheed Martin make about 4,600 of the missiles per year; more than 5,000 have been sent to Ukraine so far, according to a Reuters analysis. The U.S. has not disclosed how many GMLRS rounds have been supplied to Ukraine.Repurposing weapons for regular military use is not a new tactic. The NASAMS anti-aircraft system, developed by Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and Raytheon, uses AIM-120 missiles - originally meant to be fired from fighter jets at other aircraft.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 63% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Southern, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Southern?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Southern. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Southern's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Southern. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 6.0% of the company stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SouthernThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Southern Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$168m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Southern better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Southern has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

72,84f23574-1c0b-36ab-9a2b-b33c1d1ab23d,NOC,2022-11-28,Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 85% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-corporation-nyse-noc-130119896.html,1669640479,STORY,['NOC'],"[A look at the shareholders of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Northrop Grumman. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Northrop Grumman?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Northrop Grumman does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Northrop Grumman's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Northrop Grumman. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.3% and 7.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Northrop GrummanThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Northrop Grumman Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$148m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Northrop Grumman. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Northrop Grumman  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

For more companies,Â  head on over to 5 Biggest Holding Companies in the World. A holding company is quite common in the business world, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance. They are created due to the fact that holding companies and their subsidiaries are separate entities. So if the subsidiary encounters any problems, or goes bankrupt for instance, the parent will be shielded from the subsequent liability requirements.In the financial world, there are different kinds of firms that are involved in the business of investing in other companies. Apart from holding companies, hedge funds and mutual funds also acquire an interest in firms. However, the primary difference between these and a holding company is that the former two do not acquire a controlling stake that provides them with the ability to set management and decide on the long term strategic objectives of the target firm. However, a holding company generally does acquire a controlling stake, and due to this, it is also entitled to the profits of a subsidiary. The percentage of the share in profits depends on the controlling stake and is listed after the subsidiary has accounted for all business expenses, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax payments.Holding companies also offer tax advantages, if the parent company is headquartered in a low tax rate region. Additionally, the subsidiaries can either be acquired through purchasing shares or if a larger entity decides to spin off a business unit.There are some limitations to a holding company though. For instance, a holding company cannot acquire a stake in either an S Corp or a sole proprietorship. S companies are exempt from paying taxes, and instead, their profits are routed back to the owners who then pay income taxes. Additionally, while the picture might be rosy for the parent, it comes with a myriad of risks for the subsidiary. The subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Finally, multinationals often face difficulties in transferring their profits across countries due to a lack of standardized tax rules that leads to double taxation on the profits depending on the route that the profits take from the subsidiaries to the parent.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take a look at some of the biggest holding companies in the world. Most of these are banks, but there are others as well. Renowned names include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

However, a holding company generally does acquire a controlling stake, and due to this, it is also entitled to the profits of a subsidiary. The percentage of the share in profits depends on the controlling stake and is listed after the subsidiary has accounted for all business expenses, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax payments.Holding companies also offer tax advantages, if the parent company is headquartered in a low tax rate region. Additionally, the subsidiaries can either be acquired through purchasing shares or if a larger entity decides to spin off a business unit.There are some limitations to a holding company though. For instance, a holding company cannot acquire a stake in either an S Corp or a sole proprietorship. S companies are exempt from paying taxes, and instead, their profits are routed back to the owners who then pay income taxes. Additionally, while the picture might be rosy for the parent, it comes with a myriad of risks for the subsidiary. The subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Finally, multinationals often face difficulties in transferring their profits across countries due to a lack of standardized tax rules that leads to double taxation on the profits depending on the route that the profits take from the subsidiaries to the parent.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take a look at some of the biggest holding companies in the world. Most of these are banks, but there are others as well. Renowned names include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.So I'm watching the Macy's (M) Thanksgiving Day Parade and was pleasantly surprised to see musical performances by icons Paula Abdul and Mariah Carey on the docket.They both crushed it in my view, and so did Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette sitting behind them in a seasonal bright blue scarf and CEO hair.Then I see that the parade had 27.7 million viewers between linear and streaming platform Peacock â the most in five years and a slight bump from last year's 27.4 million views.Hoda Kotb and Jeff Gennette at the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Photo by: Cara Howe/NBC via Getty Images)Those two wins were enough for me to dive back into Macy's fundamentals for this year.To be clear, I've been super critical of this company for years.Management was painfully slow to close stores. The stores that were opened looked terrible. You couldn't find associates in the store to ask basic questions (for example: Where is the fitting room?). There was too much inventory in the stores. The website was awful, ditto the mobile app. The company was often more inclined to over-promise and badly under-deliver on earnings.However, the winds of positive change appear to have been blowing through Macy's this year, which is even more impressive considering the shifts happening in consumer spending â paying up for experiences and buying less stuff â amid the sluggish economy.Here are a few things that stand out on Macy's fundamentally on this Cyber Monday:The stock has pretty much out-performed the S&amp;P 500 for the majority of 2022. No small feat given the hate for consumer discretionary stocks with recession fears swirling.Inventory levels are some of the healthiest among rival department stores, reflecting management efforts to fine-tune assortment planning.Same-store sales are out-performing rival department stores such as Kohl's.Bloomingdale's is having a good year despite higher income shoppers pulling back on their spending amid stock market wealth destruction.Story continuesI am not alone in spotting a revival in Macy's fortunes.""Think about what has happened over the last three years,"" former department store executive and frequent Yahoo Finance Live guest Jan Rogers Kniffen told me.""First, J.C. Penney completely imploded and reconstituted itself as a much smaller competitor â and the bottom 40% of Macy's business always overlapped JCP's business. Kohl's, which also overlaps the bottom 40% of Macy's business, slowed a lot as a competitor â it lost share, dropped volume and became less competitive. Then, Nordstrom, which has always overlapped the top 25% of Macy's business and more like 50% in some of Macy's best stores, started shooting itself in the foot.""Kniffen also agreed in Macy's doing a better job managing inventory and getting store expenses under wraps.Mariah Carey at the 2022 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (Photo by: Cara Howe/NBC via Getty Images)By no means is Macy's in perfect fundamental shape, something captured in the stock trading at a 65% discount to the S&amp;P 500 on a forward P/E basis. Same-store sales are still under pressure, and the retailer still operates 770 plus physical stores in the age of digital. The short-term margin outlook is murky at best given the promotional intensity in retail right now. The company just cut its 4Q guidance two weeks ago too, owing to a slow start to holiday spending this month.But I must give Macy's credit where credit is due â they are operating a better department store and it's starting to show up in the financials.

With 73% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$2.4b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 8.9% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CSX. See our latest analysis for CSX ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CSX?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in CSX. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see CSX's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in CSX. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.4% by the third-largest shareholder.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of CSXThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of CSX Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$58m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in CSX. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand CSX better, we need to consider many other factors.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global jewelry industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Jewelry Companies in the World.Â Market InsightsThe global jewelry market is valued at $249 billion as of 2021 and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 8.5% from 2022 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. As far as materials go, the industry is dominated by gold, silver, platinum and diamond. Gold held the highest revenue share, at 40%, and is projected to maintain its dominant position in the forecast period.Â In terms of product, ring dominates the market with the highest revenue share at 25%. The demand for rings is primarily driven by weddings. It is the most popular wedding jewelry item across many cultures around the world. It is followed by the demand in bracelets, which has a projected CAGR of 8.9% for the period 2022-2030.Â Another important insight from the report shows that Asia-Pacific holds the greatest share of the jewelry market, at a whopping 60%. It can be attributed to the growth in the size of the middle class in countries like China and India, that have a collective population of 2.8 billion.Insofar as the US is concerned, its jewelry market added $47 billion to the global jewelry market in 2021. It grew 27% from 2020, which had seen a 13.4% decline from 2019, presumably due to the onset of the pandemic and the following supply chain disruptions and lockdowns.Â The growth in jewelry market in the US apparently fell in 2022 but that can be interpreted as normal given the pandemic correction in 2021 due to delayed events like weddings. The demand is steadily growing in the US due to falling gold and silver prices, and rising GDP per capita.Â While the pandemic hurt the industry, it was not all bad. A survey conducted by The Plumb Club showed a net 9% respondents saying their jewelry shopping rose amid the pandemic.Â Cultural RoleJewelry is a prominent aspect of many cultures, especially in Asia-Pacific.

Further, wearing jewelry is often associated with certain Hindu religious traditions. StarLuxe, Nemichand Bemalwa &amp; Sons, M&amp;B private jewelers, Titan Company, and Chow Tai Fook are some of the top companies in the Asia-Pacific region.Story continuesAnother factor in global jewelry market growth is that men, especially in the western world, have also been increasingly buying more jewelry compared to the past as gender roles lose their grip on society.Â  According to Euromonitor International, menâs jewelry market size is worth $6.5 billion within the larger market as of 2021, indicating a 17% growth from 2020.LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, SociÃ©tÃ© EuropÃ©enne (PARIS:MC.PA) and Chanel are some of the most prominent companies in Europe and North America.Â Other than physical stores, their products can be conveniently purchased online via Amazon.com, Inc.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Verizon CommunicationsThe , Tamara Erwin, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$39.02. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Verizon Communications insiders own about US$29m worth of shares. That equates to 0.02% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Do The Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Verizon Communications shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Verizon Communications insiders. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

If you want to read about some more tech stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks to Consider.There is broad-based consensus among finance professionals that the traditional definitions of growth and value stocks do hold-up very well in the present economy. This is because the technology sector has disrupted almost every major industry and is now a critical part of the overall economy, and firms like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are now established businesses with strong profiles that are not, in the ordinary sense of the word, exclusively growth-oriented.There are examples which illustrate this point. Peter Thiel, a famous entrepreneur, grew a $1,700 investment in tech stocks to a multi-billion dollar tax-free payout over the course of two decades. During the pandemic, the shift towards digital also demonstrated the safety of tech stocks as businesses altered their models to incorporate the changing consumer demands. Investors are now discarding value sectors like utilities and consumer goods in favor of tech-led disruptors for better returns in the long-term.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the technology sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Tech Stocks to Consider11. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Â Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) a biotech company that discovers, develops, and commercializes medicines. It is one of the best safe tech stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 31, Maxim analyst Jason McCarthy maintained a Buy rating on Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock and raised the price target to $92 from $84, noting that the company's third quarter results were strong due to the Veklury and HIV franchise. Â Story continuesAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrow Street Capital is a leading shareholder in Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) with 12 million shares worth more than $742.5 million.Â Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is one of the safe tech stocks for a retirement portfolio.Â In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOther pharma companies are providing solutions as well. Biopharmaceutical companyÂ Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)âs remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication administered by intravenous infusion; it can shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in non-hospitalized patients.â10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Â  Â Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. It is one of the top safe tech stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 4, Micron Technology said that it would spend $100 billion on a massive new chip making facility in upstate New York in another sign that new federal investments are stimulating domestic investment in the semiconductor industry.On October 13, Loop Capital analyst Charles Park initiated coverage of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock with a Buy rating and $70 price target, noting that the key metrics show that the memory industry is nearing a bottom and the risk/reward appears favorable.Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âMicron Technology, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micronâs stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.â9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Â  Â Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. It is one of the premier safe tech stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 3, Teslaâs CEO Elon Musk said he planned to triple the size of its factory in southeast Berlin. Tesla required 1.4 million cubic meters of water every year to cast vehicle parts and cool heavy machinery and painting jobs. It has now gained access to a water resource for the purpose.Â On October 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained an Overweight rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $330 from $350, noting that the company's third quarter report, while in line with consensus expectations, was both stronger and higher quality than expected.Â Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion.Â Â In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn 2014, before we began to invest inÂ TeslaÂ (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Muskâs electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Teslaâs prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motorsâ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read moreâ¦)8.

New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforceâs strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next yearâs revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.âÂ Click to continue reading and see Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks to Consider.Â Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time.Â This year has been challenging for investors due to continuous interest rate hikes and an all-time high inflation. According to a recent survey conducted by Nationwideâs eighth annual Advisor Authority, only 39% of investors are optimistic about their 12-month financial outlook, and 54% of investors expect further market volatility during the same period. According to analysts, investors should focus on dividend stocks because these securities have historically performed well during previous inflationary periods.Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist of Morningstar, recently spoke to her financial services company about the importance of dividend stocks. She asserted that in six recessionary periods going back to 1980, dividend stocks outperformed the broader market in three of those periods. Similarly, Morningstarâs editorial director David Harrell also talked about the performance of dividend stocks this year with the same channel. He mentioned that dividend stocks are outperforming the broader market this year with a performance differential of 17 percentage points, which is significant. He further mentioned that even in the high-interest rate periods during the 1970s, dividend payers outperformed the broader market.When it comes to dividend stocks, investors often prefer companies that have strong histories of raising their dividends. According to Morgan Stanley, investing in companies that consistently grow their dividends can contribute to portfolio returns for the long term, especially during a turbulent market. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but is starting to fall, like the situation we are seeing today. Some of the popular dividend stocks among investors include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.â14.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the companyâs combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.â12.

Here is what the firm has to say:âThird Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the companyâs Hillâs Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgateâs consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hillâs or Colgateâs ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recoverâ¦â (Click here to view the full text)7.

Disneyâs share price has collapsed over the last few months as spending at Disney+ offset the recovery in the parks and experiences division.The chart below shows the share price performance under Bob Iger and then Bob Chapek, along with the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index. Itâs easy to see why bringing Iger back should restore investor confidence.NYSE: DIS Share Price vs S&amp;P500 2002 to 2022 Image Credit: Tradingview.comOur take:  This is probably a good move for now. However, it also suggests the board views Disneyâs recent performance as very concerning. As we recently pointed out, the  current valuation assumes a lot will go right in the next year. Cutting costs without losing revenue won't be easy, and investors may need to be patient and tolerate some more volatility.See our latest analysis for Walt DisneyZoom still needs to prove new investments will pay offThere wasnât much to be excited about when Zoom Video Communications ( Nasdaq: ZM ) released third-quarter results last week. Yes, normalized EPS were well ahead of consensus estimates, but those estimates have been revised sharply lower over the course of the year. GAAP EPS were in line, but a lot lower than the normalized figures.There were also two particularly concerning aspects to the results:Operating expenses were up 56.4% from a year ago, while revenue rose just 6.6%. Most of this increase was made up of selling, general and admin expenses which rose 46% . In other words, Zoom is spending a lot to achieve very modest sales growth.Stock-based compensation increased by 156%. The share price is now ~80% below its all-time high which means most employee stock options are likely a long way from their strike prices. The company has therefore had to issue new options to retain key talent. This may be necessary, but it ultimately costs shareholders.Story continuesOn the positive side, the company is seeing demand for its new products, Zoom Phone, and Zoom Rooms. Zoom now has 64 customers with more than 10,000 people using Zoom Phone. The company is facing increased competition from Microsoft and Alphabet, and differentiating itself with new products will be key to revenue growth in the future.Our take: Zoom isnât a âone-hit wonderâ that got lucky with the pandemic, as some may assume. The company executed incredibly well (and profitably too) prior to 2020, by building a product that stood out amongst other video conferencing tools. But the competition has caught up and Zoom is having to reinvent itself with an evolving portfolio of tools.Right now it's going through an investment phase, which will hopefully result in renewed profit growth down the line. The chart below illustrates the gap between EPS and cash flows, which are still reasonable. Hopefully, the EPS line turns up, rather than the cash flow line turning down. Until there is some resolution on this the stock price is likely to remain under pressure, but still deserves a place on watchlists.Manchester United is in playShares of Manchester United ( NYSE: MANU ) rallied 62% last week after the majority owners, the Glazer family, indicated that they were open to selling the club . After the rally in the share price, the company has a market value of just under $3.5 bln. The Glazer family had previously said they would only sell for over $7 bln, but now appear to be open to more realistic offers.One report suggested Apple may want to buy the club, although this has also been denied according to MacRumours. More likely potential buyers are billionaire Jim Ratcliffe , and consortiums including the likes ofÂ  Jim OâNeil and David Beckham.Our take: The Simply Wall St dashboard for Manchester United paints a gloomy picture of the business. Margins are negative (though cash flow is positive), debt is around four times equity and thereâs little reason to expect growth anytime soon.The real value here is the brand which could have strategic value for another company. More often though, sports clubs are bought by billionaires and not exclusively for their economic value. With egos and intangible assets involved, a deal could occur at a much higher price than makes economic sense. However, if there was a buyer prepared to pay more than $7 bln, the deal would probably have already happened.The risk for minority investors is that the Glazers end up holding out for an unrealistic price, leaving the shareâs risk skewed to the downside.Have feedback on this article?

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney Is Walt Disney Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.34bUS$8.33bUS$10.7bUS$14.2bUS$16.1bUS$17.5bUS$18.7bUS$19.7bUS$20.5bUS$21.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 8.66%Est @ 6.66%Est @ 5.25%Est @ 4.27%Est @ 3.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$5.0kUS$7.2kUS$8.6kUS$10.6kUS$11.2kUS$11.3kUS$11.3kUS$11.0kUS$10.7kUS$10.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$97bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$21bÃ (1 + 2.0%) Ã· (7.5%â 2.0%) = US$391bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$391bÃ· ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$190bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$287b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$98.9, the company appears quite good value at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.079. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider.Across the world, investors have been scrambling to find ways to strengthen their portfolios and reduce risk as stock markets become more volatile due to rising inflation and interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation. Ordinary people are also exploring possible investments in dividend stocks for their retirement portfolios. In this context, there has been a flurry of activity in safe dividend plays like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).Â It is pertinent to mention that it is not always easy to set up a retirement portfolio. A study by GOBankingRates claims that 64% of workers in the United States have less than $10,000 saved for the exit from full-time employment. Among those aged 55 and older, almost 40% have no savings at all. These figures highlight the importance that an ordinary citizen must place on a retirement portfolio. Considering the present volatility of the markets, it is prudent to invest in safe dividend stocks for such a portfolio.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with impressive yields and a consistent history of payouts stretching back over more than a decade were preferred for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Dividend Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider11. ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Â Story continuesDividend Yield as of November 28: 5.72%Â Â Â Â Â Â ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) engages in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas in the United States. It is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 24, Guidewire, a software company which supports the entire insurance life cycle for leading insurers in 38 countries, announced that it has formed a strategic partnership with ONEOK to provide digital experiences for payments that deliver agility and flexibility throughout the insurance lifecycle from quote to claim payments.Â On October 19, Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad maintained an Equal Weight rating on ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $74, noting that fewer significant profit beats are predicted than in the second quarter.Â Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) with 1 million shares worth more than $52.7 million.Â Just like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement portfolio.Â In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Miller Howard Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn late August, we increased the portfolioâs cyclical exposure by trimming utilities after a period of relative outperformance and reallocating the capital to midstream energy, which had pulled back over the summer. We addedÂ ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Â with the expectation that it will benefit from increasing natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery in the Bakken region.â10. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 8.40%Â Â Â Â Â Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. It is one of the top dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 27, Altria Group revealed a strategic alliance with Japan tobacco, a leading international tobacco product manufacturer, with a global pursuit of a global smoke-free partnership to accelerate harm reduction.Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 47 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), compared to 48 in the preceding quarter worth $1.8 billion.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âAltria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Â shook off the prospects of a ban on menthol and a potential cap on nicotine and gained 20%. We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are availableÂ here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the marketâs multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x â 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.â9. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 7.56%Â Â Â Â Â Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. It is one of the premier dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 1, Devon Energy Corp posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $2.18, beating market estimates by $0.05. The revenue over the period was $5.43 billion, up 56.5% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating market estimates by $640 million.Â Â On October 21, investment advisory Citi maintained a Buy rating on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) stock and raised the price target to $80 from $77. Analyst Scott Gruber issued the ratings update.Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 51 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), compared to 57 in the previous quarter worth $1.5 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOur biggest dollar gainer within this period wasÂ Devon Energy CorporationÂ (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devonâs thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what itâs like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devonâs Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathawayâs energy investments.â8. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 3.39%Â Â Â Â Â Gilead Sciences, Inc.

On November 2, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the expanded use of Vemlidy of Gilead Sciences to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients of 12 years age and older with compensated liver disease.Â On October 31, Maxim analyst Jason McCarthy maintained a Buy rating on Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock and raised the price target to $92 from $84, noting that the company's third quarter results were strong due to the Veklury and HIV franchise. Â Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrow Street Capital is a leading shareholder in Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) with 12 million shares worth more than $742.5 million.Â In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOther pharma companies are providing solutions as well. Biopharmaceutical companyÂ Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)âs remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication administered by intravenous infusion; it can shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in non-hospitalized patients.â7.

Here is what the fund said:âOver the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.â6. Loweâs Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 2.00%Â Â Â Â Â Loweâs Companies, Inc.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today released a new State of the Internet report that indicates a growing risk to the financial services sector and a shift to more sophisticated techniques. Web application and API attacks in particular are increasing at an alarming rate while also growing in complexity. The new report, Enemy at the Gates, further notes that roughly 80 percent of cyberattackers aim their efforts at customers of financial services in an attempt to find paths of least resistance for monetary gain.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)Enemy at the Gates shows that financial services is among the most attacked verticals in several critical areas: web application and API attacks, DDoS, phishing, zero day exploitation and botnet activities. Most concerning is the staggering surge in web application and API attacks â a 257 percent growth in the number of attacks against financial services year over year.Other key findings of the report include:Within 24 hours, exploitation of newly discovered zero days against financial services reaches multiple thousands of attacks per hour and peaks quickly - affording little time to patch and react.DDoS attacks against financial services are up 22 percent year over year.A significant increase in Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks demonstrate how attackers are shifting toward remote code execution attempts that present a larger strain on internal network security.Phishing campaigns against financial services customers are introducing techniques that bypass two-factor authentication solutions and increase risk for everyday customers.Customer account takeover attempts represent over 40 percent of attack types with another 40 percent focusing on website scraping, which is used to create more convincing phishing scams.Story continuesRegional TrendsEnemy at the GatesÂ offers a look at the regional trends most impacting financial services. Findings include:Web application and API attacks in the Asia-Pacific and Japan region grew by 449 percent. This coincides with an increasing number of cyberattacks in the region, primarily resulting in ransomware. The growing number of attacks and increased sophistication coincides with findings which connect web app and API attacks with ransomware. Australia, Japan and India are the countries with the highest number of web application and API attacks in the region.DDoS attacks against financial services in Europe increased by 73 percent in 2022. This marks a shift of attacks between regions with EMEA taking the lead in the number of these types of attacks. This is interesting to note since the United States is usually the highest in this category. One possible factor impacting this change is the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The increase in DDoS attacks in Europe might be retaliation against those who support Ukraine â an example of geopolitics spilling into cyberspace.Digitization and limited cybercrime governance could be factors that contribute toÂ  growing cybercriminal activities in Latin America.The region has seen a 419 percent increase in web application and API-related attacks over the past year. Cybercrime costs the region US$90 billion annually and prominent threats include cryptojacking, fraud, banking trojans and ransomware.""Financial services is one of the most attacked industries when new vulnerabilities are discovered, a favorite target of DDoS attacks and continuously focused on by phishing campaigns, which are aimed at their customers who suffer the brunt of these attacks,"" said Steve Winterfeld, Advisory CISO for Akamai. ""Attackers will always find ways to infiltrate your network or impact your customers. Understanding attack surfaces could provide insights into key risks and therefore allow organizations to devise security controls and mitigation plans to better protect customers.""For additional information, the security community can access, engage with, and learn from Akamai's threat researchers by visiting the new Akamai Security HubÂ and following the team on Twitter at @Akamai_Research.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time.Â This year has been challenging for investors due to continuous interest rate hikes and an all-time high inflation. According to a recent survey conducted by Nationwideâs eighth annual Advisor Authority, only 39% of investors are optimistic about their 12-month financial outlook, and 54% of investors expect further market volatility during the same period. According to analysts, investors should focus on dividend stocks because these securities have historically performed well during previous inflationary periods.Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist of Morningstar, recently spoke to her financial services company about the importance of dividend stocks. She asserted that in six recessionary periods going back to 1980, dividend stocks outperformed the broader market in three of those periods. Similarly, Morningstarâs editorial director David Harrell also talked about the performance of dividend stocks this year with the same channel. He mentioned that dividend stocks are outperforming the broader market this year with a performance differential of 17 percentage points, which is significant. He further mentioned that even in the high-interest rate periods during the 1970s, dividend payers outperformed the broader market.When it comes to dividend stocks, investors often prefer companies that have strong histories of raising their dividends. According to Morgan Stanley, investing in companies that consistently grow their dividends can contribute to portfolio returns for the long term, especially during a turbulent market. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks are at their best when inflation is above normal levels but is starting to fall, like the situation we are seeing today. Some of the popular dividend stocks among investors include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).Story continuesIn this article, we will further analyze the best dividend stocks of all time.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:The dividend stocks mentioned below have been paying dividends to shareholders for over 75 years.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.â14.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the companyâs combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.â12.

Here is what the firm has to say:âThird Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the companyâs Hillâs Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgateâs consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hillâs or Colgateâs ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recoverâ¦â (Click here to view the full text)7.

For more companies,Â  head on over to 5 Biggest Holding Companies in the World. A holding company is quite common in the business world, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance. They are created due to the fact that holding companies and their subsidiaries are separate entities. So if the subsidiary encounters any problems, or goes bankrupt for instance, the parent will be shielded from the subsequent liability requirements.In the financial world, there are different kinds of firms that are involved in the business of investing in other companies. Apart from holding companies, hedge funds and mutual funds also acquire an interest in firms. However, the primary difference between these and a holding company is that the former two do not acquire a controlling stake that provides them with the ability to set management and decide on the long term strategic objectives of the target firm. However, a holding company generally does acquire a controlling stake, and due to this, it is also entitled to the profits of a subsidiary. The percentage of the share in profits depends on the controlling stake and is listed after the subsidiary has accounted for all business expenses, cost of goods sold, interest, and tax payments.Holding companies also offer tax advantages, if the parent company is headquartered in a low tax rate region. Additionally, the subsidiaries can either be acquired through purchasing shares or if a larger entity decides to spin off a business unit.There are some limitations to a holding company though. For instance, a holding company cannot acquire a stake in either an S Corp or a sole proprietorship. S companies are exempt from paying taxes, and instead, their profits are routed back to the owners who then pay income taxes. Additionally, while the picture might be rosy for the parent, it comes with a myriad of risks for the subsidiary. The subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Finally, multinationals often face difficulties in transferring their profits across countries due to a lack of standardized tax rules that leads to double taxation on the profits depending on the route that the profits take from the subsidiaries to the parent.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take a look at some of the biggest holding companies in the world. Most of these are banks, but there are others as well. Renowned names include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).Source: PixaBayOur Methodology We studied several different industries to see which major players are structured as holding companies.

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider.Across the world, investors have been scrambling to find ways to strengthen their portfolios and reduce risk as stock markets become more volatile due to rising inflation and interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation. Ordinary people are also exploring possible investments in dividend stocks for their retirement portfolios. In this context, there has been a flurry of activity in safe dividend plays like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).Â It is pertinent to mention that it is not always easy to set up a retirement portfolio. A study by GOBankingRates claims that 64% of workers in the United States have less than $10,000 saved for the exit from full-time employment. Among those aged 55 and older, almost 40% have no savings at all. These figures highlight the importance that an ordinary citizen must place on a retirement portfolio. Considering the present volatility of the markets, it is prudent to invest in safe dividend stocks for such a portfolio.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with impressive yields and a consistent history of payouts stretching back over more than a decade were preferred for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Dividend Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider11.

(NYSE:OKE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn late August, we increased the portfolioâs cyclical exposure by trimming utilities after a period of relative outperformance and reallocating the capital to midstream energy, which had pulled back over the summer. We addedÂ ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Â with the expectation that it will benefit from increasing natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery in the Bakken region.â10. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 8.40%Â Â Â Â Â Altria Group, Inc.

We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are availableÂ here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the marketâs multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x â 20x (+/-1 standard deviation).

Here is what the fund said:âOur biggest dollar gainer within this period wasÂ Devon Energy CorporationÂ (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devonâs thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what itâs like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devonâs Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathawayâs energy investments.â8. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 3.39%Â Â Â Â Â Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:âOver the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.â6.

If you want to read about some more tech stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Tech Stocks to Consider.There is broad-based consensus among finance professionals that the traditional definitions of growth and value stocks do hold-up very well in the present economy. This is because the technology sector has disrupted almost every major industry and is now a critical part of the overall economy, and firms like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are now established businesses with strong profiles that are not, in the ordinary sense of the word, exclusively growth-oriented.There are examples which illustrate this point. Peter Thiel, a famous entrepreneur, grew a $1,700 investment in tech stocks to a multi-billion dollar tax-free payout over the course of two decades. During the pandemic, the shift towards digital also demonstrated the safety of tech stocks as businesses altered their models to incorporate the changing consumer demands. Investors are now discarding value sectors like utilities and consumer goods in favor of tech-led disruptors for better returns in the long-term.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the technology sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

(NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âMicron Technology, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micronâs stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.â9.

(NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion.Â Â In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn 2014, before we began to invest inÂ TeslaÂ (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Muskâs electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Teslaâs prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motorsâ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read moreâ¦)8.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Most Valuable Bootstrapped Companies In The World. The allure of making it big in the business world, disrupting industries, and making millions is what drives entrepreneurs to take risks and set up new firms. Setting up a new company is perhaps among the most difficult tasks in the world, as it requires a multi-year commitment and solving new challenges almost every day. However, the returns of this struggle are exponential in many cases.A key challenge when setting up a new firm is finding capital. There are a couple of ways in which founders can secure funding, and these include seeking the aid of outside professional investors or relying on their own capital or that of close friends and family. The latter is called bootstrapping, and it has its caveats and benefits since while raising capital from outside sources requires ceding control, using your own money to finance a startup carries the risk of a complete loss of savings and other funds.An example of the toll that the latter takes on a founder is the SpaceX billionaire Mr. Elon Musk. During the 2008 financial crisis, and when his company suffered its first three rocket launch failures, Mr. Musk would reportedly wake up screaming at night after experiencing nightmares. At the time, the executive had invested all his money into Tesla and SpaceX, and as both failed to turn a profit or execute successfully, his mental health paid the price alongside his bank account.Fast forward to the current day, and SpaceX is one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world. Alongside the rocket company that is the darling of the aerospace world and the public sector these days, some other top firms that were bootstrapped initially but then made it big are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Story continuesOur Methodology We took a broad look at the business world to sift out the biggest names right now.

118,d7577147-80d1-3c28-ac4c-267383b749a7,NI,2022-11-28,What NiSource Inc.'s (NYSE:NI) ROE Can Tell Us,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nisource-inc-nyse-ni-roe-104747324.html,1669632467,STORY,"['NI', 'NIMC']","[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for NiSource How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) Ã· Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NiSource is:9.6% = US$724m Ã· US$7.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.10 in profit.Does NiSource Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see NiSource has a similar ROE to the average in the Integrated Utilities industry classification (9.0%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 3 risks we have identified for NiSource visit our risks dashboard for free.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining NiSource's Debt And Its 9.6% Return On EquityNiSource does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.44. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: NiSource may not be the best stock to buy.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders disposed of US$11m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-mondelez-international-110037118.html,1669633237,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Many Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Mondelez InternationalIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Fredric Reynolds, sold US$5.7m worth of shares at a price of US$63.29 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$66.69, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was 69% of Fredric Reynolds's holding.Insiders in Mondelez International didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Mondelez International insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$105m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Mondelez International Insiders?The fact that there have been no Mondelez International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Mondelez International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, Mondelez International has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about.Of course Mondelez International may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The findings, which included a high procedural success rate of 98.4% and low rates of mortality and paravalvular leak (PVL), were presented during a late-breaking clinical trial session at PCR London Valves 2022 and published simultaneously in EuroIntervention.ACURATE neo2â¢ Aortic Valve System.In this European study, the primary safety endpoint of all-cause mortality was 0.8% at 30 days. The data also demonstrated that no patients experienced greater than moderate PVL, 1.9% experienced moderate PVL and 18.9% experienced mild PVL. Other notable findings from the study included a low 6.5% rate of new pacemaker implantation 30 days post procedure, with no incidence of disabling stroke or acute kidney injury.""With this foundational data set, we now have post-market surveillance results that validate the use of the current-generation ACURATE neo2 valve for the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis,"" said Dr. Lars SÃ¸ndergaard, professor of cardiology, DMSc, FESC, Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet and study co-principal investigator. ""The data suggest that the annular sealing technology minimizes leakage around the valve â providing greater improvement in PVL than observed with the prior-generation ACURATE neo valve â all while maintaining single-digit permanent pacemaker rates, which contributes to better long-term patient outcomes.""The single-arm, prospective ACURATE neo2 PMCF study includes 250 patients with severe aortic stenosis from 18 European centers and will evaluate outcomes for five years following the procedure. It also includes a primary imaging endpoint to assess the visually apparent thickening of the prosthetic valve leaflets (HALT), a phenomenon with theoretical potential effects on valve durability or thrombotic complications. The reported HALT rate of 24.5% at 30 days post procedure falls within the range presented in previous TAVR trials with competitive devices.Story continues""These trial data confirm the success of meaningful and differentiated enhancements included in the design of the ACURATE neo2 valve, from low rates of PVL and first-time pacemaker implantation to excellent hemodynamic performance and high rates of procedural success and safety,"" said Dr. Ian Meredith, global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. ""We look forward to reviewing longer-term results from this trial and bringing this differentiated TAVR technology to more patients and their physicians.""The ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System received CE Mark in 2020 and is being evaluated in the currently enrolling ACURATE IDE trial in the U.S. and Canada.To learn more, visit www.bostonscientific.com.eu/acurateneo2.*In the U.S., the ACURATE neo2TM Aortic Valve System is an investigational device and not available for sale.** Dr. SÃ¸ndergaard has not been compensated by Boston Scientific Corporation for his work on the ACURATE neo2 PMCF study or his quote within this news release.About Boston ScientificBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider.Across the world, investors have been scrambling to find ways to strengthen their portfolios and reduce risk as stock markets become more volatile due to rising inflation and interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation. Ordinary people are also exploring possible investments in dividend stocks for their retirement portfolios. In this context, there has been a flurry of activity in safe dividend plays like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).Â It is pertinent to mention that it is not always easy to set up a retirement portfolio. A study by GOBankingRates claims that 64% of workers in the United States have less than $10,000 saved for the exit from full-time employment. Among those aged 55 and older, almost 40% have no savings at all. These figures highlight the importance that an ordinary citizen must place on a retirement portfolio. Considering the present volatility of the markets, it is prudent to invest in safe dividend stocks for such a portfolio.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with impressive yields and a consistent history of payouts stretching back over more than a decade were preferred for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Dividend Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider11. ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Â Story continuesDividend Yield as of November 28: 5.72%Â Â Â Â Â Â ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) engages in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas in the United States. It is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 24, Guidewire, a software company which supports the entire insurance life cycle for leading insurers in 38 countries, announced that it has formed a strategic partnership with ONEOK to provide digital experiences for payments that deliver agility and flexibility throughout the insurance lifecycle from quote to claim payments.Â On October 19, Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad maintained an Equal Weight rating on ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $74, noting that fewer significant profit beats are predicted than in the second quarter.Â Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) with 1 million shares worth more than $52.7 million.Â Just like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement portfolio.Â In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Miller Howard Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn late August, we increased the portfolioâs cyclical exposure by trimming utilities after a period of relative outperformance and reallocating the capital to midstream energy, which had pulled back over the summer. We addedÂ ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Â with the expectation that it will benefit from increasing natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery in the Bakken region.â10. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 8.40%Â Â Â Â Â Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. It is one of the top dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 27, Altria Group revealed a strategic alliance with Japan tobacco, a leading international tobacco product manufacturer, with a global pursuit of a global smoke-free partnership to accelerate harm reduction.Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 47 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), compared to 48 in the preceding quarter worth $1.8 billion.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âAltria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Â shook off the prospects of a ban on menthol and a potential cap on nicotine and gained 20%. We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are availableÂ here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the marketâs multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x â 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.â9. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 7.56%Â Â Â Â Â Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. It is one of the premier dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio.

Analyst Scott Gruber issued the ratings update.Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 51 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), compared to 57 in the previous quarter worth $1.5 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOur biggest dollar gainer within this period wasÂ Devon Energy CorporationÂ (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devonâs thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what itâs like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devonâs Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathawayâs energy investments.â8. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 3.39%Â Â Â Â Â Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) stock and raised the price target to $92 from $84, noting that the company's third quarter results were strong due to the Veklury and HIV franchise. Â Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrow Street Capital is a leading shareholder in Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) with 12 million shares worth more than $742.5 million.Â In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOther pharma companies are providing solutions as well. Biopharmaceutical companyÂ Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)âs remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication administered by intravenous infusion; it can shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in non-hospitalized patients.â7.

Here is what the fund said:âOver the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.â6.

126,03b73f2a-f963-3e12-a4cb-ff7b5e422807,KO,2022-11-28,Investing in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) five years ago would have delivered you a 59% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-coca-cola-nyse-ko-110034087.html,1669633234,STORY,['KO'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) share price is up 36% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 17% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Coca-Cola managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Coca-Cola has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Coca-Cola the TSR over the last 5 years was 59%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Coca-Cola shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 20% over one year.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the hedge fund, its investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to Was Joseph Samuels's Islet Management Right About These 5 Stocks?We prepared the actual contents of this article in November last year, when we analyzed the Q2 portfolio of Joseph Samuels's Islet Management to discuss some of the notable stocks in the hedge fund portfolio at that time. We are publishing this article today because itâs always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called âsmart moneyâ is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong.In this article you will see the notable stock picks of Joseph Samuels's Islet Management as of the second quarter of last year.To assess the performance of these stocks, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months through November 27, 2022.At the time of writing we had mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks from famous Wall Street analysts. Itâd be interesting for our readers to see how right or wrong were these analystsâ price targets and calls.However, we should keep the 2022 market crash in mind when reading this article. You will notice that most of the stocks in this list lost value over the past 12 months. That doesnât, however, mean that the hedge fund was entirely wrong. The fund believes in holding stocks for longer periods of time. These holdings might end up creating profits for the hedge fund in the months and years to come as analysts believe the market could rebound strongly in 2023 and beyond.Itâs also important to note that the hedge fund sold or reduced its stakes in some of these stocks in the subsequent quarters of 2021 and 2022.Story continuesNow, letâs start the article by first reading the introduction to the hedge fund we wrote back in November 2021.Islet Management is a New-York based hedge fund that was founded by Mr. Joseph Samuels after he left his position as head of US equities and executive managing director at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group in July 2016. He worked at Och-Ziff Capital for 13 years. Before joining Och-Ziff, Mr. Samuels worked at the discontinued Pequot Capital Management and Merrill Lynch.Mr. Samuels' hedge fund uses a tactical long/short equity strategy focused on pinpointing and benefitting from three key opportunities, namely dislocations, transformative corporate events, and capital market opportunities.Dislocations in the market take place under stressful conditions that result in the mispricing of assets at a broad level. This theme came into play during the COVID-19 pandemic as various sectors came to a halt, resulting in the stock price of numerous prominent corporations plummeting, despite the businesses having strong fundamentals.The theme of a transformative business event is very much self-explanatory and the hedge fund is focused on capitalizing on such events for a corporation by taking a long/short position. According to Insider Monkey's database, the portfolio value of Joseph Samuel's Islet Management stood at approximately $3.63 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021.10.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221125005300/en/GE Healthcare branded CT Motion injector (Photo: Business Wire)Recent research, led by Dushyant Sahani MD, Professor and Chair of Radiology at the University of Washington and presented at the 2022 Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Congress, demonstrates that when compared to a typical dual-syringe based injector using single or multi-dose vials, the CT motion may enable six additional patient CT exams each day in a busy Emergency Department, with up to three minutes saved per patient. The research, which analyzed over 6,000 patients who received Contrast Enhanced CT or CT Angiography, also shows CT Motion reduces cost from consumables and saves an average 30 mL of contrast per procedure.The U.S. contrast media injector market is estimated to grow at 4.3 percent annuallyi between 2022-2030, attributed to its developed healthcare infrastructure and the prevalence of chronic diseases.Story continuesToday, the majority of contrast enhanced CT imaging involves radiology technicians filling a syringe with contrast media prior the injection procedure. With the syringeless CT motion, the required dose is drawn and injected directly from the injectorâs contrast media container, saving time, facilitating the optimal volume of contrast media will be used, reducing wasted leftover contrast and generating less disposable waste. CT motion also provides injection reports accessible via RIS/PACS for dose management systems and records of prior injections to further optimize dose and improve patient safety.Marco Campione, Americas General Manager at GE Healthcare Pharmaceutical Diagnostics said: ""Radiology departments are focused on managing increasing demand and on conserving contrast media. The CT motion supports efficient operational practices - saving time, saving contrast, saving on consumables, improving workflows and facilitates better patient throughput. We expect demand for iodinated contrast media to double in the next decade, so we are investing, both in production capacity expansion and also in technologies like this that conserve volumes and reduce leftover contrast media.""Klaus Kiesel, CEO ulrich medical, said: ""We are delighted to be working even more closely with our long-standing partner GE Healthcare, who have already been distributing our injector CT motion in the US market. With GE Healthcare's nationwide brand recognition and great distribution power, we are sure to significantly expand our market share on injectors in the world's largest medical technology market.""As part of its broader commitment to address growing demand for iodinated contrast media, GE Healthcare recently opened a new 30 million USD additional manufacturing line at its facility in Cork, Ireland, announced an 80 million USD investment to increase capacity at its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients site in Lindesnes, Norway, and signed an agreement with the Chile based mining company, SQM, to secure an increasing supply of the key raw material, iodine. These milestones are contributing to GE Healthcareâs aim to produce 30 million more patient doses of iodinated contrast media annually by 2025.GE Healthcareâs Pharmaceutical Diagnostics unit is a global leader in imaging agents used to support around 100 million procedures per year globally, equivalent to three patient procedures every second. All stages of its contrast media manufacturing, from development of API to finished product, are managed entirely by GE Healthcare, adhering to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). With over 4000 employees globally and seven manufacturing sites, the business also develops and supplies radiopharmaceuticals used to support diagnosis, monitoring and treatment selection across Neurology, Cardiology and Oncology clinical pathways.Dr Sahani will present an abstract from the GE Healthcare funded study ""Improving CT workflow and in a busy subspeciality emergency room using a novel power injector technology"" on November 30th at 8:00 am â 9:00 am CT, during Session W1-SSNPM03: Noninterpretive Skills/Quality Improvement/Practice Management (Optimizing Radiology Care Delivery)ENDSAbout CT motionDeveloped by ulrich medical, based in Ulm, Germany, the design of the CT motion draws on 30 years of medical imaging experience and is already used globally.

Given that the stock prices usually follow long-term business performance, we wonder if the company's mixed financials could have any adverse effect on its current price price movement Specifically, we decided to study Progressive's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Progressive How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) Ã· Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.8% = US$857m Ã· US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a companyâs earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.8% ROEAt first glance, Progressive's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 13%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Progressive was still able to see a decent net income growth of 7.1% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Progressive's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 12% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. Itâs important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is PGR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Progressive Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Progressive has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 50%, meaning that it is left with only 50% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Besides, Progressive has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 23% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Progressive can be open to many interpretations. While the company has posted a decent earnings growth, We do feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings at a higher rate of return. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) shareholders have seen the share price rise 55% over three years, well in excess of the market return (25%, not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for LKQ To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, LKQ achieved compound earnings per share growth of 47% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how LKQ has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on LKQ's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for LKQ the TSR over the last 3 years was 59%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that LKQ shares lost 2.8% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 17%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 7% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand LKQ better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for LKQ (1 is concerning)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 18% also doesn't go unnoticed by us.

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider.Across the world, investors have been scrambling to find ways to strengthen their portfolios and reduce risk as stock markets become more volatile due to rising inflation and interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation. Ordinary people are also exploring possible investments in dividend stocks for their retirement portfolios. In this context, there has been a flurry of activity in safe dividend plays like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).Â It is pertinent to mention that it is not always easy to set up a retirement portfolio. A study by GOBankingRates claims that 64% of workers in the United States have less than $10,000 saved for the exit from full-time employment. Among those aged 55 and older, almost 40% have no savings at all. These figures highlight the importance that an ordinary citizen must place on a retirement portfolio. Considering the present volatility of the markets, it is prudent to invest in safe dividend stocks for such a portfolio.Â Our MethodologyThe companies that have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with impressive yields and a consistent history of payouts stretching back over more than a decade were preferred for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Dividend Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Dividend Stocks to Consider11. ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Â Story continuesDividend Yield as of November 28: 5.72%Â Â Â Â Â Â ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) engages in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas in the United States. It is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 24, Guidewire, a software company which supports the entire insurance life cycle for leading insurers in 38 countries, announced that it has formed a strategic partnership with ONEOK to provide digital experiences for payments that deliver agility and flexibility throughout the insurance lifecycle from quote to claim payments.Â On October 19, Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad maintained an Equal Weight rating on ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $74, noting that fewer significant profit beats are predicted than in the second quarter.Â Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) with 1 million shares worth more than $52.7 million.Â Just like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is one of the best dividend stocks for a retirement portfolio.Â In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Miller Howard Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âIn late August, we increased the portfolioâs cyclical exposure by trimming utilities after a period of relative outperformance and reallocating the capital to midstream energy, which had pulled back over the summer. We addedÂ ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE)Â with the expectation that it will benefit from increasing natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery in the Bakken region.â10. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 8.40%Â Â Â Â Â Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. It is one of the top dividend stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 27, Altria Group revealed a strategic alliance with Japan tobacco, a leading international tobacco product manufacturer, with a global pursuit of a global smoke-free partnership to accelerate harm reduction.Â At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 47 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), compared to 48 in the preceding quarter worth $1.8 billion.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altria Group, Inc.

We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are availableÂ here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the marketâs multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x â 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.â9. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Â Â Â Â Â Dividend Yield as of November 28: 7.56%Â Â Â Â Â Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

Here is what the fund said:âOur biggest dollar gainer within this period wasÂ Devon Energy CorporationÂ (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devonâs thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what itâs like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devonâs Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathawayâs energy investments.â8.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:âOther pharma companies are providing solutions as well. Biopharmaceutical companyÂ Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)âs remdesivir, sold under the brand name Veklury, is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication administered by intravenous infusion; it can shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in non-hospitalized patients.â7.

Here is what the fund said:âOver the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.â6.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time.Â This year has been challenging for investors due to continuous interest rate hikes and an all-time high inflation. According to a recent survey conducted by Nationwideâs eighth annual Advisor Authority, only 39% of investors are optimistic about their 12-month financial outlook, and 54% of investors expect further market volatility during the same period. According to analysts, investors should focus on dividend stocks because these securities have historically performed well during previous inflationary periods.Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist of Morningstar, recently spoke to her financial services company about the importance of dividend stocks. She asserted that in six recessionary periods going back to 1980, dividend stocks outperformed the broader market in three of those periods. Similarly, Morningstarâs editorial director David Harrell also talked about the performance of dividend stocks this year with the same channel.

These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

Here is what the firm has to say:âThird Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the companyâs Hillâs Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgateâs consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hillâs or Colgateâs ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recoverâ¦â (Click here to view the full text)7.
