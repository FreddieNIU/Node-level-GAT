You should consider the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/11/2009.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $15.53 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap GrowthCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. When you consider growth versus value, growth stocks are usually the clear winner in strong bull markets but tend to fall flat in nearly all other environments.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.49%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 48.40% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 12.98% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 48.47% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHG seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted and includes the large-cap growth portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.The ETF has added about 12.42% so far this year and is down about -10.41% in the last one year (as of 03/17/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $54.19 and $76.73.The ETF has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 26.95% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 247 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHG is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $77.70 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $164.13 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The data cover the three days through March 15.Amid wild gyrations in financial markets, the shift in client assets isn’t likely to jeopardize Schwab. The firm’s own government and Treasury funds had inflows in each of the same three days totaling about $14 billion, according to the company’s data.The shifts represent clients focused on safety who are moving from prime money funds to government money funds – “all within Schwab,” Mike Peterson, a company spokesman, said via email. “Those shifts from one category to the other happen all the time. This one is larger, but is part of a broader industry trend and is not unique to Schwab.”Wider TrendThe flows at Schwab match the pattern in data from the Investment Company Institute, which show prime fund assets decreased by $18 billion industrywide for the week ending March 15, while total money market fund assets increased by $121 billion.While outflows from funds are a risk for Schwab, the overall franchise remains healthy, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report. “Schwab’s stronger base of mostly FDIC-insured retail deposits is a key support from contagion outflows,” wrote analysts led by Neil Sipes.Story continuesPrime funds differ from government and Treasury money market funds, which have grown in popularity since the financial crisis of 2008 and since the market rout at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.Prime FlowsThe prime fund outflows started after a weekend in which Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed, and investors scrambled to assess firms including First Republic Bank and PacWest Bancorp. Schwab’s banking unit had $14 billion in unrealized losses in its portfolio of held-to-maturity assets at the end of 2022, leading company executives to seek to reassure investors this week that it has sufficient liquidity to overcome market volatility.“Though its larger exposure to fixed-rate securities does resemble that of fallen SVB, we see the risk of unrealized losses materializing as tempered by Fed relief and Schwab’s ability to generate liquidity organically,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Schwab’s money market funds are stress-tested for their exposure to interest rate changes and have daily and weekly liquidity levels above regulatory requirements, according to Peterson.Schwab’s shares traded as low as $45 on March 13, their lowest intraday price in more than two years. They are down about 24% since March 8, when depositors fled Silicon Valley Bank and questions mounted about the wider financial system. The stock fell 2.8% to $57.88 in regular New York trading Thursday.The Schwab funds are among the largest prime money funds in the US, a product that typically invests in securities issued by financial institutions and non-financial companies. Prime funds are a source of capital for many of the world’s largest financial institutions, and the Schwab funds held certificates of deposit from Deutsche Bank AG and Truist Bank as well as commercial paper issued by units of Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., according to fund documents.Investors have rushed into Treasury and government money market funds in the last week, pushing combined money fund assets to a record $5.39 trillion as of March 15, according to Crane Data, a firm that specializes in monitoring the industry.“We are experiencing inflows across the board, generally into all of our liquidity products,” Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes Inc., said in an email. “It seems to be coming from bank deposit products more than anything else.”(Updates with data on inflows to government funds, starting from the first paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFoxconn Finds EVs Are Harder to Build Than iPhonesBrazil’s Surprise Oil Tax Puts $20 Billion in Investment at RiskGlencore CEO Rides Coal Windfall on the Way to a Low-Carbon WorldThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile EconomyInside TikTok’s Fight to Avoid a US Ban©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

GRWG reported a loss per share of 25 cents in the fourth quarter of 2022, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents per share. The company reported a loss per share of 7 cents in the fourth quarter of 2021. The results reflect the ongoing weakness in the cannabis industry, the company’s inventory clearance measures and recognition of obsolete inventory.GrowGeneration generated revenues of $54 million in the quarter under review, which declined 40% year over year, highlighting the weak industry demand. The top line however beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $50.6 million. Comparable store sales in the quarter plunged 52% from the prior year.The cost of sales declined 33.5% year on year to $44.9 million in the quarter. Gross profit slumped 59% year over year to $9.6 million due to aggressive inventory clearance and an increase in inventory reserves. The gross margin was 17.6% in the quarter under review compared with 25.5% in the prior-year quarter.Store operating costs were $12.8 million compared with $14.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were down 24% year on year to $8.6 million in the quarter under review. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $10.2 million in the quarter against the prior-year quarter’s loss of $1.7 million. The loss in the quarter under review was a result of $1 million in expenses associated with the closure of Las Vegas, Compton, and Cotati locations and nearly $4 million associated with inventory cleanup measures.Financial PositionAt the end of 2022, GrowGeneration had cash and short-term marketable securities of $72 million. Inventory was $77 million, and prepaid and other current assets were $6.45 million at 2022-end. Total current liabilities, including accounts payable and accrued payroll and other liabilities, were $36 million at the end of 2022.On Nov 3, 2022, GRWG acquired certain assets of St. Louis Hydroponic Company, a hydroponic retail store in St. Louis, MO.

The company reported earnings per share of 21 cents in 2021.GrowGeneration generated revenues of $279 million in 2022, which declined 34% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $274.4 million2023 GuidanceConsidering the ongoing weakness in the broader cannabis and hydroponic industries, GRWG has been right-sizing its cost structure, lowering inventory and consolidating its store footprint. The company expects its margins to benefit from cost savings stemming from store consolidations, reduced payroll expenses, declining ocean freight rates and reduced headwinds from inventory discounting. The favorable mix impact from a greater proportion of private label and proprietary brand sales is also expected to favor results.The company expects to deliver sequential improvement in revenues in the first quarter of 2023 for the first time in seven quarters. It also projects sequential growth in the rest of the quarters of the year. Margins are expected to normalize in the first quarter and for the balance of the year. First-quarter 2023 net revenues are projected in the range of $55 million to $57 million.

8,c4a9bc28-2077-385a-b8a3-c17e038c085c,NUE,2023-03-17,Nucor Corporation (NUE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-trending-stock-130001831.html,1678971601,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this steel company have returned -14.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.9% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 9.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.13 per share, indicating a change of -46.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.35 points to a change of -50.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +10.5%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.43 indicates a change of -13.4% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.2%. The $33.1 billion and $29.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -20.3% and -12.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.8%. EPS of $4.89 for the same period compares with $7.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.29%. The EPS surprise was +16.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GSL, Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A. CCU, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Unum Group UNM and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. EBR.Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks with Impressive EV/EBITDA RatiosPrice-to-earnings (P/E), given its inherent simplicity, is the most commonly used metric in the value investing world. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at a bargain. However, even this straightforward, broadly used valuation metric has a few downsides.Although P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company's valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm's equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Global Ship Lease, Inc., Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A., Sterling Infrastructure, Inc., Unum Group and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV-to-EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In essence, it is the entire value of a company.EBITDA, the other constituent of the ratio, gives a clearer picture of a company's profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dampen net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Generally, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued. Story continuesHowever, unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company's balance sheet. Given this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is usually used to value the possible acquisition targets. Stocks with a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates.Another drawback of P/E is that it can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A company's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements.As such, a strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen bargain stocks.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that passed the screen:Global Ship Lease owns containerships with a diversified fleet of mid-sized and smaller containerships.

11,62be2153-0f97-3a18-8c8c-574e3d71f4a8,TMO,2023-03-17,Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) shareholders have earned a 22% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-tmo-110139147.html,1679050899,STORY,['TMO'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stock is up an impressive 172% over the last five years. Meanwhile the share price is 2.4% higher than it was a week ago.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Thermo Fisher Scientific achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 22% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Thermo Fisher Scientific's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Thermo Fisher Scientific's TSR for the last 5 years was 176%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Thermo Fisher Scientific returned a loss of 5.2% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 12%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 22% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Thermo Fisher Scientific has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

19,b03f07d6-f277-36df-ba58-1dd187706fdf,WMT,2023-03-17,Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.57,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-nyse-wmt-increasing-dividend-101752138.html,1679048272,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 30th of May to $0.57. This takes the annual payment to 1.6% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Walmart's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 67.8% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 32%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.88, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 1.9% per annum over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.We Could See Walmart's Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Walmart has impressed us by growing EPS at 5.6% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.We Really Like Walmart's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

I'm glad to be speaking with you as the new CEO of The Honest Company, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the months ahead. Before starting at Honest, a little over 2 months ago, I was the Vice President of Consumables Categories at the leading e-commerce retailer in the United States, which gave me the opportunity to get to know the categories that Honest participates in. I also oversaw the supply chain and digital storefront innovation for those categories. In that role, I got a first-hand view of how strongly The Honest brand performs with the consumers we serve and the key operational elements of running a high-performing e-commerce business. In that retailer-vendor partnership, I also had the opportunity to get to know several of our key leaders, including our founder, Jessica Alba. Since that early beginning of partners, I've been impressed with the quality of Honest products, the strength of the brand and The Honest mission to make purpose-driven consumer products designed for all people. My work leading categories in e-commerce builds nicely on another set of experiences that have helped me hit the ground running here at Honest. As a division President, at a leading CPG company, I have more than two decades of experience building and growing some of America's most classic brands. In that role, I also ran a portfolio of sustainability-driven founder-built businesses, giving me a deep understanding for the important financial, operational and consumer drivers required to have a strong brand portfolio. My degree in ecology and career in sustainability allowed me to build the triple bottom line ESG business principles of sustainability, strong culture and profitability into mission-driven brands business models much like Honest. When Honest was launched 11 years ago, it disrupted and modernized many categories by bringing a new standard of product design to categories ranging from Baby, Beauty and Personal Care to Household and Wellness. Our standards for clean and highly efficacious products have allowed Honest to lead innovation in our categories and drive growth for our partners. And our origin as a company built in the Gen Z era has poised us to be relevant, relatable and available to a broad cross-section of consumers through a truly omnichannel business model. Since joining Honest, I've had the opportunity to meet with some of our key retail and manufacturing partners. I've spent time in stores with my team seeing the many ways that the Honest brand comes to life. And most importantly, I've had the opportunity to talk with Honest's consumers and employees about what attracts them to Honest. And time and time again, the answer is grounded in the values embedded in the brand and the company. These early touch points, along with the strength of our mission and our products gives me the confidence that we have a great future ahead. I firmly believe that Honest is a powerful brand that resonates with an ever-diversifying consumer base. However, as I noted in the earnings release, we are not satisfied with the revenue and margin results. We do not believe they reflect the strength and potential of The Honest brand. In 2023, we will be relentlessly focused on taking actions and defining a strategy to set us up to be a stronger, more profitable company in 2024 and beyond. I'm thrilled to support our team, our consumers and our many partners in the next stage of Honest journey. Kelly, I'll turn it over to you to review the financials.Kelly J. KennedyThank you, Carla, and welcome, everyone. We were pleased with revenue in the quarter, which came in slightly ahead of expectations but faced continuing cost pressures, which impacted margins. Starting with the top line. Fourth quarter revenue was up 2% versus a year ago, driven by strong performance in retail, reflecting healthy consumption and distribution increases as well as pricing actions taken in 2022, partially offset by continuing softness in the digital channel. Honest consumption in the fourth quarter was up 15%. Based on these results, it is clear The Honest brand continues to resonate with consumers. Honest is gaining market share in tracked channels as our growth continues to outpace the categories where we compete. Our unit velocities remain healthy, following 2022 price increases as both, volume and pricing, are supporting our top line growth. Turning to key drivers by product category. First, Diapers and Wipes. Our Diapers and Wipes business represented approximately 60% of revenue this quarter and was up 1%. Wipes consumption was up 24% and diapers consumption was up 23%, outpacing category growth by over 15 percentage points. Growth reflected the benefit of price increases, retail distribution expansion and increased assortment. Wipes also benefited from expanded usage around the home beyond diapering. We continue to innovate in this category and now can announce that 94% of our baby wipes portfolio are home compostable. Strong consumption gains in Diapers and Wipes were offset by declining traffic and subscriptions in our digital channel. Shipments with a key digital customer also lagged consumption as they reduced fourth quarter purchases. Skin and Personal Care, which represented nearly 30% of total revenue this quarter, declined 13% year-over-year. Revenue was impacted by the reduced shipments we mentioned by our key digital customer. We continue to innovate our Beauty and Skin Care portfolio with the Q1 launch of our new daily green juice antioxidant super serum. This serum was developed with Gen Z and Latino consumer in mind. With easy-to-understand ingredients, such as kale, lemon, carrot, goji, green tea and apple. It is inspired by the feeling of a fresh moisturized face, and it speaks to the minimalist trend in skin care. Our Household and Wellness business represented just over 10% of revenue this quarter and doubled year-over-year, driven by Honest baby clothing. We continue to anticipate solid growth on this business in 2023 as our bedding, blankets and seasonal pajamas nicely complement our current Baby Care offering. In Q4, Honest's [baby] pajamas was on Oprah's Favorite Things list in 2022 for a second year in a row. Now turning to results by channel. Revenue in Q4 was split, 57% retail and 43% digital, reflecting recent retail distribution wins as well as softness in the digital channel. Digital channel revenue declined 14% as shipments lag consumption at our largest digital customer. And in light of increased cost of digital marketing, we shifted marketing spend to higher return opportunities to support retail expansion. Despite these near-term headwinds, we are continuing to improve our digital platform, including faster checkout and site speed as well as expanding the build-your-own bundle program to include a broad cross section of products, which drives larger basket sizes. Now turning to retail, where revenue increased 18%, reflecting strong traffic and consumption at our largest customer, distribution expansion, assortment gains and strong in-store execution. In 2022, we increased placements from 43,000 retail locations to over 50,000. As a result, ACV increased from 49% to 72%. Key distribution wins during the year included the launch into over 2,500 Walmart stores and the addition of Publix, Ulta and additional assortment at Kroger. At Target, our largest customer, we achieved 20 consecutive quarters of year-over-year consumption growth. We are very pleased that Honest has become the #1 baby personal care brand at Target. Now turning to gross margin. Gross margin was 27.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects approximately 800 basis points of higher supply chain costs offset by 550 basis points of positive impact from pricing, cost savings and favorable mix. We've continued to experience a post-COVID slowdown in our standardization business, which resulted in an approximate $2 million noncash inventory reserve in the quarter, in line with Q4 2021. Turning to operating costs and profitability. Operating expenses increased $3 million this quarter but were lower than a year ago if we exclude a $6 million CEO transition expense and $1 million in security litigation expense. Marketing spend was 12% of sales, in line with plan. We shifted our marketing investment from lower funnel digital tactics, the higher-return retail marketing levers, where we believe we can cost effectively reach our consumers and support new distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was negative $1.6 million, a nearly $4 million improvement from Q3 and $2 million favorable to Q4 of 2021. We fell short of our goal of being positive for the quarter due to the margin pressure we experienced related to the standardization product inventory reserve as well as escalated transportation and warehousing costs. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $15 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with no debt. This reflected $50 million in inventory purchases in advance of increased supplier prices in early 2023. Over 2023, we expect to sell down inventory to more normalized levels, generating approximately $20 million in cash. In January, we entered into a new $35 million asset-based credit facility that provides us with more financial flexibility. We have the ability to request up to $70 million to support future growth investments. Now turning to 2023. As Carla highlighted, we stand on the foundation of a strong brand, but we have significant work to do. And we've already gotten started. For example, we recently communicated new pricing actions in 2023 to reflect our premium positioning. And we've initiated robust cost savings programs as well. Prior to introducing our improved margin improvement roadmap, our full year 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA would be in line with our fiscal year 2022 results. With that, let me turn it back to Carla before we open it up for questions.Carla VernonThanks, Kelly. I want to reinforce that we are not satisfied. So now our focus is on marrying the quality of our product and our premium positioning to our pricing strategy, along with advancing cost savings initiatives and improving our margin structure. We plan to address our business challenges head on in 2023 and put Honest back on a path to profitability with meaningful benefits expected in 2024. Despite the current challenges, we are confident. Our distribution is healthy, our market shares are growing, and The Honest brand is strong. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator, and we look forward to answering your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital.Laura Allyson ChampineIt's for Carla, and it's sort of a longer-term question. So since the IPO, the digital business has not had the kind of growth trajectory that we had been hoping for. Can you talk a little bit about, given your background in this particular channel, what the action steps are for Honest to turn that business around?Carla VernonLaura, it's lovely to meet you. Thank you for that question. Yes, absolutely. One of the things that I am excited to be bringing to Honest is the experience I had at Amazon. At Amazon, as the Vice President of Consumables Categories, I have responsibility for the digital store fronts for all of the categories that you might consider center-store categories, and so many of those were categories that Honest participates in. In addition to being responsible for the store fronts, my team and I were also responsible for innovation about how to bring brands to life better on those storefronts. That experience is going to pull directly into what we do here at Honest and how the digital team and I collaborate on what we need to do in order to make sure that our honest.com storefront continues to meet today's expectations of the digital shopper. And that has everything to do with things from being efficient in the experience of the storefront, really making sure you maximize the storefront, so that the consumer transactions are clear, efficient and fast and so that we can really customize what we show to customers on the storefront, so that when they're shopping, it's an experience that's highly relevant for them. In addition to that, our digital business is also brought to life through some of our strongest retail partnerships, right? So as we continue to grow with our retail partners, we want to make sure that Honest is effectively being brought to life in the digital mediums that they are continuing to grow and invest in.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.Dana Lauren TelseyNice to meet you, Carla. As you think about the margin improvement roadmap, how do you think about it given in the vein of the guidance of this upcoming fiscal year and what it could look like going forward? And as you think of the expanded retail portfolio that you have now of distribution, how are you thinking about pricing? How you're thinking about margins and revenue as we move forward?Carla VernonGood to meet you as well. The first and most important thing for me to make sure I emphasize and get across is, we are not satisfied with what we have delivered thus far on margin and on profit. And so our team is squarely focused on making sure we have discipline and rigor with what are the most important things to continue to fix and optimize about our portfolio and how we operate, so that we quickly improve our margin footprint of our business. That really is brought to life through a number of things that we will do and that we will continue to assess as we develop that margin roadmap. Margin is important for us to address on a pricing level as you've said. So I think what I'm going to do is allow Kelly to get in more detail with you about our plans for pricing, but it is also imperative that we work on cost out and cost savings projects. We have many of those projects already underway. But in my time since I've arrived, we have accelerated the conversation and really made sure that we are applying discipline and being very exploratory and understanding where else there are opportunities to partner on all the drivers of cost in our P&amp;L. I look forward to being back with you to tell you more specifics about the areas we are going to address, but that is one of the important pieces for us in improving the margin outlook. Then, of course, the margin outlook is also driven by the portfolio mix. So I want you to know that we will make choices as we assess which items in our portfolio are driving growth, which items in our portfolio, we think, have margins that are at or accretive to our overall margin roadmap and our margin trajectory, and we will make the choices that we need to make, whether that means that we will start ourselves -- start retracting from some of the categories that we are in that we don't think can be reimagined to really be up to speed with the margins we're looking to get as well as considering where we can play that is a fit for The Honest brand that allows us to lead and win and have margins and pricing that fits a brand that always delivers premium input and a premium position.Kelly J. KennedyI'm happy to talk a little on pricing and kind of what we plan to do in 2023, because we did highlight it today. I wanted to put in perspective first, and remind everyone that we faced in 2022, roughly 800 basis points of basically input cost pressure. And in 2022, we did take pricing action on a significant portion of our portfolio, but that pricing only covered approximately half of that input cost pressure. So around 400 basis points. What that has done for us is left us in a position where we kind of lost our ideal price premium to the conventional product into the competition. So we have announced pricing that will go into effect mid-year over the course of the back half of 2023. And that pricing is going to be mid- to high single-digit price increases on roughly 50% of our revenue base. And it will impact all product categories, and it's going to return us to our pre-COVID premium, for example, in areas like diapers, where pre-COVID, we were at 15% premium kind of leading player. We're now down to about half of that. It will return our premium, where we know that, that is, for The Honest brand, it aligns with our premium positioning. In addition, that impact of pricing overall will be about 400-digital basis points, but it's going to be back half weighted. So we are facing additional cost pressures in 2023. That's reflective in how we're thinking about the impact of pricing both, on the top line as well as margin pressure we'll see in the first half that as we move in and get to the end of 2023 and 2024, we will have offset our input cost pressures fully with the pricing we've taken.Dana Lauren TelseyAnd just one follow-up on inventory levels. How do you see the pace of inventory as we move forward given the 53% increase at the end of this quarter?Kelly J. KennedyYes. On inventory levels, we know that we're ahead of where we should be. We have already started taking actions. You'll see that over the course of 2023, we'll reduce inventory by approximately $20 million, and that will be paced across the quarter. So you will see us -- it was a use of cash as we built inventory in 2022. We've now seen lead times normalized. We are now in the process of kind of turning the corner in terms of that being a generation -- cash generation for us in 2023.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraCarla, welcome, great to have you leading The Honest Company. So I discussed earlier with the IR team, Steve and Elizabeth, regarding what initially was your overview before Carla joined in terms of like the first half of '23 being potentially a 7% to 8% growth given the carryover pricing. Clearly, it seems that you removed that, and I was just wondering what happened, both on that front and also on the gross margin front. I don't believe that you expected margins to be still bad in the quarter. Obviously, Kelly, you called out on the SG&amp;A side, some pressures there that are probably not recurring. So if you can comment a little bit on the top line, why things have been so negative given that, to your point, your price ladder is actually relatively more attractive to your competitors, which have taken pricing. You haven't taken pricing as much. What happened there is that mostly Amazon and taking inventory down, we thought that they would finally get the orders in. Clearly, that didn't happen. So can you kind of explain? And then on Carla, you also mentioned -- I know it's a lot, but you also mentioned the possibility of rightsizing your portfolio. So I was wondering, some of the dream, of course, of extending The Honest company the right to win in some of this category, including VMS. It was kind of like -- would make sense, it seems that those investments did not bear fruit. How should we be thinking of looking at your kind of first 100 years or so at some point in the next few weeks coming to us and explaining what the plan is in terms of getting, number one, the top line moving in the right direction; and number two, getting the margins where they should be?Kelly J. KennedyI'll start, and then I'll let -- I'll turn it over to Carla. I thought I would start by just talking a little bit about 2023 as we think about revenue and margin. We do anticipate growth in the first half, but we expect that to moderate as we move into the back half, we do expect revenue to be in line with 2022. Clearly, let me talk first about what is on track. We are continuing to see healthy consumption in our track channels. We do anticipate, based on the pricing that we'll be taking that we will see a short-term impact on our unit velocity. We've been really pleased with the elasticity we saw in pricing in 2022, but we recognized as a new -- another layer of the same products of pricing we'll be taking. Both, Walmart and Baby Clothing, we will -- we've been very pleased, particularly in Walmart, with the penetration we've seen in the Southeast and also that, that business has deemed to be an incremental consumer to us, which is exciting and is in on the right path. However, we continue to see headwinds, particularly in digital and declines in traffic. We've also shifted our spending to where we see a higher return. So we've intentionally reduced our lower funnel digital spend, and we feel that, that has really allowed us to leverage our marketing and do kind of have more efficiency within our marketing spend. So overall, if you think about 2023, there's still trends going against us. We don't anticipate to have -- we think the Amazon levels of inventory are healthy. We've seen some good consumption trends in Amazon. It was positive 8% in Q4, but we know that they have been very closely managing their inventory. So again, 2023 revenue really reflects continued positive trends on the retail side, headwinds on digital and really a thoughtful approach around what the pricing and velocity impact maybe in the short term. Although we know, overtime, that tends to dissipate. As we think about margin, you are correct, we are seeing stronger cost pressures than we anticipated. And that's across both, transportation, warehousing as well as product cost. And for us, that's really around timing. We feel very confident in our ability to take pricing to cover those input costs, but we didn't take it in 2022. And so there is a timing delay and we'll continue to see margin pressure in 2023, although as we get into the back half and see the impact of that pricing on margins, that will, over the course of 2023, improve. And we anticipate 2024 covering the input cost pressure with the pricing actions we've taken. So very positive.Carla VernonAndrea, this is Carla. So I think what I want to make sure is that I'm clear on your question. I'm interpreting your question as trying to understand if we still believe that Honest has the right to play in multiple categories and if we see category opportunities expanding as we look out to the future. So if that's the right understanding your question. What I want to tell you is -- thank you. First of all, the reason I came to honest is that in my experience of running both, start-up founder-built companies like -- start-up and founder-built brands like Larabar, like Annie's as well as running classic brands that have shown their ability to weather through the test of time, like Cheerios or Nature Valley. One of my fundamental beliefs is that for consumer brands born in this era, right, and I always say that Honest was born in a Gen Z era. One of the important things is whether that brand has the ability to have broad shoulders, to have more than just a single point of relevance or a single category of relevance, and that was already demonstrated to be true with The Honest brand. I think the choices to expand that brand early in its history to multiple categories was important and continues to be so. One of the things that we are going to do and what I want to make clear from my message is that we know that Honest is relevant across life stages, right? We already have consumer groups across every demographic age group, across every demographic cultural group. And so as we choose our categories going forward, we want to be thoughtful that those categories are categories where Honest can lead, innovate and win, because that's what we exist to do. We exist to push our categories farther with our purpose-driven ethos, but we also want to choose categories thoughtfully that fit the overall margin portfolio strategy, we will go forward with that will allow it to operate with the premium inputs we put into our products and the premium positioning and the ways we communicate with our consumers today. That's how we'll make the choices of where we play, but I can assure you there are lots of those opportunities ahead of us.Andrea Faria TeixeiraSo it does not -- no, that's helpful, Carla. And it does not include in your guide, to Kelly's point about the pricing, the puts and takes on pricing. Obviously, the volumes are going to come down. So it does not include any rationalization of getting out of categories, it's just as it is on an ongoing basis.Carla VernonWell, we are, of course, still refining and working on the strategy, right? In the 10 weeks that I've been here, I've had an opportunity to do a lot of assessments on our current portfolio and understand, do we -- is everything we're in today going to be part of our program going forward? And the truth of the matter is, Andrea, there are some things that we are in today that we will deprioritize going forward and may even get out of. But those things will make sense, and they will be things that actually really give us the ability to have more momentum over the places where we want to invest. We want to grow. We believe innovation is going to be something that's going to be embraced by both, the consumer and the retailer, so that we can drive continued growth and bring new benefits to the categories where we play. So it will be a mix of really taking a look at what we have today and determining that some of those things don't fit the marginal growth profile where we're going forward to emphasizing and investing in some of our hero products that we actually have the opportunity to really grow and build. That's something I learned on brands like Nature Valley, a business that has many, many SKU offerings, but some of them are very core to driving the fundamental growth and business model of the brand and then new places to play where they will really fit our business model as we go forward.Andrea Faria TeixeiraThat's -- and the only other thing, sorry, if I can -- I did mention SG&amp;A. And Kelly, you quoted some of the known [extraordinary] items that we should be removing or should we not -- should we -- because I understand and I appreciate that you don't have an adjusted number, but it will be nice to see how much overhead we should be banking, and how much marketing spending we should be thinking as we go embedded in your guide?Kelly J. KennedyWell, I can give you a quick highlight. As you think about marketing, one of the things that we've been talking a lot about is how the shift in spending has allowed us to be more efficient. And so we were at 12% for the fourth quarter. As we go forward, I think you can think about that as our baseline, and then we lean in to innovation. And as Carla highlighted, overtime, as we figure out what that future innovation and kind of will look like in the longer term, we will absolutely adjust the marketing spend to be appropriate to the categories we move it. But right now, we found more efficiency, and you can anticipate that going into 2023. As it relates to SG&amp;A, I know we have been throughout 2022, managing that very carefully. For example, our headcount is actually down 5% from where we were kind of mid-2022, we've been very cautious and careful in SG&amp;A and will continue. And our cost savings programs are predominantly focused on margin, but we will also be looking for savings as well within SG&amp;A as well.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.Jon Robert AndersenCarla, it's nice to meet you and look forward to meeting you in person in the future. Quick question, one kind of a housekeeping and then a little bit more detailed question. With respect to the margin improvement roadmap that you're working through right now, could you talk a little bit about perhaps your anticipated timeline for kind of laying that out in more detail and perhaps when that will affect kind of the outlook? Is this something that could happen in 2023 and modify the initial kind of guidance that you've provided? And then a second question is, wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the initial results that you're seeing in market, for example, with the Diapers and Wipes rollout at Walmart, the incremental stores and some of the other kind of assortment enhancements you've experienced, say, with Target, et cetera.Kelly J. KennedyThanks, Jon. I'll start out talking real quickly about the margin improvement roadmap. There's a couple of components to that, some of which will benefit us in 2023, but predominantly the impact of the margin improvement road map is going to be a benefit to 2024. On the actions that we've already starting, for example, the pricing actions are already embedded in the color that we've given -- provided on 2023. The items that will take more time to really roll in our projects around the cost savings, which will include looking at transportation, fulfillment as well as ingredients and packaging. So those -- because of inventory levels and the timing it takes to implement those projects with third-party manufacturers, those will come in late in 2023. So those would be beneficial in 2024. We're also working with our suppliers on some productivity improvements that we can pass lower costs through. And as I think we spoke a little bit about -- Carla spoke about just enhancing and leaning in between our higher-margin hero items, that's also something that we're going to begin working on in 2023 will come back. So I would say high level margin improvement roadmap predominantly benefit to 2024.The second question around Walmart. We mentioned that as we moved in, it represented around 4% of our revenue in 2023. But really, we are just early in our days with Walmart. We're seeing some really great results and momentum in areas such as Wipes, where we're doing a special program with Walmart. We also participated in -- started mid-February, it goes to the end of March, the Walmart baby days and [honestly selected] as a product to be featured in some of their store events. And so far, we feel that's going well. More to come as we kind of see what the momentum is going into 2023 and having more time within the consumption data to talk more about those trends. The last question on Target, Jon, I'm not sure I caught what your question on Target was. I know that we highlighted that, that has certainly been one of the strength areas for us as we had 20 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. And things such as beauty, where in the fourth quarter, we grew 20%. So we're seeing some good momentum with our business overall with Target.Jon Robert AndersenGreat. One quick follow-up maybe for Carla. I get a lot of questions just around the brand and the ability to kind of travel, as you kind of referred to earlier, Carla, can the brand succeed in multiple categories? What gives you kind of confidence that, that is the case? And as you think about the portfolio longer term, and I know it's early days for you still, do you see more addition or more kind of subtraction in terms of the reach of the brand across categories, at least to the best that you can kind of speak to that today?Carla VernonThank you, Jon. I am so happy to talk about this subject because my time at Annie's was a really great experience for me to understand, when you build a brand where the consumer has adopted and internalized the purpose of the brand, the benefits and the values of the brand, then the brand has a lot of license to take those benefits and those values across categories where that is relevant. And so far, Honest is a brand built on a number of values, obviously, clean formulations, high-quality ingredients and input, products where you can believe the quality is worth the value that you are paying for them as well as something that was always important to our founder, Jessica, and remains true for our company today, Honest is a brand that needs to speak to all consumers, all demographics, all cultural groups, all life stages. And that's really sort of (inaudible) unique DNA, because we were built in modern times by a like thoroughly modern set of founders. And those [trues] are the thing we bring with us as we expand Honest into more categories. So I'm extremely confident that the shoulders of Honest are broad, that the shoulders of Honest are strong to bear the weight of many categories, and that there are categories waiting for Honest's values to come in and energize the category and change what consumers think they can expect from the category. I think our consumption growth and our distribution growth tells us that this is a brand that is still on the upswing, and our conversations with our retail partners let us know that this is a brand that they love to partner with to drive more growth.OperatorThank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back to Carla for closing remarks.Carla VernonEveryone, I can't thank you enough. I do want to extend my thanks to my team as well. It's a real honor and privilege to join The Honest family, and I thank you for your interest and support in The Honest Company. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.Inflation is finally showing signs of cooling off. The CPI report for February was in-line with expectations, with the all-items index rising 6% year over year. We also received a positive surprise after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a better than expected PPI report that shows the producer price index falling 0.1% in February from where it was in January. We also received a negative revision of 0.4% for the PPI data reported in January, now showing that the PPI for the month increased by 0.3% and not 0.7%.""If They Suddenly Go Zero, It Could Worry The Market""The economic data at hand and the implosion of SVB have been received by the markets to price in a 25 basis point rate hike at the next FOMC meeting. On March 16 Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at Wharton, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his view of what the Fed will do, and also what he thinks the Fed should do at the March meeting. Professor Siegel noted that he has been critical of Fed policy since the last 3 quarters and thinks that the situation at Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) and the implosion of SVB might give the Fed a reality check and redirect their focus from fighting inflation to preventing an economic downturn.Professor Siegel thinks that the Fed should not raise rates at the March meeting and he also noted that they should not have raised rates in January either. Professor Siegel noted that the Fed should have redirected their focus earlier on preventing a slowdown, instead of combating inflation. According to professor Siegel the Fed should not raise rates. However, he expects a quarter point rate hike at the March meeting, but with a relatively dovish tone. Professor Siegel expects a 25 bps rate hike because if the Fed abruptly stops its hiking cycle ""it could worry the market"" and so ""a more measured way of doing it is 25 (bps) with a pause"".Story continuesThe stock market is increasingly volatile right now, as the ramifications of SVB have spelled trouble for the global banking industry and inflation remains hot.

27,ec00271f-2ba5-3471-8296-51ff77450d40,MET,2023-03-17,12 Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-biggest-health-insurance-companies-142616788.html,1678976776,STORY,"['CVS', 'MUV2.DE', 'HUM', 'AXAHY', 'MET-PE', 'UNH', 'ELV']","[In this article, we discuss the 12 biggest health insurance companies in the world. If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out the 5 Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the World.According to Allied Market Research, the size of the global healthcare insurance industry stood at $1.98 trillion at the end of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased demand for health insurance around the world. The size of the industry is expected to compound annually at an average rate of 9.7% to reach $4.15 trillion by 2028. People consider health insurance services as an integral tool to share medical costs during accidents, illnesses, and injuries. The impact of the delay in routine healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic played favorably for health insurance companies. However, this effect was also offset by the increase in demand for COVID-19-related testing and treatment claims.The Protection Gap: Addressing Economic Losses in Health Insurance and BeyondExperts believe that health insurance companies that can innovate and transform their offerings according to customers' demands will be able to grow during these uncertain times. The uncertainty related to geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook has made business stability the top priority amongst health insurance companies such as Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV).In addition, the protection gap is growing with every passing day as the insurance related to natural disasters, cyber attacks, and health, only partially covers the actual economic losses related to these events. For instance, in 2019, more than 400 natural disaster events resulted in an economic loss of $232 billion, but only $71 billion of the loss was insured. This gap is expected to increase as the global population and life expectancy rise. These factors would provide the health insurance industry with a bigger market to target.Story continuesAccording to the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry could increase its bottom line by $60 - $80 billion annually if it works on reducing the insurance protection gaps. As of 2021, the global insurance protection gap stood at $1.4 trillion, while the global health protection gap was estimated at $737 billion. Experts believe the higher government spending on healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic helped reduce the health protection gap; however, it is expected to increase again as the pandemic has eased and governments around the world are shifting their focus towards other activities. Experts also highlight the low level of insurance literacy as a major challenge in gaining widespread market penetration. According to research conducted by French insurer SCOR, a significant number of people do not purchase insurance because they cannot comprehend the terms and conditions. The study comprised 12,000 consumers from around the world. Governments, regulators, insurance companies, and employers must come together to address the challenges to boost the adoption of health insurance.12 Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the Worldnational-cancer-institute-GcrSgHDrniY-unsplashOur MethodologyWe carried out thorough research utilizing a variety of dependable sources, including company and industry reports and financial databases, to determine the largest health insurance companies in the world. We took into account pertinent aspects, like the company's consumer base, product offerings, business models, and global reach, to assess its scale of operations. The companies have been ranked in ascending order of their trailing twelve months (ttm) revenue. The list includes both private and public limited companies.Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the World12. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)TTM Total Revenue:  $68.95 billion  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is a New York-based provider of annuities, employee benefit programs, and insurance. The company provides a wide range of health insurance products like accident insurance, disability and absence services, hospital indemnity, critical illness, and cancer insurance.In a research note issued on January 6, Jimmy Bhullar at JPMorgan increased the target price for MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) from $77 to $80 and maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. The analyst anticipates the company’s life and health insurance segment to perform well in 2023 as the benchmark interest rates are expected to rise further. However, this could be offset by a weak economy that could dent demand along with a higher risk of credit losses.11. Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in München (MUV2.DE)TTM Total Revenue: $71.50 billion (€67.09 billion)Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in München (MUV2.DE), more commonly known as Munich Re Group, is a German insurance company established in 1880.

While preserving and reinforcing the core of its business model, the company aims to drive the transition towards new business models. The company plans to enhance its market position in Germany and achieve profitable growth in international business, B2B operations, and direct customer offerings.10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) [ Owner of Aetna]TTM Total Revenue (Aetna):  $82.2 billion CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based healthcare company that is also a provider of health insurance services.The company acquired Aetna in 2018 to expand its presence in the health insurance segment. Based on 2021 total health plan enrollments, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) secured the sixth position with 2,574,348 enrollments. In a note issued to investors on February 9, Brian Tanquilut at Jefferies increased the target price for CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) from $130 to $143 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock following the strong Q4 2022 results. The company also disclosed that it intends to acquire Chicago, Illinois-based healthcare company Oak Street Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSH) for a sum of $10.6 billion. The analyst anticipates the earnings from Oak Street to contribute towards the company’s bottom-line growth after 2024.Vltava Fund shared its outlook on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”10. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)TTM Total Revenue:  $92.87 billion Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based health insurance company founded in 1961.The corporation occupies the 114th position on the 2023 America's Best Large Employers list curated by Forbes.

(NYSE:HUM) is the 11th biggest health insurance company in the US, with an enrollment of 887,612 members. Following the Q4 2022 results, George Hill at Deutsche Bank assigned Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) stock a target price of $562 along with a Buy rating on February 28. The analyst highlighted the company’s decision to exit the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business company. The business segment included the Federal Employee health benefit plans and rewards programs that are fully insured and self-funded.Here's what Renaissance Investment Management said about Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In September, We added a new position in the Health Care sector with Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), one of the largest managed care providers in the U.S. with a focus on medical insurance for the Medicare Advantage market. We believe Humana is poised to see a reacceleration in Medicare Advantage membership growth after making large investments in its program benefits earlier this year. In addition, we like the demographic tailwinds for the entire Medicare Advantage market, as the next four years should provide the highest number of baby boomers yet qualifying for Medicare benefits.”9.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) share price has soared 234% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. In contrast, the stock has fallen 9.2% in the last 30 days. This could be related to the soft market, with stocks down around 6.6% in the last month.While the stock has fallen 6.5% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Gartner To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Gartner was able to grow its EPS at 58% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 50% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Gartner's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Gartner shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 7.2% over one year. However, that falls short of the 21% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Gartner (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and troubles at Credit Suisse Group AG drove investors from risk assets, with oil-options covering accelerating the selloff.“Crude action this week reminded many of how quickly the commodity can be decimated by macro economic events,” said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth. “The commodity broke a significant level of support as the market tries to quantify the economic ramifications of banking turmoil.”Traders had been waiting for a catalyst to break prices out of the relatively narrow trading range that has dominated the market as expectations for rebounding Chinese demand compete with weaker economic outlook in the West.This week’s banking crisis provided the spark, driving oil prices to a 15-month low. That plunge triggered another: Prices went so low that 43,000 options contracts totaling more than 40 million barrels of crude came “into the money,” resulting in a tidy payday for some while at the same time further deepening the downturn.Oil’s next leg may depend on decisions by the US Federal Reserve and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Fed will decide next week whether to raise rates again, a move that has implications for oil demand. Meanwhile, OPEC and its allies will convene April 3 to revisit the group’s production policy. Several technical measures suggest that the recent plunge has pushed the commodity into oversold territory.Story continuesElements, Bloomberg’s daily energy and commodities newsletter, is now available.

The small cap Russell 2000 took the day's biggest losses, falling more than 2.5% as the index's weight toward regional banks — which stands at about 16% — put the index under heavier pressure than its larger peers.The bulk of Friday's selling pressure came in the financial sector, with shares of First Republic falling 33% after getting a lifeline from its larger industry peers on Thursday.Regional banks continued to face the most pressure, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 6% on Friday.Major money center banks like JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) all fell more than 3% on Friday. Over the last month, shares of Wells Fargo and Bank of America have lost more than 20%; the KRE regional banking ETF has lost closer to 30% over that period.Stocks rallied sharply on Thursday after news broke big banks led by JPMorgan and Bank of America were set to infuse First Republic with capital in what amounted to an industry bailout of the struggling bank.The firms eventually announced their deal to backstop First Republic about a half hour before the market close. Speaking with Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, longtime banking analyst Dick Bove said following these moves the near-term banking crisis is ""over."" Friday's market action suggested concerns from investors remain into the weekend over the longer-run prospects of these firms.Story continuesAfter opening lower on Friday, investors reacted positively to the day's biggest economic data point — the preliminary read on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan — which showed inflation expectations falling to the lowest level since April 2021.The report also noted its survey was 85% complete at the time of Silicon Valley Bank's failure, meaning initial reactions to that event from consumers won't roll in until later this month.First Republic Bank headquarters is seen on March 16, 2023 in San Francisco, California, United States. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Investors were also tracking the price of crude oil, with WTI crude down losing more than 3.1% to settle at $66.19 a barrel, a roughly 15-month low as oil prices have come under heavy pressure in the last week amid supply concerns and worries about a global economic slowdown.A rally in the dollar and gold this week spurred by investors seeking safe havens amid banking system worries also pressured oil prices.The Treasury market also remained a source of investor stress with the 10-year yield settling just under 3.4% on Friday, a precipitous drop from the 4% level seen just last week.In a note to clients on Thursday, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group highlighted how some of the recent volatility in the Treasury market — in particular with shorter-dated Treasuries that tend to be more sensitive to Fed expectations — has likely come from ""forced (that is, non-discretionary) buying and selling, and the prices that price-insensitive buyers or sellers agree to are not necessarily incorporating all information available.""""Another example is the massive inflow of cash to money market funds this week reported by ICI: total fund assets rose by 2.5% or $121bn, and money funds are forced to put that cash to work adding to short-term interest rate buying pressure,"" the firm wrote. ""Collapsing bill yields and very high volatility are consistent with the idea that the money fund flows are forcing purchases in specific markets.""In a note to clients on Friday, Thomas Mathews, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, echoed this view, noting the front-end of the Treasury curve now implies the Fed's benchmark interest rate ending 2023 about 2 percentage points below where investors expected just a week ago.""There's a good chance, in our view, that investors are now underestimating how much central bankers will raise rates over the next couple of months,"" Mathews wrote. ""As such, we suspect the rally in short-dated bonds could go into reverse.""The Fed will announce its next policy decision on Wednesday, March 22, with investors pricing in a roughly 60% chance the central bank raises rates by another 0.25%, according to data from the CME Group.Friday's close also marked a reshuffle in some sectors of the S&amp;P 500, with S&amp;P reclassifying 14 stocks in the index into new sectors as of today's close.The most notable names on the move include Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), and Dollar Tree (DLTR), which will move from the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) sector to Consumer Staples (XLP). Other notable companies moving sectors include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and PayPal (PYPL), which will move from Technology (XLK) into Financials (XLF).Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The rest are rated a sell. In blunt terms, analysts are saying to stay involved (or ""constructive,"" as the Wall Street jargon goes) in financials despite meltdowns in Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), and growing stress at Credit Suisse (CS).Parsed another way, 48% of the stocks are rated a buy, 44% are rated a hold, and 8% are rated a sell. The percentage of buy-rated financials has only declined by four percentage points since Feb. 28 despite the rolling banking crisis.Little too bullish on the financials?For perspective, the KBW Bank ETF (^BKX) has shed 25% in the last month, compared to a 5% drop for the S&amp;P 500, per Yahoo Finance data.Analysts are almost as bullish on the financials as the industrials (which aren't in crisis mode) — with the latter having 49% of its stocks in the S&amp;P 500 rated a buy.Going one step further, the financials are being modeled by analysts to report strong 9.4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter — which will capture the effects of the current crisis as the quarter ends on March 31. If somehow hit, the revenue growth rate for the financials would be the quickest pace of growth among all S&amp;P 500 sectors, notes FactSet.Bottom line: Clients could be left holding the bag if analysts don't step up and change their tune on financials.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 1.76% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 3.03%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the investment bank had lost 15.31% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's loss of 11.12% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.94% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Morgan Stanley as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 19, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.76, down 14.56% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $14.13 billion, down 4.56% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.21 per share and revenue of $56.32 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.36% and +4.95%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Morgan Stanley. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

That's according to the ""Wall Street Journal"". Well, joining us now is Innes McFee, Oxford Economics chief global economist and managing director of Macroeconomic and Investor Services. Great to have you on this show. Obviously, a lot to untangle here, so we're going to first start with what we're seeing with some of the growth or at least some of the improvement that we've seen with regional bank stocks on this report from the ""Wall Street Journal"". So how much does this speak to this not being a systemic issue then once you see these isolated issues that we saw with SVB and Signature Bank?INNES MCFEE: Well, certainly I think the thing is that so far what we're seeing is a number of different idiosyncratic problems and that's created what I would describe as a bit of a panic at the moment. Regulators, policymakers in general are now responding to that offering liquidity, helping to calm the market a bit. And so far you've seen a bit of a relief rally. Clearly, there's still a lot of tricky days to navigate ahead, not least the big monetary policy decisions that we've got coming up in the coming days.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So what do we think is the best and worst case scenario, when you look at that fallout and then add to it what we're seeing across with Credit Suisse as well?INNES MCFEE: Well, I think best case scenario is really one in which central banks step in, and provide a lot of liquidity, and really make clear that they're going to backstop all the liquidity that's required both for the big institutions, but also for the smaller institutions which, of course, are really important, particularly in the US for lending to all sorts of sectors but particularly commercial property. And then I think that would help to just really bolster confidence and allow financial conditions to, kind of, ease from where they are today. The worst case scenario is really one in which you don't see an overwhelming response from policymakers, one in which these concerns persist and rumble on, financial conditions remain tight, and that feeds into lending standards. And then ultimately, that translates into a lack of supply of credit for the economy and it pushes us into a recession.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: So Innes, I want to now focus on Credit Suisse. They got that $54 billion emergency liquidity from the Swiss central bank. Gives them some breathing room, but doesn't take away from some of the underlying problems the bank already had to get it into this position. So is that the right move? Is this a situation where they had no choice but to act?INNES MCFEE: Well, then if they didn't have a choice, but I think it's certainly positive that they've done so. It certainly allows them breathing room like you say. I think the issues at Credit Suisse, which are well known about, are very different from those of SVB or most other banks. It's really about the business model and how they react and restructure the business and move their way into better profitability.I think it's also fair to say that, from what we know, the Credit Suisse balance sheet looks very strong, including with a lot of liquidity. So it's a good vote of confidence from policymakers, which hopefully gives them that breathing room, as you say, to help try and tackle some of the longer-term issues, which really they're not the, sort of, things that you can just make an announcement and then it's going to divert market attention. Really, we're talking about big structural strategic changes to the way that bank operates.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And then as we've had a lot of people make comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. Also, even Elon Musk tweeting about comparisons to the 1929 bank run as well. But I want to ask you about this tweet from Nouriel Roubini. Granted, he's known as Dr. Doom, so you knew it was going to be something on the more negative side.But he said, ""the Credit Suisse crisis is a 'Lehman moment' for the European and global markets. Too big to fail and too big to be saved. It's not even clear what their various unrealized losses on securities and other assets are."" Is Credit Suisse too big to fail and too big to save? And is it even fair to call this a Lehman moment?INNES MCFEE: I'm not sure it is to be honest. I think, clearly, 2008 was a very, very different set of events. We had a big deterioration in the real economy. We had losses that people weren't clear about how they-- where they were distributed around the banking sector, who was exposed to who, those sorts of things.Now we are really in a world where we've got a lot more financial stability tools. We really spent the last 15 years thinking about how banks can fail, particularly big ones, how to resolve them. And it's just not-- I don't think it's really a fair comparison at all really.I think we'll, ultimately, see how financial conditions play out in the coming months, how the central banks will react to them. But fundamentally, when you think about the fundamentals of the real economy, there isn't a sign that there's a huge amount of leverage around, there isn't a sign of huge excess, imbalances. So whilst we think that the US, for example, will head into recession in the second half of the year, it will be a pretty mild one. And when you think about what that implies for bank losses, it's a completely different scenario from that 2008 now.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then as we take that look that-- take that view, obviously, what we're seeing now with the banks, seeing that it's not systemic-- I mean, US Treasury still keeping an eye on this-- what are your expectations then for the rest of the year as, sort of, the reverberations continue to play out?INNES MCFEE: Well, I think the first thing to say is that we've already seen a tightening in financial conditions come through and that play through really from the tightening in monetary policies that we saw already last year. So we know monetary policy acts with the lag. We know that that's taken a while to get into financial conditions. We're starting to see it in terms of lending to the real economy. And that's particularly true in the eurozone, for example.If this episode rumbles on, it really means that we're going to see more and more pressure on the supply of credit to the real economy, potentially also demand as well. And then that will start to have an impact on real economy, we think, towards the end of 2023, certainly the second half. So to the extent that this episode really means a doubling down on those tightening of credit conditions, then you can expect a worse outcome in the real economy. But for now, we're certainly sticking to our view that we'll see a relatively mild recession in the US. We'll see Europe and the UK largely avoid recession.]"

(NYSE: FE), today requested a review of its base electric rates by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). The proposed rate adjustment supports an approximately $185 million investment that strengthens the energy grid, enhances the customer experience and funds new low-income and senior citizen customer assistance programs.JCP&amp;L Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Upon approval of the base rate adjustment, JCP&amp;L customers would continue to pay the lowest residential electric rates among New Jersey's four regulated electric distribution companies. The typical JCP&amp;L residential customer, using 780 kilowatt hours per month, would see a 7.5% percent overall rate increase – or $8.45 monthly.""Our proposal balances our need to invest in a safe, reliable and modern grid while keeping rates affordable for our customers,"" said Jim Fakult, president of New Jersey operations for FirstEnergy. ""This plan keeps JCP&amp;L's rates the lowest in the state and offers additional assistance to our customers facing financial hardship.""Since its last rate review in 2020, JCP&amp;L has made more than $794 million in investments to modernize and strengthen its electric grid.  These investments help to reduce the size and length of power outages. They include the installation of devices that can sense an outage and automatically transfer customers onto an adjacent circuit limiting the number of customers that experience a long-duration outage, upgrades to company substations in Monmouth, Ocean and Morris counties that provide for additional capacity and redundancy and expansion of a substation to accommodate significant growth in electric demand in Ocean County. Approval of the Company's proposal would help ensure investments that modernize and strengthen the grid continue.Story continuesIn addition, the rate review proposes the launch of two new customer assistance initiatives. A Senior Citizens Discount Program would provide income-eligible seniors with a discount on JCP&amp;L's distribution charges averaging $15 monthly, applied as a credit on the monthly bill for their primary residence. In addition, an Energy Assistance Outreach Team will be created to enhance the Company's ongoing efforts to increase awareness, education and participation in energy assistance programs available to eligible customers.Because falling trees and tree limbs remain a leading cause of power outages, the proposal also includes an increase of more than $10 million per year in the Company's budget to maintain trees located outside of company rights-of-way that pose a threat to power lines. The funding would also allow removal of additional trees damaged by the emerald ash borer that are a potential threat to power lines.The filing also includes the recovery of costs incurred by JCP&amp;L from the impact of major storms, including Tropical Storm Isaias, the remnants of Hurricane Ida, 2021's bow echo, Winter Storms Zeta and Elliott and other weather-related events. JCP&amp;L has taken steps to reduce this balance, such as applying proceeds from its sale of the Yards Creek Pumped-Storage Generating Facility.Other items supported by the rate review include a program to begin transitioning streetlights from outdated, costly sodium vapor lights to energy efficient LED streetlights, with optional smart features that give municipalities more control of the fixtures. Costs associated with the transition to a new ""smart electric meter"" system and JCP&amp;L's electric vehicle charging program, which are designed to support the state's clean energy goals, are also included in the submission.JCP&amp;L serves 1.1 million customers in the counties of Burlington, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union, and Warren.

53,215776a0-7ddd-3325-b070-e633f39e94ae,RL,2023-03-17,Here's Why You Should Invest in Crocs (CROX) Right Away,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-invest-crocs-crox-141102980.html,1678975862,STORY,"['HRB', 'DECK', 'RL']","[Crocs CROX appears to be a lucrative pick for investors as the company boasts solid consumer demand in the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands, as well as strength in clogs, sandals and Jibbitz categories. This led to the robust fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the eleventh straight quarter in the fourth quarter.Adjusted earnings were $2.65 per share, rising 23.3% from $2.15 in the year-ago period. Revenues advanced 61.1% (or 64.8% on a constant-currency basis) year over year to $945.2 million in the reported quarter, driven by growth across all regions and channels.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have outperformed the industry and the overall Consumer Discretionary sector in the past month. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 25.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.1% and against the sector’s decline of 1.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThat said, let’s delve into the factors that make Crocs a promising bet.What’s Driving CROX?Its previously acquired HEYDUDE, which sells lightweight, casual shoes and sandals for men, women and children, bodes well. This is the second high-growth and highly profitable brand added to the Crocs portfolio. HEYDUDE’s consumer-insight-driven casual, comfortable and lightweight products perfectly fit CROX’s existing portfolio. The acquisition is likely to diversify Crocs’ brand portfolio and add to its digital penetration, as HEYDUDE already has a strong online presence.Notably, the HEYDUDE brand’s fourth-quarter revenues advanced 37% year over year to $279.2 million. For 2023, revenues related to the HEYDUDE buyout are likely to grow in the mid-20% range on a reported basis. Management expects the HEYDUDE brand to attain $1 billion in revenues in 2023.Crocs has been making significant progress in expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities. Digital sales advanced 80% year over year in the fourth quarter, marking significant growth from the prior-year quarter’s 41%. The metric represented 45.1% of the total revenues, up from the prior-year quarter’s figure of 40.3%. This was mainly driven by brand strength, new products, refined user experience and marketing activities. Increased focus on the Crocs mobile app and global social platforms aided digital sales. Gains from strategic collaborations, influencer campaigns, and digital and social marketing efforts remained upsides.CROX is on track with its long-term strategy and key initiatives to deliver sustainable growth. It expects to generate revenues of more than $5 billion by 2026, witnessing compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 17% in the next five years. The company expects to attain the revenue target, driven by strong digital sales, improved market share for sandals, growth in Asia, and innovative product and marketing. Management expects four times revenue growth in sandals by 2026.The company sees long-term opportunities in Asia, primarily in China, which is the second-largest footwear market in the world. Management expects revenue growth to witness a CAGR of 25% and represent 24% of the total revenues in 2026. The company targets at least 50% of total revenues to come from digital channels by the end of 2026. Driven by strong revenue growth, the company anticipates improved profitability and cash flows through 2026. It expects an adjusted operating margin of more than 26% and annual free cash flow in excess of $1 billion by the end of 2026.Driven by these factors, along with the impressive quarterly results, management issued upbeat guidance for 2023. For 2023, revenues are anticipated to grow 10-13% to $3.9-$4 billion. Brand-wise, Crocs’ revenues are anticipated to be 6-8% on a reported basis and 9-11% on a cc basis. Meanwhile, HEYDUDE’s revenues are predicted to grow in the mid-20% range on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings are envisioned at $11-$11.31 per share, with an adjusted operating margin of 26%.For first-quarter 2023, revenues are expected to grow 27-30% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of $660.1 million. Adjusted earnings are forecast to be $2.06-$2.19 per share and the adjusted operating margin is likely to be 24-25%.Story continuesBottom LineAlthough inflation and elevated freight costs remain looming concerns, we believe that online strength, solid demand and well-chalked-out endeavors will help Crocs sustain its stellar show. Also, a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% and a VGM Score of A reflect its inherent strength. Topping it, earnings estimates for the current financial year have increased 4.7% to $11.19 over the past 30 days.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, H&amp;R Block HRB and Deckers Outdoor DECK.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

It creates brand new content - a text, an image, even computer code - based on that training, instead of simply categorizing or identifying data like other AI.The most famous generative AI application is ChatGPT, a chatbot that Microsoft-backed OpenAI released late last year. The AI powering it is known as a large language model because it takes in a text prompt and from that writes a human-like response.GPT-4, a newer model that OpenAI announced this week, is ""multimodal"" because it can perceive not only text but images as well. OpenAI's president demonstrated on Tuesday how it could take a photo of a hand-drawn mock-up for a website he wanted to build, and from that generate a real one.WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?Demonstrations aside, businesses are already putting generative AI to work.The technology is helpful for creating a first-draft of marketing copy, for instance, though it may require cleanup because it isn't perfect. One example is from CarMax Inc , which has used a version of OpenAI's technology to summarize thousands of customer reviews and help shoppers decide what used car to buy.Generative AI likewise can take notes during a virtual meeting. It can draft and personalize emails, and it can create slide presentations. Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google each demonstrated these features in product announcements this week.WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?Nothing, although there is concern about the technology's potential abuse.School systems have fretted about students turning in AI-drafted essays, undermining the hard work required for them to learn. Cybersecurity researchers have also expressed concern that generative AI could allow bad actors, even governments, to produce far more disinformation than before.Story continuesAt the same time, the technology itself is prone to making mistakes. Factual inaccuracies touted confidently by AI, called ""hallucinations,"" and responses that seem erratic like professing love to a user are all reasons why companies have aimed to test the technology before making it widely available.IS THIS JUST ABOUT GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT?Those two companies are at the forefront of research and investment in large language models, as well as the biggest to put generative AI into widely used software such as Gmail and Microsoft Word. But they are not alone.Large companies like Salesforce Inc as well as smaller ones like Adept AI Labs are either creating their own competing AI or packaging technology from others to give users new powers through software.HOW IS ELON MUSK INVOLVED?He was one of the co-founders of OpenAI along with Sam Altman. But the billionaire left the startup's board in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest between OpenAI's work and the AI research being done by Telsa Inc - the electric-vehicle maker he leads.Musk has expressed concerns about the future of AI and batted for a regulatory authority to ensure development of the technology serves public interest.""It's quite a dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it,"" he said towards the end of Tesla Inc's Investor Day event earlier this month.""Tesla's doing good things in AI, I don't know, this one stresses me out, not sure what more to say about it.""

This is what he likes insteadThe failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have spooked depositors and investors. While regulators quickly stepped in to assure that the deposits are safe, Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary was not impressed.“What effectively happened over the weekend is that he nationalized the American banking system,” he told CNN, referring to U.S. President Joe Biden. “It's no longer a risk. It's no longer private in any sense. It is now backstopped by the government, ultimately the taxpayer.”Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classOwning real estate for passive income is one of the biggest investing myths — but it can work if you're smart. Find out how in 2 easy stepsAccording to O’Leary, this should change how investors view the sector.“What’s really happening when the President steps out in a few moments is he's basically saying, ‘look, I can't take this risk anymore, I'm just going to nationalize the whole thing’,” O’Leary said, adding that as banks become more regulated as they get more concentrated, they would be “far less profitable.”And that does not bode well for shareholders.“There’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this is going to be very expensive for shareholders of banks long term. I would never put my money into a bank stock ever again.”So where does Mr. Wonderful put his money?Dividend stocksO’Leary is a believer in investing in dividend stocks.“When I started to do some research I found out one interesting fact that changed my investment philosophy forever,” he said in a Forbes interview. “Over the last 40 years, 71% of the market returns came from dividends, not capital appreciation.”“So rule one for me is I’ll never own stuff that doesn’t pay a dividend.

You could also ask Copilot to rate how the meeting went. The chatbot can also create a first draft of a PowerPoint, and can pull information from documents you drop into the interface. There are also options to draft text that is “fun” or “minimal,” among other styles.The chatbot “will fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a statement.The AI-powered assistant is built on OpenAI’s technology, a large language model, combined with Microsoft’s apps that contain vast amounts of information on its users.Microsoft said Copilot is currently in test mode and that it will preview the product more broadly in coming months.The new rollouts come after Microsoft had announced a $10 billion investment into OpenAI, the startup behind generative AI tools ChatGPT and Dall-e, earlier this year.The world of office productivity toolsMicrosoft is not the first tech company to roll out a tool aimed to help workers be more productive. Think: Slack, Notion, Asana, Airtable, the list goes on. Just last week, Salesforce announced it will integrate ChatGPT into Slack.The idea that Microsoft’s chatbot can ease a writer’s block when it comes to creating drafts pushes the envelope, as it won’t merely help with organizing tasks, but also fulfilling them. Whether these tools will ultimately succeed in making people more productive, however, remains to be seen.Story continuesBig Tech’s AI raceAlong with the ambitious bet that AI will transform work, Microsoft was quick to say it will be collecting user feedback to improve on the tool. “We’re going to make mistakes,” admitted Jaime Teevan, the chief data scientist at Microsoft, in a livestream on Thursday.In recent weeks, a string of tech giants announced how they’re adding generative AI—the label for technology that generates new content like text, visuals, code—to their software. Google said it was bringing AI chat to Gmail and Docs, after having rolled out Bard, the rival Microsoft’s AI bing. Amazon has partnered with startup Hugging Face to create generative AI applications. And, just this week, nimble startup OpenAI announced a more advanced version of ChatGPT.The speed at which these tools are released, and the warning about mistakes, suggests tech companies have rediscovered their appetite to move fast and break things.Related stories💻 Microsoft spent over a decade on the new Bing.

We note that bridal overall, inclusive of engagements, historically reflects nearly 47-49% of the company’s merchandise sales in the past five years.It expects a certain shift in consumer discretionary spending from the jewelry category with the decelerating consumer confidence and pent-up demand for experience-oriented categories.

WBA is gaining from continued partnership growth and a strong focus on strategic execution. The recent product launch looks encouraging. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 29.3% compared with a 3.8% fall of the industry and an 13% plunge of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $28.92 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 4.72% on average. However, the company’s long-term projected growth rate of 5% remains behind the industry’s growth projection of 6.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayNew Alliances Look Strategic: The intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships.In Novemeber 2022, VillageMD entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Summit Health-CityMD — a leading provider of primary, specialty and urgent care. With Investments from WBA and Evernorth, the Combined Company Will Deliver a Unique and Comprehensive Patient Experience for Optimal Individual and Community Outcomes.In October 2022, Walgreens Boots announced the acceleration of its plans to acquire full ownership of CareCentrix, expanding its reach into the growing homecare sector and advancing its healthcare long-term growth strategy.Product Launches: During the first quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings update, Walgreens noted that it had launched 24-hour same-day delivery, offering the widest range of retail items for around-the-clock delivery nationwide. This adds to the company’s broad range of channel access, including one-hour delivery and 30-minute pickup.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn June 2022, Walgreens launched its clinical trial business to redefine the patient experience and bolster access and retention in sponsor-led drug development research. Through this launch, Walgreens aims to enhance participation, especially among diverse populations, while supporting sponsors in meeting the trial goals.Story continuesLong-Term Growth Model Looks Encouraging:  During the first-quarter-fiscal 2023 earnings call, Walgreens Boots noted that U.S. Healthcare targets raised with Summit Health announcement on November 7, 2022, including the fiscal year 2025 sales goal to $14.5 billion to $16.0 billion, up from $11.0 billion to $12.0 billion previously, and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the segment by the end of the fiscal year 2023.Looking beyond 2023, the company increased clarity into the long-term growth algorithm, building to low-teens adjusted EPS growth in the fiscal year 2025 and beyond.DownsidesPressure on Margin Continues: In the last few years, the slowdown in the generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. Of late, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margins on a significant level.Competitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds from increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has been constant at $4.50.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $134.51 billion, suggesting a 1.4% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector include Haemonetics Corporation HAE, TerrAscend Corp.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.

The company is facing the heat due to the escalation in fuel costs, as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us.

The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front.In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.

68,7338d692-473f-31e7-83ce-5cbb774b627a,SBUX,2023-03-17,Joe & The Juice aspires to be the Starbucks of juice without losing the ride-or-die culture that sets it apart,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/joe-juice-aspires-starbucks-juice-123000844.html,1678969800,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Being a juicer isn’t just a job—it’s a lifestyle. That’s the Joe &amp; The Juice motto.Valarie Simmonds, 27, bought into that lifestyle after graduating culinary school and working as an assistant pastry chef in Miami and New York. The culinary world was stressful and unrelenting; Simmonds says she felt lost and unsure about what she wanted to do with her life when Joe came along.She was drawn in after watching videos of Joe &amp; The Juice founder, Kaspar Basse, talking about Joe’s purpose and his hope that people who didn’t know what they wanted to do in life would find meaning.Being a juicer at Joe &amp; The Juice, the upstart fast-casual juice bar and coffee shop with aspirations of competing with Starbucks, helped coax Simmonds out of her shell. She barely spoke when she started working behind the bar, she says, but her managers hyped her up and pushed her to be more outgoing. She says they helped her to learn from mistakes, express herself, and to compete.That’s the culture of Joe &amp; The Juice, which serves up coffee, juice, and sandwiches—including the TikTok famous Tunacado (iykyk)—with a dose of late-2010s exuberance. And Basse, who founded the company in Denmark in 2002, has more or less gotten out of the way and let it spring from the ground up.Basse doesn’t force manuals and uniforms on employees, instead encouraging individuality. With over 300 locations worldwide, each store is meant to take on the character of the managers and staff who work there. But as the chain continues to grow—Basse has a goal to expand by 60 to 70 stores in the U.S. alone in 2023—is it possible to maintain that culture?It was this spirited, inclusive culture that made Simmonds fall in love with Joe &amp; The Juice. There were game nights and events; they’d get together to play soccer and for running clubs, which helped her form relationships with coworkers. It was about more than the job—she and her coworkers loved Joe because it brought them together, she says.Story continuesThat’s not to say Joe &amp; the Juice’s culture is an accident. In a world where companies and organizations are consistently falling over themselves to instill some semblance of company culture, Basse did perhaps the most difficult thing and let the Joe &amp; The Juice vibe come organically through the people pouring the drinks.The culture is the juiceBasse wasn’t all that concerned with culture when he set out to create a fresh-squeezed juice empire some 20-plus years ago. That changed quickly, however, and now the Joe &amp; The Juice culture is all people seem to be able to talk about.“I would love to tell you that 20 years ago I figured out that [culture] is the one component that most companies can’t figure out, therefore I wanted to compete on that,” Basse tells Fortune during a recent interview via Zoom.  “But it actually was something that just came along… And luckily for me, quite early in our process.”Joe &amp; The Juice founder Kaspar Basse.Two years into running Joe &amp; The Juice, Basse needed someone to fill in while he attended his mother’s birthday party. He couldn’t afford to hire any other employees, but one of his first loyal customers, Philip Finsteen, offered to pitch in.As Joe &amp; The Juice legend has it, Finsteen tripled the store’s sales in a single day through sheer charisma. From then on, Basse turned his company’s focus to pushing people over products.Just as important to Joe’s culture as individuality, is the competitive nature—also arguably good for the bottom line. Juicers compete behind the bar. They have friendly competition with workers making sandwiches. Hell, they even hold company-wide competitions called “Showoffs,” where juicers twirl blender containers on their heads, pour juice into cups balanced on biceps, and breathe fire, all to a soundtrack of 808-bumping mixes that would give 2012’s Project X a run for its money—if the film centered around freshly squeezed organic juice instead of booze and girls.Basse is a former karate champion—and he resembles, tattoos and all, the bad guy honcho in a Karate Kid sequel. So it’s fitting that competitiveness sits at the core of the chain’s culture.Simmonds, and fellow New York regional manager Mohammad Haq, consider themselves beneficiaries of the culture Joe &amp; The Juice has engendered. Their roles are to hype up their juicers, making sure the vibe is right for business to thrive. They talk about Joe &amp; The Juice with a reverence and gratitude, as something that's changed their life—a company culture seemingly too good to be true in a cynically corporate world.For Valarie and Mohammad, working at Joe &amp; The Juice isn't really work.Haq, 24, starts every day checking in on the bar managers at his stores in the Financial District, making sure everything is in order, and the music is on point. I stopped by one of Haq’s stores near the Fortune office just after the lunch rush. A remix of “Love Language” by Australian band Crooked Colours seeped out of the speakers. I’d never heard the song before, but some employees bopped around to the music while cleaning and chatting with one another. The vibe seemed right.“When everything is working the way it should be in the [juice] bars, you can have fun, you can be curious about what's happening,” Haq says. “You can have that expectation that when you walk into the bar, and everything is the way it should be, that there is going to be that Joe vibe.”Putting culture on a cupVirtually all companies with lofty goals of growth and a competitive, cult-like spirit have had to grow up at some point. Will Joe? Will the guerilla juicery ever have to settle into homogeneity? Can it keep that Joe DNA while on Basse’s odyssey to build Joe &amp; The Juice into Starbucks without becoming Starbucks?The journey hasn’t been without its challenges. Two years into its U.S. foray, Joe &amp; The Juice was forced to contend with major questions about its culture. A sex discrimination suit was brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2017, asserting the company failed to hire and promote women at its American locations.Company representatives said in a statement that Joe &amp; The Juice has “always actively promoted gender equality. However, in recent years they have strived to meet the highest standards of inclusion in both their U.S. organization as well as globally.”The proportion of women in their U.S. business is currently 57%, which the company says exceeds its 53% global average. Among management, 55% of Joe’s senior managers are women and 43% are managers. “The brand looks forward to continuing to evolve and learn from the past,” reads the statement.Inside Joe &amp; The Juice.Joe &amp; The Juice paid $715,000 in February 2023 to settle that lawsuit. As part of the agreement, the company is under a four-year improvement plan to ensure equal access to promotions.In hopes of ensuring Joe &amp; The Juice holds on to some semblance of the free flowing, fire breathing individuality and culture that’s endeared it to its workforce and its viral charged fanbase, the company created its own version of a SWAT team, a mobile management team that travels to new locations and encourages juicers to latch onto that signature Joe DNA.Basse admits this had been a struggle as Joe expanded to its 64 U.S. locations. Representatives for the company say it’s managed to improve profitability since jumping the pond, pulling in some $70 million in revenue per year in the U.S.It’s abundantly clear Basse is wrestling with competitive ambitions and his passion for the culture: He wants to grow, but doesn’t want to risk spreading his people—the culture—too thin.“Everybody wants to be challenged. Everybody wants to be able to progress. Everybody wants to develop their social network. And, eventually, everybody wants to work for a company that does good in this world,” Basse says. “I am of the belief that these things are the same no matter where you approach the world. I think our model can be applied in Scandinavia, in the U.S., in India, in the Middle East—but that might just call for a little bit of patience.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

The company and state officials did not make the incident public until Thursday.“With no immediate safety risk, we focused on investigating the situation and containing the affected water in concert with our regulatory agencies,” company spokesperson Kevin Coss said in an emailed statement.The water’s tritium levels are below the commission’s safety thresholds, the company said, and monitoring wells have confirmed the leaked water has been contained to the plant site. Xcel has been pumping and processing the water and estimates it has recovered about 25% of the tritium released.Minnesota officials said in a press release the leak did not reach the Mississippi River or contaminate drinking water sources.Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen that produces low levels of radiation.

70,6c277964-8f8b-3327-8efa-6407b555e23b,XEL,2023-03-17,Regulators monitor tritium leak at Minnesota nuclear plant,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regulators-monitor-tritium-leak-minnesota-215538499.html,1679003738,STORY,['XEL'],"[ST.. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota regulators said Thursday they're monitoring the cleanup of a leak of 400,000 gallons of radioactive water from Xcel Energy's Monticello nuclear power plant, and the company said there's no danger to the public.“Xcel Energy took swift action to contain the leak to the plant site, which poses no health and safety risk to the local community or the environment,” the Minneapolis-based utility said in a statement.While Xcel reported the leak of water containing tritium to state and federal authorities in late November, the spill had not been made public before Thursday. State officials said they waited to get more information before going public with it.“We knew there was a presence of tritium in one monitoring well, however Xcel had not yet identified the source of the leak and its location,” Minnesota Pollution Control Agency spokesman Michael Rafferty said.“Now that we have all the information about where the leak occurred, how much was released into groundwater, and that contaminated groundwater had moved beyond the original location, we are sharing this information,"" he said, adding the water remains contained on Xcel's property and poses no immediate public health risk.The company said it notified the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the state on Nov. 22, the day after it confirmed the leak, which came from a pipe between two buildings. Since then, it has been pumping groundwater, storing and processing the contaminated water, which contains tritium levels below federal thresholds.“Ongoing monitoring from over two dozen on-site monitoring wells confirms that the leaked water is fully contained on-site and has not been detected beyond the facility or in any local drinking water,” the Xcel Energy statement said.When asked why Xcel Energy didn't notify the public earlier, the company said: “We understand the importance of quickly informing the communities we serve if a situation poses an immediate threat to health and safety. In this case, there was no such threat."" The company said it focused on investigating the situation, containing the affected water and figuring out next steps.Story continuesThe Monticello plant is about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, upstream from the city on the Mississippi River.Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the NRC. A person who drank water from a spill would get only a low dose, the NRC says.The NRC says tritium spills happen from time to time at nuclear plants, but that it has repeatedly determined that they've either remained limited to the plant property or involved such low offsite levels that they didn't affect public health or safety. Xcel reported a small tritium leak at Monticello in 2009.Xcel said it has recovered about 25% of the spilled tritium so far, that recovery efforts will continue and that it will install a permanent solution this spring.“While this leak does not pose a risk to the public or the environment, we take this very seriously and are working to safely address the situation,” Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, said in the statement. “We continue to gather and treat all potentially affected water while regularly monitoring nearby groundwater sources.”Xcel Energy is considering building above-ground storage tanks to store the contaminated water it recovers, and is considering options for the treatment, reuse, or final disposal of the collected tritium and water. State regulators will review the options the company selects, the MPCA said.Japan is preparing to release a massive amount of treated radioactive wastewater into the sea from the the triple reactor meltdowns 12 years ago at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The water contains tritium and other radioactive contaminants.]"

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Archer-Daniels-Midland's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Archer-Daniels-Midland is:18% = US$4.4b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, Archer-Daniels-Midland seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Archer-Daniels-Midland was able to see an impressive net income growth of 20% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Archer-Daniels-Midland's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.9% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ADM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Archer-Daniels-Midland has a three-year median payout ratio of 35% (where it is retaining 65% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Archer-Daniels-Midland is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Besides, Archer-Daniels-Midland has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 31% of its profits over the next three years. However, Archer-Daniels-Midland's future ROE is expected to decline to 10% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Archer-Daniels-Midland's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).26 Companies that Donate to NonprofitsPixabay/Public domainOur MethodologyWe started off by finding as many companies as we could with nonprofit donation initiatives.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for TransDigm Group TransDigm Group's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, TransDigm Group has grown EPS by 13% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. TransDigm Group shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 39% to 42%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for TransDigm Group.Are TransDigm Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of TransDigm Group, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$172m. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesIs TransDigm Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, TransDigm Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It is worth noting though that we have found 3 warning signs for TransDigm Group (2 are significant!) that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The rest are rated a sell. In blunt terms, analysts are saying to stay involved (or ""constructive,"" as the Wall Street jargon goes) in financials despite meltdowns in Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), and growing stress at Credit Suisse (CS).Parsed another way, 48% of the stocks are rated a buy, 44% are rated a hold, and 8% are rated a sell. The percentage of buy-rated financials has only declined by four percentage points since Feb. 28 despite the rolling banking crisis.Little too bullish on the financials?For perspective, the KBW Bank ETF (^BKX) has shed 25% in the last month, compared to a 5% drop for the S&amp;P 500, per Yahoo Finance data.Analysts are almost as bullish on the financials as the industrials (which aren't in crisis mode) — with the latter having 49% of its stocks in the S&amp;P 500 rated a buy.Going one step further, the financials are being modeled by analysts to report strong 9.4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter — which will capture the effects of the current crisis as the quarter ends on March 31. If somehow hit, the revenue growth rate for the financials would be the quickest pace of growth among all S&amp;P 500 sectors, notes FactSet.Bottom line: Clients could be left holding the bag if analysts don't step up and change their tune on financials.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.76%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 3.03%.Coming into today, shares of the investment bank had lost 16.6% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector lost 11.12%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 5.94%.Goldman Sachs will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 18, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $8.75, down 18.68% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.28 billion, up 2.69% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $33.14 per share and revenue of $50.37 billion. These totals would mark changes of +10.25% and +6.34%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.52% higher. Goldman Sachs is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note Goldman Sachs's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 9.42. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.22, so we one might conclude that Goldman Sachs is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that GS has a PEG ratio of 0.61. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Investment Bank industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.96 as of yesterday's close.The Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector.

If you want to see more best US stocks for foreigners, go directly to 5 Best US Stocks for Foreigners.Given the United States has the largest economy in the world, many foreigners invest in American stocks. Furthermore, many leading American companies are multinational, giving further geographic exposure and scale.The United States is also the home to the Federal Reserve, which is the world's leading central bank. Furthermore, it is home to Wall Street, which is the world's leading financial center.Although it is already one of the most developed countries in the world, the United States has a lot of growth potential in the future.For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.The United States has substantial population growth potential.The United States leads in AI which could help produce many innovative breakthroughs that increase domestic and potentially world GDP.Many multinational American companies also have substantial emerging market operations that could help with earnings growth in the future.Many leading American blue chips also pay a dividend and also buy back stock when they have excess capital.Near Term HeadwindsThe American economy is slowing currently.Recently, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank by assets in the country, failed in a few days given the bank failed to successfully raise enough equity that it needed and customers withdrew substantial deposits.Fearing contagion, the U.S. government stepped in to protect deposits at Silicon Valley Bank.CNBC said, ""Banking regulators devised a plan Sunday to backstop depositors with money at Silicon Valley Bank, a critical step in stemming a feared systemic panic brought on by the collapse of the tech-focused institution.""Although the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank are protected, the equity shareholders of the bank aren't and the failure worsened confidence in other banks, which could have ripple effects on U.S. economic growth.Story continuesWith the failure and the higher interest rates, there is potential for the U.S. economy to slow even further and as a result, the near term is pretty uncertain in the United States. Furthermore, if the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of stocks purchased in U.S. dollars could decrease, all else equal.Despite the near term headwinds which could lead to lower stock prices if economic data fails to meet expectations, the long term potential growth of leading blue chips in the United States is still pretty attractive. The United States has the world's leading economy, leads the world in innovation currently, and will likely remain the world's innovation leader in the future. With more innovation, there could be more total value created and many of today's leading blue chips in America could benefit as a result.For those of you interested check out 12 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy.Given individual companies can fail as Silicon Valley Bank showed and sectors can also underperform, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real Estate, InvestmentPhoto by Frans Ruiter on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners, we picked 15 stocks with competitive advantages that have headquarters in the United States and that are listed in either the NYSE or the NASDAQ.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners15. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is one of the biggest asset managers in the world that has a lot of scale and competitive advantages. Given the weaker market in 2022 and also dollar appreciation on average AUM, the company's full year revenue decreased 8% year over year and its full year operating income decreased 13% year over year as adjusted. Full year diluted EPS decreased 13% year over year as adjusted. While the near term could be uncertain this year, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has a very strong franchise and long term growth potential. Shares currently trade for a forward P/E of 15.98 as of March 14. Of the 943 hedge funds in our database, 49 owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q4.14. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the leading home improvement retailers in the world. While the company's customer base has been fairly resilient for most of fiscal 2022 with less price sensitivity than what would normally be expected given the persistent inflation, the company's fourth quarter 2022 comparables were slightly softer than anticipated. Given the rising interest rates and the potential for an economic slowdown, the company expects weaker demand in the near term as well. In February, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) said it saw FY23 revenue flat, and FY23 EPS down mid-single digits percentage range. Nevertheless, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has growth potential in the long term given the rising equity value of the total homes in the United States.13. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the leading discount retailers in the world with substantial scale. In fact, as of the end of FY2022, the company operated 10,635 total retail units globally, with 4,717 Walmart stores in the United States and 5,318 Walmart International stores. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) also had 600 Sam's Club stores in the United States. With its scale, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been able to invest in technology and bargain with suppliers to offer its consumers very competitive prices and still realize substantial profits. For FY23, which is the 52 week period ending January 27, 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) had adjusted EPS of $6.29 and the company returned $16 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.12. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a leading home improvement retailer that like The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is facing near term softness in demand. In Q4 2022, for instance, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)'s comparable sales declined 0.7% year over year and the company sees FY23 comparable sales flat to down 2% year over year. While the company thinks there could be a 'slight decline' in the home improvement market in 2023, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) believes the long term outlook for the home improvement market is still strong given aging homes and the rising value of total homes.11. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a leading sport apparel maker that has faced headwinds such as foreign exchange and inventory challenges in the near term. Nevertheless, the company also has long term tailwinds such as the increasing cultural shifts to health and wellness which could increase demand for the company's apparel products. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) also has competitive advantages such as strong brands and scale. 71 hedge funds in our database owned shares of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) at the end of Q4, ranking the stock #11 on our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners.10. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a leading consumer staples company that hasn't done very well given the difficult cost and operating environment partially as a result of the higher inflation. Nevertheless, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) benefits from China opening up and the company said in January it expects to pay around $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of shares in fiscal 2023.

CTLT recently announced its successful formulation design and clinical-phase manufacturing collaboration with Grünenthal for an orally dosed small molecule in the latter’s pipeline. Through the tie-up, Catalent is expected to provide integrated development platforms to facilitate trials and accelerate early development to aid Grünenthal in progressing its research and development portfolio.The collaboration between the two players indicates their reaching a milestone in a joint Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls development project for the re-formulation of an investigational medicine to improve its bioavailability (the proportion of a drug which enters the circulation when introduced into the body and so is able to have an active effect).The latest partnership is likely to significantly solidify Catalent’s Pharma and Consumer Health business on a global scale.Rationale Behind the CollaborationCatalent and Grünenthal (a global science-driven pharmaceutical company with strength in pain research and management) have been working together on this program since 2021, where Catalent has been assisting Grünenthal in reformulating the molecule using a lipid-based drug delivery system formulated in softgel technology to improve its bioavailability. This was done using Catalent’s OptiForm Solution Suite platform, which allowed the rapid characterization and screening of dose forms and formulation technologies to optimize dose design.Per Catalent’s management, as innovators demand shortened drug development timeframes, the company’s offerings of a number of integrated solutions can ensure that programs can be accelerated to, and through, clinical phases as quickly and safely as possible. At the same time, it provides design and delivery technology support to give molecules the utmost chance of success.Grünenthal’s management believes that the OptiForm Solution Suite is expected to provide an efficient approach to accelerate innovative candidates into first-in-human studies. The Catalent Xpress Pharmaceutics platform (which was used in the phase 1 studies of the molecule) will likely provide the flexibility to efficiently manage its candidates via early clinical development studies.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global softgel capsules market was valued at $7.62 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 7.9% from 2022 to 2030. Factors like ease of swallowing, improved absorption and enhanced bioavailability are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest collaboration seems to have been timed well.Notable Developments in Pharma and Consumer HealthLast month, Catalent announced the completion of a $2.2 million expansion to its clinical supply facility in Singapore. This has increased the site’s footprint, thereby creating the space to install an additional 35 new freezers for ultra-low temperature storage.The same month, Catalent announced the launch of TASCENSO orally disintegrating tablet (ODT), its first product to treat Multiple Sclerosis patients in the United States.In January, Catalent executed a development and license agreement with Ethicann Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop Ethicann’s clinical drug pipeline using its Zydis ODT technology.Price PerformanceShares of Catalent have lost 34.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s 18.1% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 13.1% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Catalent carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.Aerospace manufacturers Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Bell will hold meetings with state-owned Vietnamese defence procurement companies, Thanh told Reuters, adding that it was the first time in about a decade that security firms had decided to join the annual mission to Vietnam.In December, the same companies held talks with Vietnamese government officials about the possible sale of helicopters and drones, as the country seeks new suppliers and the Ukraine conflict strains the capabilities of Russia, for decades Vietnam's main military partner.""Helicopters is one of the things the companies hope to sell to the Vietnamese,"" Thanh said, although he cautioned that defence deals took time to be completed and no immediate breakthrough was expected.Boeing said in a statement that its discussions with officials would focus on its growing partnership with Vietnam and ways to strengthen the country's aviation and defence capabilities.Story continuesLockheed Martin and Bell did not respond to requests for comment.The majority of the companies joining the business mission already have a business or manufacturing presence in Vietnam, including Apple, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Thanh said, with some planning to expand it.Some companies are also coming to get a better sense of the political situation after recent turmoil in the Communist-Party led country, including the resignation of the president in January, Thanh added.Participants will have meetings with Vietnam's top political and regulatory leadership, including with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.Thanh said some companies were interested in Vietnam as a manufacturing hub and in providing services to increasingly wealthy consumers at a time when economic growth reached more than 8% last year.Among them is SpaceX, which is looking to sell its satellite internet services to Vietnam and other countries in the region, Thanh said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.The mission will also include semiconductors companies, pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, medical device maker Abbott, financial firms Visa and Citibank, internet and cloud companies Meta and Amazon Web Services, the list showed.(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this internet video service have returned -16% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.9% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has lost 15.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.18 points to a change of +12.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.29 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Netflix is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NFLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Netflix, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.18 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.15 billion and $38.12 billion estimates indicate +8% and +11.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $7.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $0.12 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was -74.47%.Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:MUX) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 14, 2023Operator: Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to McEwen Mining's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2022 Operating and Financial Results Conference Call. Present from the company today are Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner; Perry Ing, Chief Financial Officer; William Shaver, Chief Operating Officer; Michael Meding, Vice President and General Manager of McEwen Copper. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rob McEwen, Chief Owner. Please go ahead, sir. Again, Mr. Rob McEwen, please go ahead.Rob McEwen: Thank you, operator. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I'll start with a discussion about gold and then our share price performance and follow up with factors driving our future. With all the uncertainties in the world, many people are asking why the price of gold hasn't climbed much higher. I believe that most investors feel that we have entered into a new era where very low interest rates and massive monetary stimulation are here to stay. And the gold's reputation as a store of wealth is no longer relevant or needed in a world of awash with easy money. However, as we all know, the unexpected happens quickly. Rising interest rates and an unexpected bank failure are vivid reminders, gold still has a role to play in your portfolio.I suspect more investors will start adding gold and gold shares to their portfolio and they will follow the lead of a select number of central banks who became large gold buyers in 2022. In fact, their purchases were the largest purchases made in the past 50 years by central bankers. Perhaps they too are concerned about holding too much of their reserves in fiat currencies. So, during 2022, the price of gold outperformed not only gold equities, but also the Dow Jones. Gold increased 1% year-over-year, and at the yesterday's close, it was up 6% since December 31, 2021. During that same period, the senior and junior gold equities as measured by the ETFs, the GDX and the GDXJ registered losses of 10.5% and 15%, respectively in 2022, while the Dow was down 3.7%.Story continuesBut if we look back another year to December 31, 2021, and come forward to yesterday's close, the GDX was down 9.1%, the GDXJ down 16.2%, and the Dow was down 12.4%. We weren't as lucky in 2022. Our share price was hammered. It was down a painful 36%. Fortunately, it has recovered much of this loss and has increased an impressive 136% since the end of last year, December 31, 2022. And if we look back to December 31, '21, our share price is only down 13.1%, which is less than the GDX decline of 16.2%, and very close to the decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 12.4%. So, looking at our stock chart, from a technical perspective, it looks very promising. With our share price having broken out on the upside through its 50, 100, 300 day moving averages.Driving this price improvement is our demonstration of improving operational performance, good exploration results, production growth, and lower cost per ounce, along with the growing recognition that McEwen Copper's Los Azules project is a large copper resource with large strategic shareholders, Rio Tinto, the world's second largest mining company, and Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automobile manufacturer and mobility provider. For 2023, we are looking at a production increase of 12.5% to 27.5% over what we did in 2022, and our costs are expected to decline by about 5%. In 2022, our Fox Complex and Gold Bar mines generated operating profits, but the accelerated activities at our subsidiary McEwen Copper and its Los Azules project and our heavy investment in exploration contributed significantly to our large reported loss.I will now ask Perry to provide details on how we performed financially in 2022 and more importantly what we see going forward in 2023. He will be followed by our Director and Interim Chief Operating Officer, Bill Shaver, who will comment on our success in stabilizing our mine operations and where we see growth in those operations. Bill will be followed by Michael Meding, our Vice President and General Manager of McEwen Copper, who will outline our progress at Los Azules and the financings we recently completed and the strategic shareholders we have. Perry, off to you.Perry Ing: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. As Rob mentioned, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results for 2022, and then I'll discuss the impact of the recent Stellantis and Nuton, Rio Tinto transactions for our balance sheet. These transactions are, obviously, transformative for the company. We'll deleverage our balance sheet in a rising interest rate environment and allow the company to advance its Fenix project in Mexico, as well as continue to explore aggressively in Ontario and Nevada without issuing additional equity, especially at these current gold prices. For the Los Azules project, these transactions will bring two things. First, it brings on a key partner in the project in Stellantis and strengthens the relationship with another in Rio Tinto.It also provides significant funding to Argentina to continue our aggressive exploration efforts and provide McEwen Copper further flexibility in the timing of a potential IPO. First off though, I'll start with a review of McEwen Mining's consolidated results for the prior year. It is important to note that we report McEwen Copper as a consolidated entity and reflect 100% of its expenditures on Los Azules on our income statement. As a U.S.-listed company reporting under U.S. accounting standards, we do not have the option of capitalizing the exploration and development costs at the project or any of our other projects for that matter until we have a completed feasibility study and permits for development, unlike many of our Canadian listed peers that often capitalize these costs at a much earlier stage.In terms of looking at our headline figures, we reported a loss for the quarter and year of $37.4 million and $81.1 million, respectively. This translates into $0.79 per share and $1.71 per share, respectively. As ** for the loss for the year is due to the expensing of costs at Los Azules net of foreign exchange gains realized. A further 25% roughly is due to exploration and development costs at our 100% owned properties. The remainder of the loss figures per share reflect our G&amp;A costs and certain one-time tax charges. I also note that the per share amounts reflect the 10 for 1 share consolidations completed in July of last year, which re-established the company's compliance with NYSE share price listing requirements. Looking at our 100% owned mines, we generated a cash gross profit of $7.9 million for the quarter and $19.2 million for the full year, respectively.On a gross profit basis, these operations were essentially breakeven, a significant improvement over 2021 performance. Looking at gold equivalent production, production for the fourth quarter of 37,300 gold equivalent ounces was down just under 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by a decrease of approximately 2,000 ounces at Gold Bar as they transition into the new Gold Bar South pit during the quarter. Full year production of 133,300 gold equivalent ounces was down approximately 14% year-over-year. Again, the decrease was primarily driven at Gold Bar due to carbonaceous ore issues experienced earlier in the year as well as the transition into Gold Bar South in the fourth quarter of the year. At the San Jose mine, production was down approximately 10% year-over-year due to issues with COVID and at the mill in the first quarter of 2022.Bill Shaver will cover off these line operations in further detail. So, the revenue and cost standpoint realized gold prices were roughly unchanged at the $1,800 level for both 2022 and the prior year. Gold prices were slightly lower in the fourth quarter of 2022, but appears to have rebounded well into the first quarter of this year so far. Looking at costs, we noted significant improvement in cash costs at our 100% owned operations at $1,276 per ounce, which have decreased steadily since 2020, but lower cost reported at both the Fox Complex and Gold Bar compared to the prior year. All-in sustaining costs were largely consistent with the prior year and reflect the cost of bringing Gold Bar South into production at -- in Nevada. At the San Jose mine, both cash costs and all-in sustaining costs increased incrementally over the prior year, reflecting lower production due to the issues I noted previously.Finally, looking at our treasury, at the end of the year, our cash and equivalent balance stood at $44 million compared to $60 million at the beginning of the year. Now, I'll turn the attention to the recent transactions with Stellantis and Nuton, Rio Tinto and how it impacts our balance sheet and working capital on a go-forward basis. These transactions all closed within the past three weeks. The transaction included an offering of primary shares directly from the McEwen Copper and a component of secondary shares, which are the shares of McEwen Copper owned by McEwen Mining. The details are summarized in our news release, so I'll just try to encapsulate it at a high level. Essentially, McEwen Mining, if we look at it as a standalone company, it receives $48 million.McEwen Copper receives approximately ARS30 billion. The price point of these transactions -- the price point at which these transactions are valued from McEwen Copper standpoint has nearly doubled the initial $10 per share amount when we did the investments in June and August of last year. Following these transactions, McEwen Mining's ownership of McEwen Copper reduces from approximately 68% at the end of 2022 to 51.9% today. In terms of the proceeds to McEwen Mining, we intend to use $25 million of the proceeds to retire the secured debt to Sprott Lending, which will reduce our total debt from $65 million to $40 million, saving the company significant interest costs going forward. With our enhanced treasury, we believe we now have the funds on hand to build Phase 1 of the Fenix project in Mexico and bring that operation into production within the next year without raising additional capital.As far as McEwen Copper's treasury, the ARS30 billion is a significant amount. At official exchange rate, this is equivalent to over $150 million. Using less official measures, such as a Blue Chip Swap rate, this is approximately equal to about $80 million. With this round of financing completed, McEwen Copper is well positioned to execute its drilling and development program for the remainder of the year and into 2024, which Michael will outline. So, based on these transactions, the urgency to complete an IPO in the first half of 2023 has been eliminated. So, with that, I'll turn the presentation over to Bill Shaver.William Shaver: Thank you very much, Perry. Good morning, shareholders. This morning, I'd like to leave you with three messages with regard to our operations. We have improved mining operations at the Fox Complex and are improving milling operations, which will result in higher output and lower cash costs in 2023. At Gold Bar, we have successfully transitioned to a new contractor and we have moved the operations to Gold Bar South pit, which will produce most of the ore in 2023. And based on the first two months of production, we are fully transitioned on both fronts, that being the new contractor and full operations. Cash costs for these operations will be approximately $1,100 per ounce in 2023, which is a significant improvement of approximately 15% from 2022.And lastly, at the Fenix project, as Perry has mentioned, we have moved the plant -- that we purchased last year to the plant site and are at -- in the working stages of planning production in early 2024. The last quarter of 2022 was challenging, but hard work by all our mining operations helped us overcome these hurdles, making Q4 a reasonable quarter. We are also making progress in stabilizing and improving operations, so we can obtain predictable outcomes for gold production and costs in 2023 and into the future. And so far, this year, we are on track. On the safety front, in 2022, we had two low severity lost-time incidents in January and March at our El Gallo operations. And for the rest of the year, we were lost-time accident free. At the Fox Complex, we have operated for a full year in 2022 with no lost-time injuries.mining, ore, goldPhoto by Artyom korshunov on UnsplashAnd at Gold Bar, we recently passed three years without a lost-time injury. On the environmental front, we -- there were no environmental events recorded in 2022. Now, I'll turn it over to each of the operations. At the Fox Complex, we had a very challenging year with our mill, which continued to have significant availability issues, which hampered our throughput. This resulted in us missing our gold production last year. At the same time, the mine had an excellent year, which resulted in a stockpile build up to 120,000 tonnes by year-end. This represents a value of approximately $15 million after milling and recovery. On a positive note, we have now undertaken crushing of the ore at the mine prior to it being shipped to the mill. This lowers the amount of work that the mill needs to do in processing the ore.This decision was followed -- was following a test program to prove this concept last year. We have been able to get our production tonnage through the mill successfully in Q1 of 2023 and are looking forward to improving the throughput when we get the contract crushing plant that we have planned for the remainder of the year at Froome into place. This plant will be commissioned in early April, which will allow us to reduce the size of stockpile we have at the Fox mill, transforming it into gold and therefore cash. We anticipate we will meet our budgeted cash call for the year of $922 per ounce. At the Gold Bar mine in Nevada, 2022 was also challenging with our issues of preg-robbing ore and our parting of ways with our mining contractor at the start of Q4.Notwithstanding these issues, we transitioned the mine plan successfully to main production in Q4, and we are happy to tell you we have successfully transitioned to a new contractor who is now in full production. We also completed the move to the Gold Bar South pit and are now in full production in this pit. Gold production from Gold Bar has been on budget for the first two months of this year and we're looking forward to a good year from operations. At the Fenix project in Mexico, we have been able to develop an approach to get the Fenix project in production in a timely manner and at a significantly lower capital cost. We will reprocess the heap leach pad, which has a grade of 0.6 grams per tonne. To accomplish this, we have acquired a used 7,000 tonne per day gold processing plant, which operated recently at a local mining operation.We have moved 80% of this plant to our site. And for Fenix, we will initially assemble only the grinding circuit, the cyclones and the leaching portion of the plant and use the present El Gallo gold recovery circuit. This will reduce the CapEx to approximately $12 million with the potential to increase the throughput as we move into production and prove that this plant will give the required outputs. There are a few minor changes in our permits that are required, but we hope to have this plant operating late this year or early in 2024. With that, I thank you very much. And now I'll turn it over to Michael for an update on our world-class Los Azules project.Michael Meding: Thank you so much, Bill. I will quickly highlight our financing and strategic importance of our new shareholders, then report on our drilling, exploration and study work, and finally mention what we did last year and in 2023 concerning our enhanced organizational and ESG competence in Argentina. McEwen Copper completed $81.9 million offering, including a $25 million investment by Nuton, a Rio Tinto Venture, on August 31, 2022, followed on October 24, by an option agreement with Kennecott Exploration, another subsidiary of Rio Tinto, for potential earn in of 60% for Elder Creek by investing $18 million over seven years. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we announced the closing of an ARS30 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler Argentina, a subsidiary of Stellantis, to acquire shares of McEwen Copper and of a second investment of $30 million by Nuton that increased the investment to $55 million.Now, Nuton is an innovative new venture with the portfolio of proprietary copper heap leach related technologies and capabilities at the core, a product of almost 30 years of research and development. Those have the potential to economically unlock copper sulfide resources and achieve higher copper recoveries on oxide and transitional material. Rio Tinto is the world's second biggest mining company, bringing significant financial and technical resources to McEwen Copper and the Los Azules project. Stellantis, on the other hand, is one of the world's leading automakers. It produces iconic brands such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroen, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, Vauxhall and others. And in Argentina, Stellantis produces about 160,000 cars yearly, has about 3,000 employees and is present with manufacturing in Buenos Aires and in Cordoba, Argentina.Partnering with Stellantis is an expression of a paradigm shift for downstream customers of copper. Companies realize that copper is a mineral critical to the green energy and mobility transition. And to my knowledge, it's the first time an automotive company has invested in a copper company. Subsequent to those transactions, Stellantis and Nuton each own 14.2% of McEwen Copper. McEwen Mining's ownership is now approximately 52%. Now I'm going to talk about drilling, exploration, site and study work. A total of $41.3 million was incurred in 2022 at the Los Azules project to advance drilling, engineering and project feasibility work. Drilling has focused on increasing drill hole density to upgrade the copper mineral resource classification to measured and indicated and to define the payback pit design better, to provide metallurgical, hydrological and geotechnical data to support mine design and (ph) exploration testing for potential extensions of the copper resource to the north, south and the depth of this already vast deposit, which Mining Intelligence ranked in 2022 as the ninth largest undeveloped copper project by copper resource size.In 2022, drilling started in January and went to May when it stopped for the winter in the southern hemisphere, then restarted in October and is currently ongoing. Since October 2022, there were six drill rigs on site and five more were added in early 2023. From 2022 to date, we have drilled over 105,000 feet, approximately 32,000 meters, in 98 drill holes to increase geological confidence and we see that drill results are generally consistent with our model. Beyond our robust delineation results, published in January and March this year, we recently published our northern step-out exploration results with 1,052 meters of 0.29% copper including an interval of 480 meters of 0.42% copper, which demonstrates the potential of the deposits to the north.The updated PEA will include all available information on drilling, assay and metallurgical testing obtained until early 2023 and is now slated for publishing during Q2 this year. We are developing a scenario for Los Azules as an open pit mine that initially processes leachable copper content in a heap leach, with a solvent extraction and electro winning facility to produce copper cathodes. This scenario is more environmentally sensitive due to its much lower water consumption and carbon footprint, and is de risking the project due to lower complexity. The project design makes use of renewable energy, which will allow for low carbon footprint production and improves financial attractiveness. While the PEA as a base case considers economic leaching without Nuton technology, we are excited to be able to test heap leaching using their technology, which could represent a very interesting upside scenario, and initial results are promising.We are in preparation for the filing of the environmental permit application for the exploitation stage to the San Juan mining authorities. The drafting of the report is underway and on track for submitting it to the authorities in April 2023. In 2022, a major advance was made that will accelerate the development of the Los Azules project with the completion of a new low altitude access roads, which goes to a maximum of about 11,000 feet or approximately 3,400 meters above sea level, which we share in part with other mining projects, including El Pachon from Glencore and Altar from Aldebaran Resources. The importance of having a second road into the site at more than 2,000 feet low altitude means that we now have almost year-round access to the site.In addition, we upgraded the exploration roads, the former existing roads, to allow for articulated 18 wheelers to get to site, a significant logistics improvement, lowering costs and quickening transports. With regards to our organization, a strong and experienced management team was set up in Argentina in 2022. With management team members having a total of over 180 years of experience in Tier One operations, the majority in San Juan, Argentina where the project is located. To further cement our relations with local communities, we opened up our community affairs office in Calingasta in San Juan where the project is located, to have even closer relations with the community we are operating in. And I can report that we are happy to receive ongoing support to develop our project there.This concludes my report on McEwen Copper. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn it back over to Rob.Rob McEwen: Thanks, Michael. I'd like to say I've always felt that Los Azules was a tremendous asset for McEwen Mining. The problem was in 2022, our share price was scraping along the bottom and our treasury was small. But in order to advance Los Azules, we needed a lot of money. And the thought of trying to do a financing when we -- our share price was at historic lows was just not that attractive or possibly feasible. So, we decided the best way to advance Los Azules and build its value and surface the value for McEwen Mining and allow it to access financing was to create McEwen Copper and fund it separately. And I believe we have been successful in surfacing value. We've attracted the second largest mining company in the world as a shareholder and the fourth largest automobile manufacturer in the world.So, both did extensive due diligence on this, on Los Azules, and just confirming that we do have a very large, very attractive copper projects that will likely be one of the larger copper mines in the world when it is built. So, last August, we raised $82 million at a share price of $10. And now seven months later, we've completed an even larger financing of $30 million and ARS30 billion at an average price of approximately $18.75. As a result, the implied value of Los Azules has increased from $260 million to $550 million. And that's excluding the 1.25% royalty that McEwen Mining holds on this property. So, now behind every share of McEwen Mining, on a fully diluted basis, is a value of $5.70 from Los Azules. Back in mid-2020, our share price was around $3 a share.Looking ahead, with our operations performing much better than they have in the past, with prospects of growth at our Fox Complex where we can see the potential to double production and further reduce cost to below $900 an ounce; mining at Gold Bar, we're in a new deposit that is higher grade and lower strip, and assuming the winter doesn't frustrate our plans, we'll be increasing production by better than 50%; and we're looking at the Fox Complex increasing production anywhere from 15% to 30% and keeping its costs around a $1,000 an ounce, we're looking at 150,000 to 170,000 gold equivalent ounces, representing an increase between 13% to 28%. McEwen Mining trades at a significant discount to its peer group and our objective is to get up and exceed that peer group economic value for gold equivalent ounce.And when we do that, along with continuing to progress our Los Azules project, I think that the value behind McEwen Mining is going to increase and I see a value of somewhere between $7 and $28 a share. And you might be wondering how I got that number. There are -- and it's really the sum of the parts. We have Los Azules in there. And compared to two other copper projects in the same province in Argentina, we're at a lower altitude closer to the infrastructure, then they are roads powered. Based on the published resources, we have a larger resource and a higher copper grade than either of those two properties, yet, one has a value -- was purchased at $485 million last April and the other one has a market cap of about $1.9 billion. So, you could see -- I think we are in a position to be somewhere between that $500 million and $2 billion for the value for Los Azules.We have five royalties -- non-producing royalties, 1.25% on Los Azules, 1.25% on McEwen Coppers, other copper project, Elder Creek, which you heard earlier has been optioned by Rio's exploration arm Kennecott Copper, and then we have our gold assets that are trading well below our peer group. So, I think there's quite a bit of room to grow. And I think we're in really good position to push forward on that front. The investment that we have brought in recently into McEwen Copper, although it reduced our interest -- our ownership interest, it increased the value significantly of that asset. And it allowed us to reduce McEwen Mining's debt and put money in the treasury of McEwen Mining to further the development of our Fox Complex, expand down in Mexico and fund our exploration program.So, if any of you are interested in buying -- getting exposure to McEwen Copper, right now, the best way to do it is through the shares of McEwen Mining or wait for the IPO of McEwen Copper.

ISA member states are currently meeting in Kingston for talks with a view to finalising the rules by July.Norway is also considering opening parts of its extended continental shelf in the North Atlantic for mineral exploration.Loke said Norway's Kongsberg Gruppen, which provides technologies for offshore oil and gas and other industries, has taken a stake in it, joining TechnipFMC and Wilhelmsen.

Both instruments were trading close to their highest levels since early-January, and were up nearly 3% for the week.The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (NASDAQ:SIVB) and other smaller regional peers saw markets pile into gold this week. While government intervention and the bailout of other stressed lenders helped stem fears of contagion, markets still remained on edge over a broader banking crisis.This also saw traders significantly tone down expectations of more interest rate hikes by the Fed, ahead of a meeting next week. Markets are pricing in a nearly 90% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points (bps), smaller than prior expectations for a 50 bps hike.This notion weighed on the dollar, which also benefited metal markets. But the greenback pared a bulk of its losses this week, helped by some safe haven demand and as some U.S. inflation data read stronger-than-expected for February.Relatively high inflation puts more pressure on the Fed to hike interest rates. Focus is now squarely on the bank’s meeting next week, which is also expected to provide more cues on monetary policy.Rising interest rates push up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, and had battered metal markets through 2022.Other precious metals firmed on Friday, and were set to end the week higher. Silver and platinum futures rose 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, and were up 7.1% and 2%, respectively, for the week.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper prices steadied on Friday after marking bruising losses this week on fears that a potential recession will severely crimp demand.Copper futures were flat at $3.8742 a pound, and were down nearly 4% this week.Related ArticlesGold prices set for strong week as bank jitters spur safe haven demandOil steadies as investors take stock of banking crisisU.S. farm, food groups urge Congress to pass authority for new trade deals]"

Secure your seat todayDenzel Washington. Ben Affleck. Serena Williams. Tina Fey. Rihanna. These are the types of names that are represented by WME (William Morris Endeavor), an elite talent agency that runs a good chunk of Hollywood.Founded in 1898, WME has a roster of talent across nearly every branch of culture – film, music, television, comedy, books, art, theater. And in 2021, the firm expanded its scope to include a new vertical: crypto.The impact of Web3, ultimately, is “going to be very similar to the way that the rise of the internet completely changed humanity,” says Chris Jacquemin, head of digital strategy of WME and the partner who led the firm’s embrace of Web3. Under Jacquemin’s watch, WME has signed more than 50 Web3 creators, building an eclectic roster that now includes Mack Flavelle (co-founder of Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot), AI (artificial-intelligence) artist Claire Silver and pseudonymous NFT artist FEWOCiOUS.This interview is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week. Chris Jacquemin is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April.“I've always evaluated data and media trends,” says Jacquemin, who began his career in research and has a knack for spotting trends in tech on the early side – from DVRs to YouTube to the rise of social media. Years ago, Jacquemin started the firm’s digital media business, which led to signing podcasters, esports gamers, Web2 creators and others.And Jacquemin saw the potential with Web3. He discovered bitcoin (BTC) over a decade ago (alas, he says he wasn't “tech savvy” enough to buy any at the time) and had been curious about the sector for years. In 2020, he asked his colleagues things like, “Have you ever heard of an NFT?” Most hadn’t. But he also knew that younger employees at WME, like assistants, were buying crypto and trading non-fungible tokens. He felt a generational shift.Over two years later, WME continues to sign talent – even during crypto winter – who often works with existing clients on Web3 collaborations. (This is the benefit of scale. New Web3 clients can help WME’s “legacy” clients get into Web3, and the traditional arm of WME can offer new playgrounds for the Web3 clients. Win/win.)Story continuesWME is even signing Web3 developers, as Jacquemin thinks of them almost as “producers” who can help creators fulfill their vision. “There’s real value in understanding the developer ecosystem,” says Jacquemin, who is pushing the boundaries of what it means to sign creative talent. He opens up about why WME has embraced Web3, how he explains it to his colleagues, why he’s not too concerned about crypto winter and why he’s spending “an inordinate amount of my career in this area.”Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.When did you first explore the idea of WME getting into Web3?Jacquemin: It was actually in the fall of 2020. My background is in research, so I really obsess over a lot of consumer trends and behavioral trends. And what I was seeing in 2020 was that everybody's at home during the pandemic and the collecting market exploded. Sneakers, coins, trading cards, stamps, you name it. And everybody was feeling isolated. There was a thirsting for community and connectivity.And, in parallel, crypto was on fire. So it felt like this perfect storm. I stumbled on a data report that suggested that by the end of 2020, there would be roughly $300 million in NFT sales.It reminded me of how when YouTube launched, I had made this proclamation like, ""This is going to become the most disruptive thing to happen in video we've ever seen."" This felt similar. We were seeing the emergence of a new file format and collectible construct of assets. And it tied into a generational shift that I thought was happening. It felt like, “Okay, this is all coming together. This is real. Let's go.""How’d you pitch the idea internally, to your colleagues?I was explaining that, “Much like you’ve heard me say many times before, technology allows creators to tell stories, using these new platforms and devices and tools. So this is just another canvas for our clients to paint on and to play in.”We really came at it from this point of view as an opportunity to tell stories in a different medium and reach a different community.Smart. But I’m guessing this wasn’t always an easy sell. What kind of pushback did you get?One thing people said was, “Is this kind of a fad? Is this going to be something that goes away?” We had a little bit of that.There was certainly a little bit of, “I don't even understand what we'd be making here. What does this look like as a creative project?” That was a big one. And there were a lot of other issues at the time that are no longer as prevalent, such as the environmental pushback.How’d you overcome the objections?I think one of the things that I have a good reputation for is removing a lot of the technical speak. So for NFTs, it’s, “Let’s just talk about these as digital collectibles.” And I’d tell them, “This is a theme that you’ve seen before, no different than the rare Fortnite skins that you might have bought or the World of Warcraft secondary market that was happening illegally on eBay. We’ve seen this before. And because these are familiar themes, the technology that underpins these new developments is not going away.”Read more: How Web3 Animation Project 'The Gimmicks' Survives a Crypto WinterAnd I would tell them that it’s going to be very similar to the way that the rise of the internet completely changed humanity and our access to information on a global scale. The rise of social media allowed for the world's population to connect over common areas of interests. This is another wave of that. So let's think about how it [Web3] complements a lot of the work that we’re already doing in these areas: artist fan clubs, merch as collectibles.How’d you guys jump in?Well, a few years before we were early-stage investors in Dapper Labs. But in 2020 there was nothing on our roster that represented Web3, if you will. And the pattern I kept seeing was that the success of so many projects tied back to particular artists, such as Beeple or FEWOCiOUS or XCOPY.And it became very clear that this is no different, in a way, than how you wouldn’t make a television show without a showrunner or you wouldn't make a movie without a filmmaker. I saw the importance of the visual artist to be central to the success of these projects. So if you are an athlete or a music artist or a storyteller looking to get into Web3, then you should really think about partnering with these [Web3] visual artists who have a track record of building communities, in building creative projects and certainly building value in this space. And to look at them as partners, not look at them as somebody that you can pay a small fee.It’s very analogous to how you would put together a television show or a film. So over the course of the first few months in 2021, we began to identify people like Mack Flavelle and FEWOCiOUS. We said, ""Okay, we should go sign them and build up a roster to represent them. And this will then help us as we're putting more projects together in this new area.""Interesting. So signing Web3 clients also helps your current clients get into Web3. Smart. What are some of your favorite success stories?I think a more recent one is bringing Scottie Pippen into the Web3 space. This was met with a really positive reception, and it has done quite well. Orange Comet, who we partnered Scottie with, had a really thoughtful and creative take on the project. Scottie got really excited about the space overall.And also getting Jim Carrey into it. In addition to being a highly successful movie star, he's a painter and is genuinely passionate about his artwork. So we worked with him and partnered with SuperRare (a crypto art and NFT marketplace). I think it was a good example of bringing an artist into the space in the right way. He started by collecting first, as opposed to just putting out his own art. We feel really proud about that one.Victor Langlois aka FEWOCiOUS (Will Ess for Pixelmind.ai/CoinDesk)You’ve signed such a wide range of Web3 clients, from artists to developers to founders. I can see how a visual artist makes sense – that feels like the kind creative talent that an agency typically signs. But I wouldn’t have guessed you’d be signing … developers?!Yeah, so it's interesting. I think of people that fall into that category, or companies that fall into that category, as essentially producers.When I look at new technologies, I describe them to our [traditional] clients as opportunities to tell stories. In this area, there is a bit of a technical barrier. So if you look at something like generative art, for example, there's a coding aspect to it. Yes, you need to make a visual design and something aesthetically pleasing. But there’s also a coding component to creating the generative output. Or, in the example I shared about Transient Labs, bringing a technical dynamic aspect to an art project is often not something that the visual artist inherently knows how to do. Or an athlete or music artist, for that matter.So it’s just working backwards off a potential creative concept, and realizing that there are actually some partners – or producers, if you will – that happen to have a much more technical background. It was an early observation that we made. Because when I zoom out and I talk about Web3, I'm including gaming and the metaverse and AI and a lot of these technologies. So it’s understanding how to build in these different environments and across these different platforms. There’s real value in understanding the developer ecosystem that exists around it, and identifying ways to either represent those companies, like Transient, or where we've got some referral-oriented relationships and can create some sort of a strategic partnership.What advice would you give Web3 creators who are hoping to get signed by an agent? What are you looking for?What we look for is unique storytelling. And unique is the operative word here, because there are a lot of projects that seem to copy other projects.So we’re looking for both creative uniqueness and also strategic uniqueness. What our client Gmoney has been doing with his 9dcc apparel collection – this is highly unique, super innovative and really thoughtful around the community. And if I wasn't representing him and I saw what he was doing, he would absolutely be an obvious target for us to go after.How has your work with Web3 been impacted by crypto winter? And how have you handled it?There are a couple things that I tend to say. One is, we've obviously seen a global [challenge] in broader financial markets, with equities and with inflation and rising interest rates. And economic downturns are just cyclical. We'll have the downturn, then there'll be a recovery period. I can't predict how long that will be, but I take comfort in the fact that this is just part of a series of different macroeconomic cycles. And I think that's largely what's affecting this space.And the second thing you say?I think it's safe to say that there's no systemic issue that underpins blockchain technology to its detriment.What do you mean exactly?What happened at FTX is different than what happened with Luna. And to some extent, it's different than what happened at 3AC. Yet all these things add to the clickbaity headline of “crypto's in the toilet, and there's no business to be done here.”And in some ways, what [crypto winter] has done to the benefit of this community is to really shine a light on who's here to stay. Which companies are well-funded, well -run, have strong entrepreneurship inside of them and are still interested in doing partnership deals with our clients? It's really important to play this for the long haul. This is not a one-and-done transaction that we're talking about.This is about making a commitment into this category. I think the statement is overused, but this is the time to build. And if you look at the number of tech unicorns, the majority of them were built in a bear market. I take a lot of comfort in that. It's why I've personally invested into the space and collect in the space, and am really spending an inordinate amount of my career in this area. I'm not naive to the crypto winter, but I'm also not concerned to where I've exited stage left.That’s two of us! Thanks Chris, and best of luck going forward.]"

112,bbd59298-5ec5-3bb6-9342-e50630dfd3f7,ZTS,2023-03-17,Zoetis (ZTS) Down 6.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-zts-down-6-5-153003787.html,1678980603,STORY,"['ZTS', 'CTLT']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Zoetis (ZTS). Shares have lost about 6.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Zoetis due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Zoetis’ Q4 Earnings in Line With Estimates, Revenues BeatZoetis Inc. posted fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings (excluding one-time items) of $1.15, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.00.Total revenues grew 4% year over year to $2.04 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 billion.Quarterly HighlightsZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.Revenues from the U.S. segment increased 7% year over year to $1.11 billion for the fourth quarter. Sales of companion animal products in this region grew 12% from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of Simparica Trio, the triple-combination parasiticide for dogs. The Apoquel and Cytopoint brands in the dermatology portfolio also contributed to this increase. However, sales of livestock products decreased 6% year over year for the quarter due to a decrease in cattle product sales as a result of supply re-stocking in the third quarter of 2022 and generic competition for Draxxin.Sales of swine products declined year over year. Also, sales of poultry products declined for the quarter due to the expanded use of lower-cost alternatives of premium products in addition to generic competition.Story continuesRevenues in the International segment were flat on a reported basis but increased 12% year over year on an operational basis to $901 million. Sales of companion animal products grew 7% on a reported and 21% on an operational basis. On a year-over-year basis, livestock product sales declined 7% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally. While sales of poultry products increased because of market expansion in several key geographies, sales of swine products declined due to supply constraints.The growth resulted from increased sales of Zoetis’ parasiticides portfolio, including the Simparica and Revolution franchises, the key dermatology portfolio consisting of both Apoquel and Cytopoint brands as well as the recently launched chewable version of Apoquel. The company’s monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs and Solensiafor cats, also contributed to growth in the reported quarter. Growth of the company’s fish portfolio was driven primarily by increased sales of vaccines across key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile.Full-Year 2022 ResultsZoetis posted 2022 adjusted earnings of $4.88 per share (excluding one-time items), which increased from the year-ago figure of $4.70 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.87.Total revenues grew 4% year over year to $8.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.05 billion.2023 GuidanceZoetis issued its guidance for 2023.The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $5.34-$5.44 per share.Revenues are projected between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Zoetis has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Zoetis has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerZoetis is part of the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry. Over the past month, Catalent (CTLT), a stock from the same industry, has gained 1.1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.Catalent reported revenues of $1.15 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.6%. EPS of $0.67 for the same period compares with $0.90 a year ago.Catalent is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -30.8%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Bank of New York Mellon BK, Northeast Community Bancorp NECB and SB Financial Group SBFG.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Ignore SVB Fiasco, These 3 Banks Are on Strong FootingThe stability of the U.S. banking system has been questioned after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week. The fate of the sixteenth largest bank was doomed following run-on deposits that squashed the lender's quest to raise fresh capital.Now, to prevent contagion in other regional banks, regulators stepped in. So, is it the right time to invest in bank stocks that are now exposed to bouts of volatility? Let us see in detail -What Led to Silicon Valley Bank's Failure?Ever since its inception, the Silicon Valley Bank became the lender for tech start-ups, whose businesses were perceived to be riskier by major banks. Over the years, the bank did business with eminent tech companies like Pinterest, Shopify, and Fitbit, to name a few. And particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the tech sector's boom saw a mammoth increase in deposits at the bank.The Silicon Valley Bank invested the cash received from such deposits into long-term government securities, perceived to be a safe investment. Regrettably, the value of such securities in recent times took a beating after the Federal Reserve began to hike interest rates aggressively to tame stubbornly high inflation. At the same time, tech companies were finding it difficult to raise money, which compelled them to withdraw money from their deposits in the Silicon Valley Bank accounts.However, like all banks, the Silicon Valley Bank needs to keep a minimum cash balance. So, to maintain such reserves, the bank had to sell some of its bonds. But the value of such bonds in the market was worth a lot less since the new bonds had higher interest rates. Thus, while selling its bonds, the bank had to bear huge losses, thereby spreading panic among its customers, that were mostly companies and not individuals.Story continuesNot only did the customers rush to get money out of the bank, but also venture capitalists started withdrawing their funds. The SVB Financial Group (SIVB), whose primary subsidiary is the Silicon Valley Bank, has witnessed its shares plummet 53.9% this year against the Zacks Banks – West industry's decline of 42.3%.Government Steps In to Prevent Broader Financial ContagionUnlike Lehman Brothers, the Silicon Valley Bank is not linked up with the rest of the financial system via a network of credit derivatives. However, the possibility of more depositors pulling money out of their banks because it may be facing the same kind of stress as the Silicon Valley Bank gave the Biden administration nightmares.After all, the Silicon Valley Bank issues did spill over to Signature Bank (SBNY), whose own depositors asked for big withdrawals. Shares of Signature Bank have plunged 39.2% year to date.The government stated that all Silicon Valley Bank customers, insured or not insured, will have access to their deposits. The FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund will be used to cover all depositors' accounts and not the standard $250,000 insured individual accounts. This assured all depositors at the Silicon Valley Bank and shored up confidence in the U.S. banking system.Furthermore, regulators took control of Signature Bank, and the Fed as well as the Treasury said that they would let emergency-lending authorities provide more funds to meet the demand for bank withdrawals and, in that way, protect against a collapse like that of Silicon Valley Bank.The Fed also assured that it would provide more funds to banks in times of emergencies through the new ""Bank Term Funding Program."" Per the program, banks that pledge mortgage-backed securities will be provided loans for up to one year.Is It Prudent to Invest in Bank Shares Now?Given that regulators have stepped up their efforts to protect customers' deposits, while banks remain well-positioned to get access to emergency funding, there are no contagion risks. President Biden, in the meantime, has pledged to make the regulatory system stronger to quell future crises in the banking system.This calls for investing in banks that are fundamentally strong and well-capitalized. Overall, investors' sentiment for the time being could remain weak on the broader banking system due to the unprecedented event. However, in the long run, banks do stand to gain. A sharp pullback in shares of banks also provides an opportunity to buy undervalued companies.3 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected three bank stocks The Bank of New York Mellon, Northeast Community Bancorp and SB Financial Group. These stocks have a price-to-book value (P/BV) ratio of less than 1, indicating that the stock is underpriced.They have a debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio of less than 1, indicating that the company is solvent, or in other words, has adequate cash inflows to cover debt obligations.

117,bce00914-ab04-3c3d-bc51-88607c28e06d,BK,2023-03-17,"3 Major Regional Banks Worth a Look Despite SVB, SBNY Collapse",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-major-regional-banks-worth-122812179.html,1678969692,STORY,"['BAC', '^GSPC', 'BK', 'JPM']","[The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is expected to witness muted NII and NIM performance on the contagion risk arising from the bank runs at two closed banks. Higher interest rates due to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive hikes, which benefit the banks, are turning out to be counter-productive. Worsening asset quality, recessionary risk and a gradual slowdown in loan demand are other key headwinds.Yet, restructuring/expansion efforts and digitization will offer support. So, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Bank of America Corp. BAC and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK are worth taking a look.About the IndustryThe Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation’s largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation’s economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies. Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.Key Trends to Watch in the Major Regional Banks IndustryHawkish Fed &amp; Bank Run Risk: The Fed’s ultra-aggressive monetary policy over the past year led the rates to reach a 15-year high level. The rising interest rates are a boon for major regional banks and they reaped substantial benefits in form of higher NIM and NII in 2022. But faster rate hikes after a prolonged period of low rates have their fall out, as seen in the past week with the collapse of two S&amp;P 500 banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This shook the confidence of the investors and depositors amid fears of contagion.The central bank has announced a new expansive emergency lending program – the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) – in an effort to limit the contagion risk. Yet, there are chances that other banks with unrealized losses or uninsured depositors could be at risk. In another blow to the U.S. banking sector, Moody’s downgraded its outlook on the entire sector to negative, reflecting the worsening operating backdrop following bank runs at the two collapsed banks. While the Fed is likely to keep increasing rates in the near term to control inflation, major regional banks are less likely to witness much improvement in NII going forward as funding costs rise. This will also put pressure on NIM in the upcoming period.Near-Term Recession Risk: The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy has intensified fears of a “mild” recession in the second half of 2023. Even the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections announced in December 2022 indicates the U.S. economy will slow down considerably this year, with just 0.5% growth. While major regional banks are better equipped to face economic downturn owing to the reforms introduced subsequent to the 2008 financial crisis, the lending scenario is likely to weaken as demand for loans gradually wanes.Asset Quality Metrics Touching Pre-Pandemic Level: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the coronavirus mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from the government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement. Yet, given the present macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, and rise in loan demand, major regional banks are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers will help keep banks’ asset quality manageable, several credit quality metrics are slowly creeping up toward pre-pandemic levels.Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking several strategic steps to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. Restructuring of operations is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability. Banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services as the demand for these witnessed a substantial rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Major regional banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into the U.K. and China. Banks are re-evaluating their business structure to improve operating efficiency. The main goal is to simplify operations and do away with non-core, unprofitable ones.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #151, which places it in the bottom 39% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of discouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since April 2022-end, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 8.5% lower.Before we present a few major bank stocks that you may keep an eye on despite deteriorating operating environment on bank run risk and rising interest rates, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past two years. While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 19.4% over the period, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has declined 2.8% and the Zacks Finance sector has fallen 8.5%.Two-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 1.70X. This compares with the highest level of 2.53X, lowest of 1.21X, and median of 2.10X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a huge discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 9.70X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a solid discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV came in at 4.53X. This is above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry’s ratio, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)3 Major Regional Banks to WatchJPMorgan: The largest U.S. bank (in terms of assets), JPMorgan has operations in more than 60 countries. The company is expected to benefit from the higher interest rate environment. Given the ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance and decent loan demand, the company is projecting NII (managed basis) to be approximately $73 billion for 2023.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) bank is also taking measures to further diversify operations. In September 2022, the company announced a deal to acquire Renovite. In December 2022, it acquired a 49% stake in Greece-based Viva Wallet, while in August, the company completed the deal to buy Global Shares. These, along with several others, are expected to keep supporting the bank's plan to diversify revenues and expand the fee income product suite and consumer bank digitally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Also, JPM is expanding its footprint in new regions and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. Apart from enhancing market share, the strategy will help the bank grab cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors. Apart from this, the company launched its digital retail bank Chase in the U.K. in 2021 and continues to expand investment banking and asset management operations in China.JPMorgan remains focused on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise and strengthening its loan portfolio. Despite a tough operating backdrop, deposits and loan balances have remained solid over the past several years. As of Dec 31, 2022, the loans to deposits ratio was 49%.JPMorgan has a solid capital deployment plan. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the bank kept the quarterly dividend unchanged at $1 per share. Also, to maintain higher future capital requirements amid macroeconomic challenges, the company has temporarily suspended share repurchases. Nonetheless, the bank has resumed share buyback effective first-quarter 2023 as it reached the CET1 ratio target of 13% earlier than expected. The company intends to repurchase shares worth $12 billion this year. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain current capital deployments.With a market cap of $396.2 billion, JPMorgan is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Also, analysts are bullish on the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally upward for 2023 over the past 30 days. The stock has rallied 8.6% over the past six months.Price and Consensus: JPM Bank of America: With total assets worth $3.05 trillion as of Dec 31, 2022, Bank of America is one of the largest financial holding companies in the United States. The company provides a diverse range of banking and non-banking financial services and products across North America and globally.BAC is well-poised to benefit from higher interest rates. The company’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. Provided loans grow modestly and rates in the forward curve materialize, management projects NII in the first quarter of 2023 to be around $14.4 billion.Bank of America continues to align its banking center network according to customer needs. These initiatives, along with the success of Zelle and Erica, have enabled it to improve digital offerings and cross-sell several products, including mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The acquisition of Axia Technologies has further strengthened its healthcare payments business.Prudent cost management continues to support this Zacks Rank #3 bank’s financials. Its expense-saving plan – Project New BAC (launched in 2011) – helped improve overall efficiency. Over the last several quarters, the company has incurred an average of $15 billion in expenses, despite undertaking strategic growth initiatives. The company expects expenses of $16 billion in the first quarter of 2023, inclusive of seasonally elevated payroll taxes.Post the clearance of the 2022 stress test, Bank of America announced a dividend hike of 4.8% in July 2022, following a 17% hike in July 2021. In October 2021, the company's share repurchase plan of $25 billion was renewed. In 2022, it returned $12 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividend payouts.With a market cap of $230.2 billion, Bank of America’s efforts to improve revenues, strong balance sheet and expansion into new markets will support financials. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for 2023. Over the past six months, shares of BAC have lost 17.9%.Price and Consensus: BAC BNY Mellon: Operating in 35 countries, BNY Mellon provides various products and services to individuals and institutions. Its global client base consists of financial institutions, corporations, government agencies, endowments and foundations, and high-net-worth individuals.Higher interest rates will support BNY Mellon’s top-line growth. While the company’s net interest revenues (NIR) and NIM declined in 2020 and 2021, both rebounded solidly in 2022. With more interest rate hikes expected this year, NIR and NIM are expected to continue improving. Management anticipates NIR to grow roughly 20% this year.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been trying to gain a foothold in foreign markets and is undertaking several growth initiatives (including launching new services, digitizing operations and making strategic buyouts). In 2022, non-U.S. revenues constituted 36% of total revenues. Its international revenues are expected to continue improving as the demand for personalized services rises globally.Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 9% to 37 cents per share in July. While BNY Mellon stopped share repurchases to meet the higher capital requirements, it announced a new share buyback program worth $5 billion, effective Jan 1, 2023. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain efficient capital deployments.BNY Mellon has a market cap of $36.6 billion. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 1.3% upward for 2023. In the past six months, the stock has dipped 0.5%.Price and Consensus: BKWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(NYSE:MUX) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcewen-mining-inc-nyse-mux-081559029.html,1679040959,STORY,"['MUX', 'HG=F', 'GC=F']","[McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE:MUX) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 14, 2023Operator: Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to McEwen Mining's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2022 Operating and Financial Results Conference Call. Present from the company today are Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner; Perry Ing, Chief Financial Officer; William Shaver, Chief Operating Officer; Michael Meding, Vice President and General Manager of McEwen Copper. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rob McEwen, Chief Owner. Please go ahead, sir. Again, Mr. Rob McEwen, please go ahead.Rob McEwen: Thank you, operator. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I'll start with a discussion about gold and then our share price performance and follow up with factors driving our future. With all the uncertainties in the world, many people are asking why the price of gold hasn't climbed much higher. I believe that most investors feel that we have entered into a new era where very low interest rates and massive monetary stimulation are here to stay. And the gold's reputation as a store of wealth is no longer relevant or needed in a world of awash with easy money. However, as we all know, the unexpected happens quickly. Rising interest rates and an unexpected bank failure are vivid reminders, gold still has a role to play in your portfolio.I suspect more investors will start adding gold and gold shares to their portfolio and they will follow the lead of a select number of central banks who became large gold buyers in 2022. In fact, their purchases were the largest purchases made in the past 50 years by central bankers. Perhaps they too are concerned about holding too much of their reserves in fiat currencies. So, during 2022, the price of gold outperformed not only gold equities, but also the Dow Jones. Gold increased 1% year-over-year, and at the yesterday's close, it was up 6% since December 31, 2021. During that same period, the senior and junior gold equities as measured by the ETFs, the GDX and the GDXJ registered losses of 10.5% and 15%, respectively in 2022, while the Dow was down 3.7%.Story continuesBut if we look back another year to December 31, 2021, and come forward to yesterday's close, the GDX was down 9.1%, the GDXJ down 16.2%, and the Dow was down 12.4%. We weren't as lucky in 2022. Our share price was hammered. It was down a painful 36%. Fortunately, it has recovered much of this loss and has increased an impressive 136% since the end of last year, December 31, 2022. And if we look back to December 31, '21, our share price is only down 13.1%, which is less than the GDX decline of 16.2%, and very close to the decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 12.4%. So, looking at our stock chart, from a technical perspective, it looks very promising. With our share price having broken out on the upside through its 50, 100, 300 day moving averages.Driving this price improvement is our demonstration of improving operational performance, good exploration results, production growth, and lower cost per ounce, along with the growing recognition that McEwen Copper's Los Azules project is a large copper resource with large strategic shareholders, Rio Tinto, the world's second largest mining company, and Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automobile manufacturer and mobility provider. For 2023, we are looking at a production increase of 12.5% to 27.5% over what we did in 2022, and our costs are expected to decline by about 5%. In 2022, our Fox Complex and Gold Bar mines generated operating profits, but the accelerated activities at our subsidiary McEwen Copper and its Los Azules project and our heavy investment in exploration contributed significantly to our large reported loss.I will now ask Perry to provide details on how we performed financially in 2022 and more importantly what we see going forward in 2023. He will be followed by our Director and Interim Chief Operating Officer, Bill Shaver, who will comment on our success in stabilizing our mine operations and where we see growth in those operations. Bill will be followed by Michael Meding, our Vice President and General Manager of McEwen Copper, who will outline our progress at Los Azules and the financings we recently completed and the strategic shareholders we have. Perry, off to you.Perry Ing: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. As Rob mentioned, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results for 2022, and then I'll discuss the impact of the recent Stellantis and Nuton, Rio Tinto transactions for our balance sheet. These transactions are, obviously, transformative for the company. We'll deleverage our balance sheet in a rising interest rate environment and allow the company to advance its Fenix project in Mexico, as well as continue to explore aggressively in Ontario and Nevada without issuing additional equity, especially at these current gold prices. For the Los Azules project, these transactions will bring two things. First, it brings on a key partner in the project in Stellantis and strengthens the relationship with another in Rio Tinto.It also provides significant funding to Argentina to continue our aggressive exploration efforts and provide McEwen Copper further flexibility in the timing of a potential IPO. First off though, I'll start with a review of McEwen Mining's consolidated results for the prior year. It is important to note that we report McEwen Copper as a consolidated entity and reflect 100% of its expenditures on Los Azules on our income statement. As a U.S.-listed company reporting under U.S. accounting standards, we do not have the option of capitalizing the exploration and development costs at the project or any of our other projects for that matter until we have a completed feasibility study and permits for development, unlike many of our Canadian listed peers that often capitalize these costs at a much earlier stage.In terms of looking at our headline figures, we reported a loss for the quarter and year of $37.4 million and $81.1 million, respectively. This translates into $0.79 per share and $1.71 per share, respectively. As ** for the loss for the year is due to the expensing of costs at Los Azules net of foreign exchange gains realized. A further 25% roughly is due to exploration and development costs at our 100% owned properties. The remainder of the loss figures per share reflect our G&amp;A costs and certain one-time tax charges. I also note that the per share amounts reflect the 10 for 1 share consolidations completed in July of last year, which re-established the company's compliance with NYSE share price listing requirements. Looking at our 100% owned mines, we generated a cash gross profit of $7.9 million for the quarter and $19.2 million for the full year, respectively.On a gross profit basis, these operations were essentially breakeven, a significant improvement over 2021 performance. Looking at gold equivalent production, production for the fourth quarter of 37,300 gold equivalent ounces was down just under 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by a decrease of approximately 2,000 ounces at Gold Bar as they transition into the new Gold Bar South pit during the quarter. Full year production of 133,300 gold equivalent ounces was down approximately 14% year-over-year. Again, the decrease was primarily driven at Gold Bar due to carbonaceous ore issues experienced earlier in the year as well as the transition into Gold Bar South in the fourth quarter of the year. At the San Jose mine, production was down approximately 10% year-over-year due to issues with COVID and at the mill in the first quarter of 2022.Bill Shaver will cover off these line operations in further detail. So, the revenue and cost standpoint realized gold prices were roughly unchanged at the $1,800 level for both 2022 and the prior year. Gold prices were slightly lower in the fourth quarter of 2022, but appears to have rebounded well into the first quarter of this year so far. Looking at costs, we noted significant improvement in cash costs at our 100% owned operations at $1,276 per ounce, which have decreased steadily since 2020, but lower cost reported at both the Fox Complex and Gold Bar compared to the prior year. All-in sustaining costs were largely consistent with the prior year and reflect the cost of bringing Gold Bar South into production at -- in Nevada. At the San Jose mine, both cash costs and all-in sustaining costs increased incrementally over the prior year, reflecting lower production due to the issues I noted previously.Finally, looking at our treasury, at the end of the year, our cash and equivalent balance stood at $44 million compared to $60 million at the beginning of the year. Now, I'll turn the attention to the recent transactions with Stellantis and Nuton, Rio Tinto and how it impacts our balance sheet and working capital on a go-forward basis. These transactions all closed within the past three weeks. The transaction included an offering of primary shares directly from the McEwen Copper and a component of secondary shares, which are the shares of McEwen Copper owned by McEwen Mining. The details are summarized in our news release, so I'll just try to encapsulate it at a high level. Essentially, McEwen Mining, if we look at it as a standalone company, it receives $48 million.McEwen Copper receives approximately ARS30 billion. The price point of these transactions -- the price point at which these transactions are valued from McEwen Copper standpoint has nearly doubled the initial $10 per share amount when we did the investments in June and August of last year. Following these transactions, McEwen Mining's ownership of McEwen Copper reduces from approximately 68% at the end of 2022 to 51.9% today. In terms of the proceeds to McEwen Mining, we intend to use $25 million of the proceeds to retire the secured debt to Sprott Lending, which will reduce our total debt from $65 million to $40 million, saving the company significant interest costs going forward. With our enhanced treasury, we believe we now have the funds on hand to build Phase 1 of the Fenix project in Mexico and bring that operation into production within the next year without raising additional capital.As far as McEwen Copper's treasury, the ARS30 billion is a significant amount. At official exchange rate, this is equivalent to over $150 million. Using less official measures, such as a Blue Chip Swap rate, this is approximately equal to about $80 million. With this round of financing completed, McEwen Copper is well positioned to execute its drilling and development program for the remainder of the year and into 2024, which Michael will outline. So, based on these transactions, the urgency to complete an IPO in the first half of 2023 has been eliminated. So, with that, I'll turn the presentation over to Bill Shaver.William Shaver: Thank you very much, Perry. Good morning, shareholders. This morning, I'd like to leave you with three messages with regard to our operations. We have improved mining operations at the Fox Complex and are improving milling operations, which will result in higher output and lower cash costs in 2023. At Gold Bar, we have successfully transitioned to a new contractor and we have moved the operations to Gold Bar South pit, which will produce most of the ore in 2023. And based on the first two months of production, we are fully transitioned on both fronts, that being the new contractor and full operations. Cash costs for these operations will be approximately $1,100 per ounce in 2023, which is a significant improvement of approximately 15% from 2022.And lastly, at the Fenix project, as Perry has mentioned, we have moved the plant -- that we purchased last year to the plant site and are at -- in the working stages of planning production in early 2024. The last quarter of 2022 was challenging, but hard work by all our mining operations helped us overcome these hurdles, making Q4 a reasonable quarter. We are also making progress in stabilizing and improving operations, so we can obtain predictable outcomes for gold production and costs in 2023 and into the future. And so far, this year, we are on track. On the safety front, in 2022, we had two low severity lost-time incidents in January and March at our El Gallo operations. And for the rest of the year, we were lost-time accident free. At the Fox Complex, we have operated for a full year in 2022 with no lost-time injuries.mining, ore, goldPhoto by Artyom korshunov on UnsplashAnd at Gold Bar, we recently passed three years without a lost-time injury. On the environmental front, we -- there were no environmental events recorded in 2022. Now, I'll turn it over to each of the operations. At the Fox Complex, we had a very challenging year with our mill, which continued to have significant availability issues, which hampered our throughput. This resulted in us missing our gold production last year. At the same time, the mine had an excellent year, which resulted in a stockpile build up to 120,000 tonnes by year-end. This represents a value of approximately $15 million after milling and recovery. On a positive note, we have now undertaken crushing of the ore at the mine prior to it being shipped to the mill. This lowers the amount of work that the mill needs to do in processing the ore.This decision was followed -- was following a test program to prove this concept last year. We have been able to get our production tonnage through the mill successfully in Q1 of 2023 and are looking forward to improving the throughput when we get the contract crushing plant that we have planned for the remainder of the year at Froome into place. This plant will be commissioned in early April, which will allow us to reduce the size of stockpile we have at the Fox mill, transforming it into gold and therefore cash. We anticipate we will meet our budgeted cash call for the year of $922 per ounce. At the Gold Bar mine in Nevada, 2022 was also challenging with our issues of preg-robbing ore and our parting of ways with our mining contractor at the start of Q4.Notwithstanding these issues, we transitioned the mine plan successfully to main production in Q4, and we are happy to tell you we have successfully transitioned to a new contractor who is now in full production. We also completed the move to the Gold Bar South pit and are now in full production in this pit. Gold production from Gold Bar has been on budget for the first two months of this year and we're looking forward to a good year from operations. At the Fenix project in Mexico, we have been able to develop an approach to get the Fenix project in production in a timely manner and at a significantly lower capital cost. We will reprocess the heap leach pad, which has a grade of 0.6 grams per tonne. To accomplish this, we have acquired a used 7,000 tonne per day gold processing plant, which operated recently at a local mining operation.We have moved 80% of this plant to our site. And for Fenix, we will initially assemble only the grinding circuit, the cyclones and the leaching portion of the plant and use the present El Gallo gold recovery circuit. This will reduce the CapEx to approximately $12 million with the potential to increase the throughput as we move into production and prove that this plant will give the required outputs. There are a few minor changes in our permits that are required, but we hope to have this plant operating late this year or early in 2024. With that, I thank you very much. And now I'll turn it over to Michael for an update on our world-class Los Azules project.Michael Meding: Thank you so much, Bill. I will quickly highlight our financing and strategic importance of our new shareholders, then report on our drilling, exploration and study work, and finally mention what we did last year and in 2023 concerning our enhanced organizational and ESG competence in Argentina. McEwen Copper completed $81.9 million offering, including a $25 million investment by Nuton, a Rio Tinto Venture, on August 31, 2022, followed on October 24, by an option agreement with Kennecott Exploration, another subsidiary of Rio Tinto, for potential earn in of 60% for Elder Creek by investing $18 million over seven years. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we announced the closing of an ARS30 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler Argentina, a subsidiary of Stellantis, to acquire shares of McEwen Copper and of a second investment of $30 million by Nuton that increased the investment to $55 million.Now, Nuton is an innovative new venture with the portfolio of proprietary copper heap leach related technologies and capabilities at the core, a product of almost 30 years of research and development. Those have the potential to economically unlock copper sulfide resources and achieve higher copper recoveries on oxide and transitional material. Rio Tinto is the world's second biggest mining company, bringing significant financial and technical resources to McEwen Copper and the Los Azules project. Stellantis, on the other hand, is one of the world's leading automakers. It produces iconic brands such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroen, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, Vauxhall and others. And in Argentina, Stellantis produces about 160,000 cars yearly, has about 3,000 employees and is present with manufacturing in Buenos Aires and in Cordoba, Argentina.Partnering with Stellantis is an expression of a paradigm shift for downstream customers of copper. Companies realize that copper is a mineral critical to the green energy and mobility transition. And to my knowledge, it's the first time an automotive company has invested in a copper company. Subsequent to those transactions, Stellantis and Nuton each own 14.2% of McEwen Copper. McEwen Mining's ownership is now approximately 52%. Now I'm going to talk about drilling, exploration, site and study work. A total of $41.3 million was incurred in 2022 at the Los Azules project to advance drilling, engineering and project feasibility work. Drilling has focused on increasing drill hole density to upgrade the copper mineral resource classification to measured and indicated and to define the payback pit design better, to provide metallurgical, hydrological and geotechnical data to support mine design and (ph) exploration testing for potential extensions of the copper resource to the north, south and the depth of this already vast deposit, which Mining Intelligence ranked in 2022 as the ninth largest undeveloped copper project by copper resource size.In 2022, drilling started in January and went to May when it stopped for the winter in the southern hemisphere, then restarted in October and is currently ongoing. Since October 2022, there were six drill rigs on site and five more were added in early 2023. From 2022 to date, we have drilled over 105,000 feet, approximately 32,000 meters, in 98 drill holes to increase geological confidence and we see that drill results are generally consistent with our model. Beyond our robust delineation results, published in January and March this year, we recently published our northern step-out exploration results with 1,052 meters of 0.29% copper including an interval of 480 meters of 0.42% copper, which demonstrates the potential of the deposits to the north.The updated PEA will include all available information on drilling, assay and metallurgical testing obtained until early 2023 and is now slated for publishing during Q2 this year. We are developing a scenario for Los Azules as an open pit mine that initially processes leachable copper content in a heap leach, with a solvent extraction and electro winning facility to produce copper cathodes. This scenario is more environmentally sensitive due to its much lower water consumption and carbon footprint, and is de risking the project due to lower complexity. The project design makes use of renewable energy, which will allow for low carbon footprint production and improves financial attractiveness. While the PEA as a base case considers economic leaching without Nuton technology, we are excited to be able to test heap leaching using their technology, which could represent a very interesting upside scenario, and initial results are promising.We are in preparation for the filing of the environmental permit application for the exploitation stage to the San Juan mining authorities. The drafting of the report is underway and on track for submitting it to the authorities in April 2023. In 2022, a major advance was made that will accelerate the development of the Los Azules project with the completion of a new low altitude access roads, which goes to a maximum of about 11,000 feet or approximately 3,400 meters above sea level, which we share in part with other mining projects, including El Pachon from Glencore and Altar from Aldebaran Resources. The importance of having a second road into the site at more than 2,000 feet low altitude means that we now have almost year-round access to the site.In addition, we upgraded the exploration roads, the former existing roads, to allow for articulated 18 wheelers to get to site, a significant logistics improvement, lowering costs and quickening transports. With regards to our organization, a strong and experienced management team was set up in Argentina in 2022. With management team members having a total of over 180 years of experience in Tier One operations, the majority in San Juan, Argentina where the project is located. To further cement our relations with local communities, we opened up our community affairs office in Calingasta in San Juan where the project is located, to have even closer relations with the community we are operating in. And I can report that we are happy to receive ongoing support to develop our project there.This concludes my report on McEwen Copper. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn it back over to Rob.Rob McEwen: Thanks, Michael. I'd like to say I've always felt that Los Azules was a tremendous asset for McEwen Mining. The problem was in 2022, our share price was scraping along the bottom and our treasury was small. But in order to advance Los Azules, we needed a lot of money. And the thought of trying to do a financing when we -- our share price was at historic lows was just not that attractive or possibly feasible. So, we decided the best way to advance Los Azules and build its value and surface the value for McEwen Mining and allow it to access financing was to create McEwen Copper and fund it separately. And I believe we have been successful in surfacing value. We've attracted the second largest mining company in the world as a shareholder and the fourth largest automobile manufacturer in the world.So, both did extensive due diligence on this, on Los Azules, and just confirming that we do have a very large, very attractive copper projects that will likely be one of the larger copper mines in the world when it is built. So, last August, we raised $82 million at a share price of $10. And now seven months later, we've completed an even larger financing of $30 million and ARS30 billion at an average price of approximately $18.75. As a result, the implied value of Los Azules has increased from $260 million to $550 million. And that's excluding the 1.25% royalty that McEwen Mining holds on this property. So, now behind every share of McEwen Mining, on a fully diluted basis, is a value of $5.70 from Los Azules. Back in mid-2020, our share price was around $3 a share.Looking ahead, with our operations performing much better than they have in the past, with prospects of growth at our Fox Complex where we can see the potential to double production and further reduce cost to below $900 an ounce; mining at Gold Bar, we're in a new deposit that is higher grade and lower strip, and assuming the winter doesn't frustrate our plans, we'll be increasing production by better than 50%; and we're looking at the Fox Complex increasing production anywhere from 15% to 30% and keeping its costs around a $1,000 an ounce, we're looking at 150,000 to 170,000 gold equivalent ounces, representing an increase between 13% to 28%. McEwen Mining trades at a significant discount to its peer group and our objective is to get up and exceed that peer group economic value for gold equivalent ounce.And when we do that, along with continuing to progress our Los Azules project, I think that the value behind McEwen Mining is going to increase and I see a value of somewhere between $7 and $28 a share. And you might be wondering how I got that number. There are -- and it's really the sum of the parts. We have Los Azules in there. And compared to two other copper projects in the same province in Argentina, we're at a lower altitude closer to the infrastructure, then they are roads powered. Based on the published resources, we have a larger resource and a higher copper grade than either of those two properties, yet, one has a value -- was purchased at $485 million last April and the other one has a market cap of about $1.9 billion. So, you could see -- I think we are in a position to be somewhere between that $500 million and $2 billion for the value for Los Azules.We have five royalties -- non-producing royalties, 1.25% on Los Azules, 1.25% on McEwen Coppers, other copper project, Elder Creek, which you heard earlier has been optioned by Rio's exploration arm Kennecott Copper, and then we have our gold assets that are trading well below our peer group. So, I think there's quite a bit of room to grow. And I think we're in really good position to push forward on that front. The investment that we have brought in recently into McEwen Copper, although it reduced our interest -- our ownership interest, it increased the value significantly of that asset. And it allowed us to reduce McEwen Mining's debt and put money in the treasury of McEwen Mining to further the development of our Fox Complex, expand down in Mexico and fund our exploration program.So, if any of you are interested in buying -- getting exposure to McEwen Copper, right now, the best way to do it is through the shares of McEwen Mining or wait for the IPO of McEwen Copper.

ISA member states are currently meeting in Kingston for talks with a view to finalising the rules by July.Norway is also considering opening parts of its extended continental shelf in the North Atlantic for mineral exploration.Loke said Norway's Kongsberg Gruppen, which provides technologies for offshore oil and gas and other industries, has taken a stake in it, joining TechnipFMC and Wilhelmsen.

Both instruments were trading close to their highest levels since early-January, and were up nearly 3% for the week.The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (NASDAQ:SIVB) and other smaller regional peers saw markets pile into gold this week. While government intervention and the bailout of other stressed lenders helped stem fears of contagion, markets still remained on edge over a broader banking crisis.This also saw traders significantly tone down expectations of more interest rate hikes by the Fed, ahead of a meeting next week. Markets are pricing in a nearly 90% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points (bps), smaller than prior expectations for a 50 bps hike.This notion weighed on the dollar, which also benefited metal markets. But the greenback pared a bulk of its losses this week, helped by some safe haven demand and as some U.S. inflation data read stronger-than-expected for February.Relatively high inflation puts more pressure on the Fed to hike interest rates. Focus is now squarely on the bank’s meeting next week, which is also expected to provide more cues on monetary policy.Rising interest rates push up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, and had battered metal markets through 2022.Other precious metals firmed on Friday, and were set to end the week higher.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on QUALCOMM's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:63% = US$12b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.63.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 63% ROETo begin with, QUALCOMM has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, QUALCOMM's considerable five year net income growth of 54% was to be expected.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that QUALCOMM's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 28% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for QCOM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is QUALCOMM Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?QUALCOMM's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 33%, meaning the company retains 67% of its income. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like QUALCOMM is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, QUALCOMM has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 29%. Regardless, QUALCOMM's ROE is speculated to decline to 37% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with QUALCOMM's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

ISA member states are currently meeting in Kingston for talks with a view to finalising the rules by July.Norway is also considering opening parts of its extended continental shelf in the North Atlantic for mineral exploration.Loke said Norway's Kongsberg Gruppen, which provides technologies for offshore oil and gas and other industries, has taken a stake in it, joining TechnipFMC and Wilhelmsen.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned -1.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $26.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.12 indicates a change of +4.8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $14.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.1%. The $65.8 billion and $67.74 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.3% and +3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $18.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $7.79 for the same period compares with $7.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.06%. The EPS surprise was +5.13%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).26 Companies that Donate to NonprofitsPixabay/Public domainOur MethodologyWe started off by finding as many companies as we could with nonprofit donation initiatives.

Furthermore, it is home to Wall Street, which is the world's leading financial center.Although it is already one of the most developed countries in the world, the United States has a lot of growth potential in the future.For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.The United States has substantial population growth potential.The United States leads in AI which could help produce many innovative breakthroughs that increase domestic and potentially world GDP.Many multinational American companies also have substantial emerging market operations that could help with earnings growth in the future.Many leading American blue chips also pay a dividend and also buy back stock when they have excess capital.Near Term HeadwindsThe American economy is slowing currently.Recently, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank by assets in the country, failed in a few days given the bank failed to successfully raise enough equity that it needed and customers withdrew substantial deposits.Fearing contagion, the U.S. government stepped in to protect deposits at Silicon Valley Bank.CNBC said, ""Banking regulators devised a plan Sunday to backstop depositors with money at Silicon Valley Bank, a critical step in stemming a feared systemic panic brought on by the collapse of the tech-focused institution.""Although the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank are protected, the equity shareholders of the bank aren't and the failure worsened confidence in other banks, which could have ripple effects on U.S. economic growth.Story continuesWith the failure and the higher interest rates, there is potential for the U.S. economy to slow even further and as a result, the near term is pretty uncertain in the United States. Furthermore, if the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of stocks purchased in U.S. dollars could decrease, all else equal.Despite the near term headwinds which could lead to lower stock prices if economic data fails to meet expectations, the long term potential growth of leading blue chips in the United States is still pretty attractive. The United States has the world's leading economy, leads the world in innovation currently, and will likely remain the world's innovation leader in the future. With more innovation, there could be more total value created and many of today's leading blue chips in America could benefit as a result.For those of you interested check out 12 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy.Given individual companies can fail as Silicon Valley Bank showed and sectors can also underperform, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real Estate, InvestmentPhoto by Frans Ruiter on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners, we picked 15 stocks with competitive advantages that have headquarters in the United States and that are listed in either the NYSE or the NASDAQ.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners15. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is one of the biggest asset managers in the world that has a lot of scale and competitive advantages.

(NYSE:HD) is one of the leading home improvement retailers in the world. While the company's customer base has been fairly resilient for most of fiscal 2022 with less price sensitivity than what would normally be expected given the persistent inflation, the company's fourth quarter 2022 comparables were slightly softer than anticipated. Given the rising interest rates and the potential for an economic slowdown, the company expects weaker demand in the near term as well. In February, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) said it saw FY23 revenue flat, and FY23 EPS down mid-single digits percentage range. Nevertheless, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has growth potential in the long term given the rising equity value of the total homes in the United States.13. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the leading discount retailers in the world with substantial scale. In fact, as of the end of FY2022, the company operated 10,635 total retail units globally, with 4,717 Walmart stores in the United States and 5,318 Walmart International stores. Walmart Inc.

While the company thinks there could be a 'slight decline' in the home improvement market in 2023, Lowe's Companies, Inc.

In the long term, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is still attractive given its strong brands and potential earnings power if inflation eventually normalizes.9. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks #9 on our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners given 74 hedge funds in our database owned shares of the leading investment bank at the end of Q4. Given the company's headwinds in the consumer sector, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Going forward, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) hopes to grow its wealth and asset management business which generated $8.8 billion in management and other fees in 2022 and is expected to generate over $10 billion in management and other fees in 2024.8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a leading healthcare company that has faced headwinds given inflation and higher interest rates which have led to some lower valuations for leading stocks.

In terms of Disney+, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) CEO Robert Iger recently said, ""In our zeal to grow global subs, I think we were off in terms of that pricing strategy, and we're now starting to learn more about it and to adjust accordingly,"" meaning the company could potentially raise prices.

To skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Medium Term.While some investors prefer to hold long-term positions in the stocks they pile into, others take notice of company fundamentals and other factors to hold short-term positions in stocks. The practice of holding positions in stocks for a shorter time period before exiting them is known as medium-term trading. This strategy often enables investors to keep their portfolios active while cutting out stocks that perform poorly, so they can reinvest in better companies. It also maximizes investors' return on capital since profits from successful trades enable them to reinvest in stocks with higher growth potential.To successfully implement this strategy, investors must look at certain factors in the companies they choose. These include share performance over a 12-month period, company profits, sales, debt, price-to-earnings ratio, and dividends. It also helps to consider companies' revenue growth rates and payout ratios, in the case of dividend stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). With high revenue growth and low payout ratios, investors can actively ensure the companies they choose for medium-term trading are performing well and managing their earnings smartly in a way that enables their own growth while keeping shareholders satisfied.One major reason to consider dividend stocks for medium-term trading is that these stocks offer passive income to investors for the short period they hold a position in them. However, another reason to consider these stocks is that dividend-paying companies are an effective investment in times of market uncertainty. According to a Lord Abbett report published in July, dividend stocks have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index between 1973 and 2022. Research has shown that dividends have contributed to over 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return between December 1929 and May 2022. Within these stocks, those that grow their dividends have markedly outperformed all other dividend stocks. And when it comes to periods when market returns are below average, dividends have been seen to provide a cushion for investors that offsets a stock's price depreciation. The research further indicates that in every decade where the market's annualized returns fell below 10%, dividends contributed about 76% of the S&amp;P 500's total return. Resultantly, dividend stocks have proven themselves to be attractive stock picks for investors in times of market volatility, which is why we have recommended dividend-paying companies in our list below.Story continues10 Best Stocks to Buy for Medium TermPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 10 best stocks to buy for medium term.Our MethodologyWe have selected dividend-paying stocks with payout ratios below 30% for our list below.

138,ae2b7f6f-0ca5-4b00-b832-9dd14802f5d0,JNJ,2023-03-17,CMS releases 'bombshell' guidance draft of Medicare drug price negotiations,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cms-releases-bombshell-guidance-draft-of-medicare-drug-price-negotiations-144423968.html,1678977863,STORY,['JNJ'],"[The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released new guidance late Wednesday outlining its criteria for its newly granted powers to negotiate drug prices for Part D beneficiaries.The ability to negotiate comes from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and is the second notable action the agency took this week — the first being penalties for drug companies that increased prices faster than inflation of Medicare Part B drugs.In the 91-page document outlining the new Part D drug guidance, CMS reiterates much of what is outlined in IRA, including the definition of which drugs would qualify, which excludes drugs that are the single available option for a specific disease (known as orphan drugs), as well as drugs from smaller biotech companies (a definition which is still being finalized, and companies will be annually assessed).But there are also new details as to what Medicare will be considering when it negotiates the maximum fair price (MFP). Drugs that are the original brands for biosimilars (a biologic medical product that is almost an identical copy of a product manufactured by a different company), and biosimilars themselves, will not be considered. But generics, copies of synthetic drugs, will be. It will be possible to delay a negotiation for certain reasons, and there will be a resolution process set up for any disputes.In this photo illustration, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone and on the background of its website. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The document also outlines that the agency will first identify the top 50 most expensive drugs to Medicare, and then whittle away to the top 10 based on the various criteria laid out in the finalized guidance.CMS Deputy Administrator and Director of Medicare Dr. Meena Seshamani also outlined a few key dates in the document. In September, the agency will reveal the first 10 drugs that will be negotiated. There will be a public comment, with input accepted by April 14, among others.Experts had mixed reviews about the guidance, ranging from calling it a White House public relations stunt to being impressed with the depth of detail the guidance was providing.Story continuesJoseph Levy, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Yahoo Finance the guidance is adding clarity to what was deemed a very vague law (IRA).But, Levy says there is potential for confusion, especially as the prices being set also include multiple variables such as alternative therapies, and their prices, what other federal agencies are paying, as well as all dosages and forms of a product being grouped together.Kaiser Family Foundation's deputy director of Medicare policy, Juliette Cubanski, said that while she is still wading through the 91-page document, her initial reaction was the guidance provides a much clearer roadmap for companies.""At the same time, CMS is soliciting feedback on several pieces of this guidance, so it can’t yet be read as the final word on how the negotiation program will be implemented for 2026 – meaning there is plenty of opportunity for manufacturers and other stakeholders to weigh in on elements of this guidance,"" Cubanski added.Seshamani has acknowledged publicly that she and her team have met regularly with all stakeholders, including drug companies, advocacy groups, patients and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) to walk through guidance language.SVB Securities analysts called the document a ""bombshell,"" saying that they expect shares of exposed companies to be under pressure — including Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ).Because having biosimilars appears to be a loophole for companies to use — which ideally leads to a competitive market and lower prices anyway — SVB suggests companies could engage in settlements with biosimilar manufacturers to launch ahead of the negotiations year. But CMS could close the loophole in its final version of the guidance.Levy said the biosimilar guidance follows mounting evidence that ""as more biosimilars come to market, payers are being more aggressive in requiring the use of biosimilars, in some cases, (and) biosimilars coming on the market is driving down the net price of both the originator biologic and the biosimilar.""Another point the analysts made is that CMS could publish a list sooner than September, as the final deadline is September 1, 2023.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

To skip our detailed analysis of ChatGPT and developments in artificial intelligence, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks ChatGPT Says Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years.One of the biggest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) seen so far is the emergence of ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots. ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI, an AI research and deployment company. The chatbot uses deep learning techniques to generate responses to text inputs in the form of a conversation with the user. Ever since its release, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, making researchers, users, and even investors even more curious about the artificial intelligence sector and what it has to offer.AI was first deployed in the finance sector years ago, but the speed of its incorporation in the sector was sped up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, it is expected that AI in finance will drive competitive advantages for financial firms. According to a report published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2021, AI can improve firms' efficiency through cost reduction and productivity enhancement, leading to higher profitability. It can also enhance the quality of financial services and products. Because of the benefits AI offers to the financial sector, global spending on AI in the private sector has been steadily increasing. Between 2020 and 2024, spending on AI was forecast to rise from $50.1 billion in 2020 to over $110 billion in 2024.Picking Stocks Using AIA recent example of AI deployment in the finance sector can be found in the ETF arena. According to a Bloomberg article published in January, the AI Powered Equity ETF is a $102 million ETF that managed to return about 9.9% in January 2023, while the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index returned a mere 4.7%. The ETF uses a quantitative model to assess over 6,000 American publicly-traded companies. Even before this more recent development, AI deployment was seen in the finance sector. A BarclayHedge Hedge Fund Sentiment Survey conducted in 2018 found that 56% of hedge fund respondents had used AI to inform their investment decisions. Hedge funds have been using AI to analyze data and forecast market movements for tactical asset allocation for years now. Some hedge funds known to use machine learning and AI algorithms in their business include Cerebellum Capital, Aidiya Holdings, and Taaffeite Capital Management.Story continuesThe AI RaceApart from the finance sector, public companies in the tech sector, such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have also been joining the AI frenzy to keep up with changing trends. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), for instance, has begun incorporating generative AI technology in its Bing search engine. In competition, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also announced plans to integrate the same technology into its own search engine. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has also been working with generative AI, attributing its increasing business to consumer demand for this technology in their networks. According to the Wall Street Journal in an article published this March, Broadcom Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO, Hock Tan, expects sales from the company's Ethernet switch products deployed for AI uses to exceed $800 million in 2023, compared to $200 million in 2022. Tan also commented that the company's revenues from its compute offload accelerated business will also hit $3 billion in the fiscal year of 2023, compared to $2 billion the year before.Additionally, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is not alone in its attempts to capitalize on the recent AI boom. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), another chip maker, has also recently announced the rise of a new business aiming to provide greater access to AI software tools. These are merely a few examples of how companies across the globe, public and private, are swept away by the AI craze. With ChatGPT being one of the primary reasons behind this, we have attempted to use this AI chatbot to generate a list of profitable stocks to invest in to see just how far AI has advanced.Photo by Levart_Photographer on UnsplashLet's now take a look at 10 stocks ChatGPT says will make me rich in 10 years.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks in our list below, we used several prompts on ChatGPT to make the AI language model provide us with a list of 10 stocks that it thinks can make investors rich in 10 years. We asked ChatGPT to think of itself as a professional stock analyst, and consider all information available to it to come up with this list. After that, we ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked. They are thus ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors.Stocks ChatGPT Says Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years10.

140,7d167d0c-d5b7-30d1-9553-8a8b8b1a3c31,MDT,2023-03-17,Is Medtronic plc's (NYSE:MDT) Stock Price Struggling As A Result Of Its Mixed Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plcs-nyse-mdt-stock-130025001.html,1678971625,STORY,['MDT'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.0% over the past month. It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Specifically, we decided to study Medtronic's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Medtronic How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:7.9% = US$4.1b ÷ US$52b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Medtronic's Earnings Growth And 7.9% ROEAt first glance, Medtronic's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 11%. Although, we can see that Medtronic saw a modest net income growth of 6.1% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Medtronic's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 16% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Medtronic's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Medtronic Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Medtronic has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 75%, meaning that it is left with only 25% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Additionally, Medtronic has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 52% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Medtronic's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 14%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Medtronic's performance. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty respectable, the low profit retention could mean that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been paying reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. An improvement in its ROE could also help future earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Crown Castle Crown Castle's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Crown Castle has grown EPS by 29% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It's noted that Crown Castle's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. The music to the ears of Crown Castle shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 32% to 35% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Crown Castle's future profits.Are Crown Castle Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Crown Castle, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$283m. We note that this amounts to 0.5% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Crown Castle but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Crown Castle Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Crown Castle's strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Still, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Crown Castle (including 2 which shouldn't be ignored).There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

142,cfba78c3-8059-3baf-8481-64004d316c5d,RSG,2023-03-17,7 Stocks to Buy Now if the Fed Raises Rates,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-fed-210728034.html,1678741648.0,STORY,"['SRE', 'AWK', 'RSG', 'DG', 'PGR']","[Although it’s no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark interest rates, it may be an inevitability, thus sparking interest in stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Early last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left open the door for higher and quicker rate hikes. Essentially, economic data came in hotter than anticipated, leading to stubbornly high inflation. In Powell’s view, rising prices must be curbed to avoid long-term economic consequences.More recently, the U.S. economy added 311,000 jobs in February, outpacing expectations. Typically, countries aim for strong employment. However, too strong of a labor market implies more dollars chasing after fewer goods (i.e. inflation). Unfortunately, then, Powell may have little choice but to tighten the money supply. If that happens, investors can anticipate a significant impact to the equities sector, greatly affecting stocks to buy for rising interest rates. To stay ahead of the curve, investors may want to adjust their portfolios before the seemingly inevitable arrives. With that in mind, below are relevant stocks to buy for rising interest rates.PGRProgressive$139.53SRESempra Energy$143.97DGDollar General$216.80RSGRepublic Services$128.40AWKAmerican Water Works$136.37PSXPhillips 66$95.52KRKroger$46.85InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsProgressive (PGR)A photo of the Progressive logo on the side of a building.Source: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.comOn paper, rising interest rates should help insurance giant Progressive (NYSE:PGR). According to the Office of Financial Research, “[m]odestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry. When rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. With these new, higher-yielding corporate and other bond purchases, insurers’ investment earnings also increase.” However, that’s not the whole story. For instance, higher-than-expected claim costs may impair insurers’ earnings. Fortunately, that’s not the reason why I consider PGR one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Rather, I like Progressive because it cynically benefits from a captive audience. Put another way, you really can’t drive without a minimum level of insurance coverage.Story continuesTo be fair, PGR appears overvalued. That said, since the January opener, PGR gained 8% of its equity value. And in the trailing 365 days, it’s up over 33%. Why? Fundamentally, I believe investors recognize the coming influx of demand. As society normalizes and traffic level returns to and even exceeds pre-pandemic norms, traffic incidents will rise. Again, it’s cynical but here we are.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you want another dose of cynicism with your stocks to buy, look no further than utility firm Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). At the most basic level, Sempra and its ilk benefit from a concept called a natural monopoly. Because competing in the underlying industry requires overcoming a massive barrier to entry, most enterprises don’t even try. Therefore, Sempra stands largely alone in its market.And what a lucrative market it is. Covering swathes of Southern California, if you want to live in places like San Diego, you got to pay up. One of the beneficiaries happens to be Sempra Energy. Sure, people can always move out and relocate to, say, South Carolina. But for many Americans – and people across the globe – Southern California represents a “grail” region. Put another way, Sempra likely benefits from permanent relevance. That’s why I’m not as concerned about the less-than-ideal financials. Sempra doesn’t have the greatest stability in the balance sheet and its revenue growth is so-so. However, it’s consistently profitable, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Dollar General (DG)a figure of a shopper standing on top of a credit cardSource: ShutterstockFor the topic of stocks to buy for rising interest rates, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) practically sells itself. True, at the moment, the robust jobs market suggests that few consumers would consider shopping at dollar discount stores. However, with the Fed committed to tackling stubbornly elevated inflation, it’s almost inevitable that mass layoffs will materialize. At that point, DG would become extremely relevant.Further, with the banking sector suffering from sharp losses recently, we may have to put aside the idea of a soft landing. Indeed, we should be grateful for any landing that doesn’t involve heavy casualties. Still, somehow or another, the Fed will control inflation. That determination bodes poorly for the wider economy. However, it could be cynically beneficial for Dollar General.Also, DG enjoys several positive fiscal attributes. First, Gurufocus.com notes that DG is modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV). Objectively, the discount retailer enjoys a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 14.6%. As well, its net margin stands at 6.49%, outpacing 89% of the competition.Republic Services (RSG)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRWithout question, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) is one of the boring entries among stocks to buy for rising interest rates. As a waste disposal and management specialist, Republic doesn’t exactly offer a groundbreaking business. At the same time, it’s part of society’s infrastructure. During times of trouble, Republic may shine bright.That’s because no matter how advanced we become, someone has to take out the trash. While it might not be politically correct, you don’t see too many academic administrators encouraging their students to enter the waste disposal business. But again, someone has to do it; otherwise, the piling up of trash may cause severe health problems, among other concerns.Given the essential nature of the business, RSG easily ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Further, the company enjoys attractive financial metrics. Operationally, Republic’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, outpacing 61% of its peers. In addition, its net margin pings at 11%, above 72.35% of the industry.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company offers these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states, serving a population of roughly 14 million. Because of the steep barriers to entry, American Water benefits from a natural monopoly status.Cynically, then, AWK makes an excellent case for stocks to buy for rising interest rates. It’s possible that the Fed could take off the kiddie gloves, aggressively raising borrowing costs. In turn, we could see an acceleration in layoffs. However, skimping on core utility bills would be the last thing on households’ to-do lists. Beyond the “positive” narrative, AWK enjoys encouraging financial data. First, Gurufocus.com identifies AWK as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations. In terms of the bottom line, the company is consistently profitable. Over the trailing year, its net margin stands at 21.62%, above 87.61% of sector players.Phillips 66 (PSX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) also features a narrative for stocks to buy for rising interest rates that sells itself. For one thing, politicians can scream all they want about the electrification of mobility. Over the next several years, combustion-powered vehicles will remain relevant. Mainly, it comes down to cost as electric vehicles tend to be pricier than their combustion-powered counterparts.More importantly, society has started to normalize rapidly. We see that through a growing number of companies recalling their workers back to the office. Not only that, with layoffs – particularly in the high-paying tech space – also rising, employees can’t afford to confront their employees. Translation? Greater traffic volume on U.S. roadways.As I mentioned earlier, this dynamic should help Progressive. It will almost certainly help Phillips 66, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Lastly, Wall Street analysts believe in PSX, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $128.20, implying nearly 27% upside potential.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFor the last idea for stocks to buy for rising interest rates, I’m going with the obvious in grocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR). Obviously, humans require a minimum amount of calorie consumption; otherwise, things just don’t work well. Interestingly, KR represented one of the top performers last week, gaining nearly 3%. For the year, KR is up almost 6%.That’s significant because the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index only gained 1% on a year-to-date basis. Fundamentally, Kroger benefits from being on the lower rungs of the trade-down effect. In other words, when consumers face financial pressures, they’ll cut out discretionary spending first. This means frivolous categories such as premium fine-dining establishments stand at risk of revenue volume loss.With Kroger, people are unlikely to cut into spending there because not many cheaper alternatives exist. Further, the company benefits from certain positive financial metrics. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.3%, outflanking 76.68% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 8.6%. Not surprisingly, Kroger also enjoys a consistently profitable business. As pressures rise, you should consider KR as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

KeyVibe-002 is evaluating MK-7684A, a coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT therapy, and pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, with or without docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. KeyVibe-002, a partially blinded study, was designed with two primary objectives: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of MK-7684A alone compared with docetaxel, a standard of care; and 2) in a blinded assessment, evaluate the efficacy of adding MK-7684A to docetaxel compared with docetaxel alone.Results from the open-label arm of the study evaluating MK-7684A alone showed that the coformulation did not reach statistical significance for the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) and was numerically less effective compared with docetaxel. Merck is notifying study investigators that patients in this arm of the study should be switched to a standard of care, unless their physician considers the patient is benefitting from MK-7684A alone.The blinded arms of the study will continue to further evaluate MK-7684A with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. The safety profile of MK-7684A was consistent with that observed for vibostolimab and pembrolizumab in previously reported studies, with no new safety signals observed. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting once further data from the blinded study arms are available.Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating the safety and efficacy of MK-7684A alone and in combination with other agents in over 4,000 patients. Ongoing Phase 3 studies in lung cancer include KeyVibe-003, KeyVibe-006, KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008, as well as KeyVibe-010 in melanoma.Story continues""Through different approaches, such as novel combinations and coformulations, we hope to build on the foundation of KEYTRUDA to help even more patients with cancer,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study evaluating MK-7684A in a heavily pre-treated group of patients, and look forward to additional data from the continuation of the blinded arms of KeyVibe-002. Based on responses we have seen in the signal-finding Phase 1/2 program to date, we are moving forward with our comprehensive research program evaluating MK-7684A across a wide range of cancers, including lung, other solid tumors and blood cancers.""About KeyVibe-002KeyVibe-002 is a randomized, partially blind Phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04725188) evaluating MK-7684A, a coformulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab, with or without docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The trial’s primary endpoint is PFS, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST) v1.1. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response (OR), as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1. The study enrolled 255 patients who were randomly assigned in three separate study arms (1:1:1) to receive either:Arm 1 (Open-label): MK-7684A (pembrolizumab 200 mg plus vibostolimab 200mg/20 mL intravenously [IV] every three weeks [Q3W] until a discontinuation criterion is met or completion of 35 cycles), or;Arm 2 (Blinded): MK-7684A (pembrolizumab 200 mg plus vibostolimab 200mg/20 mL IV Q3W until a discontinuation criterion is met or completion of 35 cycles) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m^2, IV Q3W until a discontinuation criterion is met or as per approved local label), or;Arm 3 (Placebo-blinded): Placebo (saline IV Q3W) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m^2, IV Q3W until a discontinuation criterion is met or as per approved local label).KeyVibe-002, a non-registrational study, was designed with two primary objectives: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of MK-7684A alone compared with docetaxel, a standard of care; and 2) in a blinded assessment, evaluate the efficacy of adding MK-7684A to docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone.About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About vibostolimabVibostolimab is a humanized anti-TIGIT therapy discovered and developed by Merck. Vibostolimab restores antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands (CD112 and CD155), thereby activating T lymphocytes that help destroy tumor cells. MK-7684A is a coformulation of both vibostolimab and pembrolizumab and is being evaluated in a wide range of cancers, including lung, other solid tumors and blood cancers.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

With 52% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Boeing. See our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Boeing. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Boeing's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Boeing is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.7% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of BoeingWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Boeing Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$73m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Boeing  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.Aerospace manufacturers Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Bell will hold meetings with state-owned Vietnamese defence procurement companies, Thanh told Reuters, adding that it was the first time in about a decade that security firms had decided to join the annual mission to Vietnam.In December, the same companies held talks with Vietnamese government officials about the possible sale of helicopters and drones, as the country seeks new suppliers and the Ukraine conflict strains the capabilities of Russia, for decades Vietnam's main military partner.""Helicopters is one of the things the companies hope to sell to the Vietnamese,"" Thanh said, although he cautioned that defence deals took time to be completed and no immediate breakthrough was expected.Boeing said in a statement that its discussions with officials would focus on its growing partnership with Vietnam and ways to strengthen the country's aviation and defence capabilities.Story continuesLockheed Martin and Bell did not respond to requests for comment.The majority of the companies joining the business mission already have a business or manufacturing presence in Vietnam, including Apple, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Thanh said, with some planning to expand it.Some companies are also coming to get a better sense of the political situation after recent turmoil in the Communist-Party led country, including the resignation of the president in January, Thanh added.Participants will have meetings with Vietnam's top political and regulatory leadership, including with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.Thanh said some companies were interested in Vietnam as a manufacturing hub and in providing services to increasingly wealthy consumers at a time when economic growth reached more than 8% last year.Among them is SpaceX, which is looking to sell its satellite internet services to Vietnam and other countries in the region, Thanh said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.The mission will also include semiconductors companies, pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, medical device maker Abbott, financial firms Visa and Citibank, internet and cloud companies Meta and Amazon Web Services, the list showed.(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

155,af160d64-7acc-3271-8e33-1baf89ec76fc,MAA,2023-03-17,3 Residential REITs to Consider Despite Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-residential-reits-consider-despite-141402390.html,1678976042,STORY,"['AVB', 'MAA-PI', '^GSPC', 'ELME']","[The REIT And Equity Trust - Residential Industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of macroeconomic uncertainties in the near term. Elevated deliveries, the lack of rental relief payments and regulatory issues are expected to add to the woes. High real estate taxes and insurance costs are likely to add to cost pressures. A hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Nevertheless, residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. AVB, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA and Elme Communities ELME are poised to benefit. Renting apartment units is a viable option as mortgage rates are high and the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult with the high costs of homeownership. Also, residential REITs are banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of their operating platforms.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region. Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, the enrolment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.What's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Macroeconomic Uncertainties: The residential REIT industry constituents face headwinds from a softening of the economy in the current year. A slowing economy is likely to cast a pall on leasing activity, and affect rental rate growth and occupancy level. The impacts of the slowdown are likely to be more profound in case of a slowing economy during the peak leasing season than later in the year.Elevated Deliveries of New Units: While supply-chain issues and labor challenges have impacted construction activity to some extent in the past quarters, deliveries of new units are likely to accelerate in a number of markets in the upcoming quarters, as the ongoing construction activity remains high, resulting in a struggle on the part of landlords to lure renters. The elevated new supply is likely to weigh on rental rates and the occupancy level of residential REITs’ properties.Lack of Rental Relief Payments and Cost Pressure: Growth in revenues of residential REITs is likely to be affected by bad debt, given the lack of rental relief payments in 2023. Moreover, amid an inflationary environment, residential REITs are facing higher cost pressure, with utilities, payroll, and repair and maintenance costs remaining elevated. Adding to the woes are property taxes and insurance, which are not only high but also volatile. Given the frequency and severity of several disasters over the past couple of years, there is greater pressure on insurance rates. Also, for real estate taxes, municipal fiscal pressures are driving the growth rate.Complicated Regulatory Environment: With growing focus by state and local, and in certain cases federal and governmental authorities, the regulatory environment for rental housing continues to be complex. Particularly, the rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent-control or rent-stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees.Higher Interest Rates: The hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes. However, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting apartment units a viable option.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend. Residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, and enhancing customer experience. The REITs are focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in processes, and process enhancements. Improvements in search and tour bookings, as well as smart home access, have gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on the same. Such efforts aim to generate incremental net operating income in the years ahead.Rebound in Demand for Student Housing Properties: There has been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. Rent growth hit another high in the Fall 2023 pre-leasing season, per a RealPage report.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #161, which places it at the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the downward funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s FFO per share estimates for 2023 and 2024 have moved down 6.1% and 1.5%, respectively.However, before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 28.5% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 12.6% and the broader Finance sector’s dip of 15.4%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.94X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 15.99X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector’s forward 12-month P/E of 12.88X. This is shown in the chart below.Forward 12-Month Price-to-FFO (P/FFO) RatioOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.48X and as low as 15.15X, with a median of 18.96X.3 Residential REIT Stocks Trying to Survive Industry ChallengesElme Communities is a multi-family real estate investment trust that owns and operates apartment homes principally in the Washington, DC, metro and the Sunbelt regions.The REIT’s portfolio allocation to the Washington metro offers insulation from employment loss. Also, its mid-level rents offer protection from new supply woes.Elme Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year FFO per share of 99 cents suggests a 12.5% year-over-year increase, backed by 11.4% growth in revenues. The company’s shares have gained 0.8% in the past three months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. AvalonBay Communities primarily focuses on developing, redeveloping, acquiring and managing apartment communities in the leading metropolitan areas in New England, the New York/New Jersey Metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California, as well as in its expansion markets of Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte, NC; Southeast Florida; Dallas and Austin, TX; and Denver, CO.AvalonBay Communities is poised to benefit from high-quality assets in the premium markets, and portfolio diversification among the urban and suburban markets. In its first-quarter 2023 operating update, AvalonBay Communities reported a 10.5% increase in same-store residential rental revenues for the two months ended Feb 28, 2023, compared with the prior-year period. This is in sync with the company’s initial expectation, which was published on Feb 8, 2023.AVB reported that the economic occupancy for its same-store residential communities improved to 96.2% in February from 95.8% in January 2023. The like-term effective rent change for same-store residential communities improved to 4.2% in February from 3.7% in January.AvalonBay Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its ongoing-year FFO per share has been revised marginally upward in the past week. The company’s shares have appreciated 4.8% in the past three months.Mid-America Apartment Communities is headquartered in Germantown, TN, and is commonly known as MAA. This residential REIT is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Mid-America Apartment Communities’ well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. The favorable in-migration trends of jobs and households in SunBelt submarkets are likely to fuel demand. We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenues, going forward. The prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to expand margins. Its solid balance sheet acts as a tailwind.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The recent trend in estimate revision indicates a favorable outlook for MAA. Particularly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past month to $9.17. The company’s shares have declined 2.9% in the past three months.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Nasdaq Bank Index is down more than 20% from its Feb. high due to its exposure to the now-delisted SIVB stock. Meanwhile, startups and growth names are also starting to feel the pressure, as nearly half of all U.S. tech startups have exposure to this bank. The bottom line is that tough times are ahead for the stock market. Even if the financial institutions deal with the ripple effects, a terminal rate above 5% will definitely have some negative implications. However, there are still some top stocks to buy in the chaos.And as long as you have cash on hand, it is best to take a contrarian approach and start capitalizing on the discounts. You may have to absorb some short-term losses, but by panning through a historical stock market chart, it is easy to realize that tough times are golden opportunities. By buying some of the top stocks to buy, investors can position themselves for massive returns when the market roars back.

The catalyst at play here is its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, which investors worry could cause issues for the company. However, Reuters reports, “Sunrun has cash deposits with SVB totaling nearly $80 million, while SVB’s undrawn commitment in the non-recourse senior aggregation warehouse facility is about $40 million.” That’s a lot of money, but Sunrun had $740.5 million in cash at the end of 2022.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn the other hand, SVB closing down does hurt Sunrun’s funding, but the impact here is limited. There are many banks that’ll gladly take SVB’s spot as the risk with Sunrun’s business model is relatively low, and they get to improve their ESG scores as a bonus.Story continuesTherefore, the selloff looks overdone. The business has excellent growth prospects and deserves a much higher premium over the coming years. Environmental problems are also among the government’s top priorities, and it’s unlikely that Sunrun won’t receive support if it ever gets in trouble. Regardless, the Fed’s bailout means a very strong rebound due for RUN stock after the SVB catalyst is priced in.Stocks to Buy: Fiverr (FVRR)Newspapers: everyday searching for job and business opportunities. February Jobs ReportSource: Mykola Komarovskyy / Shutterstock.comFiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is a global online marketplace that connects entrepreneurs and freelancers to provide a variety of services, from graphic design to coding and marketing, at prices as low as $5. The company’s business model is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding freelance market, with more companies adopting the gig economy as a cost-effective alternative to hiring full-time workers.Fiverr’s user-friendly platform has resulted in remarkable customer retention, with spending per buyer growing by 8% year-over-year. While the company is not yet profitable due to its significant marketing expenditures, it has a loyal customer base and a management team focused on growth while keeping losses tolerable. As the company captures more market share in the burgeoning gig industry, its top line is expected to continue to grow at a healthy clip, making it one of the hottest stocks in the coming years.However, in its Q4 press release, the company stated, “For revenue, we expect Q1’23 to be the most challenging quarter in terms of year-over-year growth rate, due to the comparison to Q1’22 when growth was minimally impacted by macro headwinds. We expect year-over-year revenue growth rates to increase over the course of 2023 and we expect to exit 2023 with double-digit revenue growth rate at the midpoint.”Regardless of the near-term outlook, the company’s remarkable customer retention and continual reinvestment in itself suggest significant potential for long-term growth. With its cash reserves growing annually, FVRR is a multi-bagger investment that could generate substantial profits in the coming years.Stocks to Buy: CrowdStrike (CRWD)internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecuritySource: Song_about_summer / ShutterstockCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that is starting to pick up some momentum after reaching low valuations. It beat its Q4 earnings-per-share estimates by 10.4% and grew its top line by 47.9% YoY. Net profit margin also rose by 23.5% but remains in negative territory. These trends are positively affecting the outlook of the company. Especially considering cybersecurity is expected to be a $376.3 billion market by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 13.4%. And so far, the company is rapidly capturing this addressable market. CrowdStrike’s 3-Year Revenue growth rate is among the strongest in the industry at 43.5%. That’s better than 91.75% of its peers. Its EBITDA growth of 39.3% is also better than 83.2% of the competition.By the end of this year, the company expects “total revenue to be in the range of $674.9 million to $678.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 38% to 39%.” That sort of growth deserves a much higher premium.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is a business you shouldn’t ignore at its current valuation. The company is set to rebound due to the government’s focus on expanding telecommunications infrastructure, especially 5G. While Verizon’s 5G network is less extensive than its competitors, the company is covering significant ground and outpacing its competitors. Verizon seeks to cover at least 250 million people within the next two years and will likely have the broadest coverage in a few years. Back to valuations, VZ stock is changing hands at just 7.8 times forward earnings, yielding 7.1%. That’s a massive bargain, even if you consider the expectation of EBITDA shrinking to $47.5 billion this year as total wireless service revenue still grows at a healthy clip. In a few years, I believe this company will benefit from much more than just 5G.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a semiconductor company, one which Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can’t get enough of.

Of course, that does mean that any ripples in Apple will cause problems for SWKS, but its current discounted valuation isn’t something investors should ignore.For one, Apple has among the deepest pockets and very high product demand. The company had much less cost-cutting than its competitors, and inflation has little impact on its customer base. Thus, SWKS shouldn’t be as under-appreciated for its association with Apple while it boasts a net margin better than 81% of its competitors. As Gurufocus.com notes, it is significantly undervalued with a lot more room to run.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is well-positioned to be the largest beneficiary of surging military budgets worldwide. The company already had a backlog of $150 billion by the end of last quarter, up 11%. That indicates that demand is indeed accelerating, and investors will likely put a more premium price tag on the stock as the geopolitical scene keeps heating up.There is also a massive share repurchase program, with Lockheed Martin returning $5 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in Q4. That’s almost half of the $10.9 billion returned in all of 2022. Going forward, I believe even more will be returned as the company still had $6.1 billion left in operating cash last year.Moreover, as NATO increases its defense budget and countries like Japan, Australia, and Taiwan boost their budgets, Lockheed Martin is set to be among the largest beneficiaries of this trend. Lockheed Martin’s role in the aerospace industry is also worth noting, particularly its significant business in satellite manufacturing. With all that in mind, LMT is among the top stocks with good potential.Northrop Grumman (NOC)United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.Source: viper-zero / Shutterstock.comMuch like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is another defense contractor with a swollen backlog. The company had a backlog of $78.7 billion last year, with orders for “defense systems” surging by 18%. This year, it expects to grow sales to $38.2 billion from $36.6 billion.Perhaps the moderating growth is why Gurufocus.com believes the stock is “modestly overvalued.” But investors should still consider that NOC has a PE ratio ranked better than 81.98% of its peers. Politicians from both sides of the aisle are also more supportive of increasing defense budgets after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Defense products are an inelastic source of revenue for these companies, and NOC is among the stocks with good potential that will weather harsh economic conditions, despite lower near-term growth.That said, I expect much higher growth in the long term. The company expects “…a greater than 20% compound annual growth in our multiyear cash flow outlook that supports continued investments in the business and significant returns of capital to shareholders.”On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).26 Companies that Donate to NonprofitsPixabay/Public domainOur MethodologyWe started off by finding as many companies as we could with nonprofit donation initiatives.

If you want to see more best US stocks for foreigners, go directly to 5 Best US Stocks for Foreigners.Given the United States has the largest economy in the world, many foreigners invest in American stocks. Furthermore, many leading American companies are multinational, giving further geographic exposure and scale.The United States is also the home to the Federal Reserve, which is the world's leading central bank. Furthermore, it is home to Wall Street, which is the world's leading financial center.Although it is already one of the most developed countries in the world, the United States has a lot of growth potential in the future.For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.The United States has substantial population growth potential.The United States leads in AI which could help produce many innovative breakthroughs that increase domestic and potentially world GDP.Many multinational American companies also have substantial emerging market operations that could help with earnings growth in the future.Many leading American blue chips also pay a dividend and also buy back stock when they have excess capital.Near Term HeadwindsThe American economy is slowing currently.Recently, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank by assets in the country, failed in a few days given the bank failed to successfully raise enough equity that it needed and customers withdrew substantial deposits.Fearing contagion, the U.S. government stepped in to protect deposits at Silicon Valley Bank.CNBC said, ""Banking regulators devised a plan Sunday to backstop depositors with money at Silicon Valley Bank, a critical step in stemming a feared systemic panic brought on by the collapse of the tech-focused institution.""Although the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank are protected, the equity shareholders of the bank aren't and the failure worsened confidence in other banks, which could have ripple effects on U.S. economic growth.Story continuesWith the failure and the higher interest rates, there is potential for the U.S. economy to slow even further and as a result, the near term is pretty uncertain in the United States. Furthermore, if the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of stocks purchased in U.S. dollars could decrease, all else equal.Despite the near term headwinds which could lead to lower stock prices if economic data fails to meet expectations, the long term potential growth of leading blue chips in the United States is still pretty attractive. The United States has the world's leading economy, leads the world in innovation currently, and will likely remain the world's innovation leader in the future. With more innovation, there could be more total value created and many of today's leading blue chips in America could benefit as a result.For those of you interested check out 12 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy.Given individual companies can fail as Silicon Valley Bank showed and sectors can also underperform, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real Estate, InvestmentPhoto by Frans Ruiter on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners, we picked 15 stocks with competitive advantages that have headquarters in the United States and that are listed in either the NYSE or the NASDAQ.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners15. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is one of the biggest asset managers in the world that has a lot of scale and competitive advantages.

Full year diluted EPS decreased 13% year over year as adjusted. While the near term could be uncertain this year, BlackRock, Inc.

Of the 943 hedge funds in our database, 49 owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q4.14. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the leading home improvement retailers in the world. While the company's customer base has been fairly resilient for most of fiscal 2022 with less price sensitivity than what would normally be expected given the persistent inflation, the company's fourth quarter 2022 comparables were slightly softer than anticipated. Given the rising interest rates and the potential for an economic slowdown, the company expects weaker demand in the near term as well. In February, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) said it saw FY23 revenue flat, and FY23 EPS down mid-single digits percentage range. Nevertheless, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has growth potential in the long term given the rising equity value of the total homes in the United States.13. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the leading discount retailers in the world with substantial scale.

While the company thinks there could be a 'slight decline' in the home improvement market in 2023, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) believes the long term outlook for the home improvement market is still strong given aging homes and the rising value of total homes.11. NIKE, Inc.

Nevertheless, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) benefits from China opening up and the company said in January it expects to pay around $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of shares in fiscal 2023. In the long term, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is still attractive given its strong brands and potential earnings power if inflation eventually normalizes.9. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks #9 on our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners given 74 hedge funds in our database owned shares of the leading investment bank at the end of Q4. Given the company's headwinds in the consumer sector, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) has narrowed its ambitions in consumer strategy and it is in the process of ceasing to offer new loans on the Marcus platform according to the company in January 2023. Going forward, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) hopes to grow its wealth and asset management business which generated $8.8 billion in management and other fees in 2022 and is expected to generate over $10 billion in management and other fees in 2024.8.

NKE is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 21. The leading sports apparel retailer is likely to have witnessed top-line growth in the fiscal third quarter, while its earnings per share are expected to have declined year over year.The company has been gaining from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with strong demand, compelling products, and robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses. Supply-chain constraints, continued weakness in Greater China and higher costs have been weighing on its performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $11.4 billion, suggesting 4.6% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at 51 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 41.4% from the year-ago reported number. Earnings estimates for the fiscal third quarter have moved up by a penny in the past seven days.We expect the company’s fiscal third-quarter total revenues to increase 1.1% year over year to $10,989.8 million and the bottom line to decline 51.1% to 43 cents per share.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 30.8%.

Price and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NIKE, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNIKE is expected to have witnessed continued strong demand for its products, robust performances in its digital and DTC businesses, and its product innovation pipeline in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Gains from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy are expected to have been other tailwinds. Continued strength in retail traffic trends within NIKE Direct has been boosting conversion rates. The strong member buying trends are likely to have resulted in record digital results in the to-be-reported quarter.The NIKE Direct business has been benefiting from robust growth across regions and an efficient digital ecosystem, which comprises its online site, as well as commercial and activity apps. Revenues at NIKE-owned stores are expected to have gained from improved traffic, higher conversion rates and growth in average order value. The NIKE Direct business is likely to have benefited from growth in North America, EMEA and APLA, offset by continued weakness in Greater China in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect total NIKE Brand revenues to increase 1.1% year over year to $10,440.9 million in the fiscal third quarter, suggesting a 2.8% decline in Direct-to-Consumer and a 4.7% rise in the Wholesale business.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue growth to be higher than the fourth quarter due to the timing of wholesale shipments.However, NKE has been witnessing a decline in the gross and operating margins due to rising costs, higher markdowns and adverse currency effects.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management provided a bleak view for third-quarter fiscal 2023, driven by expectations of higher markdowns, a higher off-price mix to liquidate elevated inventory, headwinds related to elevated freight and logistic costs, and unfavorable currency impacts. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, we expect the gross margin to decline 300 bps year over year to 43.6%. Management predicted the third-quarter fiscal 2023 gross margin to decline at a similar rate to the second quarter of fiscal 2023.NIKE has been reporting elevated SG&amp;A expenses, driven by increased demand creation expenses due to the normalization of sporting activities and overhead costs related to higher wages. Demand-creation expenses are likely to have increased in the fiscal third quarter, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments. Operating overhead expenses are expected to have resulted from higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected fiscal third-quarter SG&amp;A expenses to be in line with the fiscal second quarter. Our model estimates SG&amp;A expenses of $4,126.3 million, indicating a 20% year-over-year increase.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for NIKE this time around.

169,4d2adbe4-fded-3654-992c-9efa57cffd30,ANSS,2023-03-17,"Is ANSYS, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ANSS) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ansys-inc-nasdaq-anss-recent-124612616.html,1678970772,STORY,['ANSS'],"[ANSYS' (NASDAQ:ANSS) stock is up by a considerable 27% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ANSYS'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for ANSYS How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ANSYS is:11% = US$524m ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of ANSYS' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, ANSYS seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. This probably goes some way in explaining ANSYS' moderate 8.8% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.We then compared ANSYS' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 21% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ANSYS fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is ANSYS Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?ANSYS doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that ANSYS' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Corporation (VFC) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-v-f-corporation-130001862.html,1678971601,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. (VFC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland have returned -23.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.9% change. The Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, to which V.F. belongs, has lost 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, V.F. is expected to post earnings of $0.14 per share, indicating a change of -68.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.20 indicates a change of +5.5% from what V.F. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, V.F. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For V.F. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -2.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.62 billion and $12.04 billion estimates indicate -1.9% and +3.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryV.F. reported revenues of $3.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.6%. EPS of $1.12 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.14%. The EPS surprise was +13.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.V.F. is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about V.F. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But what does Switzerland's second-largest bank's turmoil mean for Americans? And how does Credit Suisse's sudden stumble compare to Silicon Valley Bank's collapse? Yahoo Finance Live’s Julie Hyman breaks it all down for us.When comparing Credit Suisse and SVB, it's very much apples and oranges. Credit Suisse is much larger with assets of $575 billion, compared to SVB's $200 billion. Deposit growth of the two institutions differs as well. Silicon Valley Bank enjoyed surges in deposits from cash-flooded tech start-ups, who rapidly withdrew cash once funding dried up. Comparatively, Credit Suisse enjoyed steady deposits before a more dramatic drop-off.The ""key differentiator,"" Julie says, is ""where their business lies."" Credit Suisse is big in Wealth Management and Investment Banking, while SVB was primarily Commercial Banking with core constituents: venture capital and startups. SVB was concentrated in the tech industry, and thus not seen as a systemic risk. But Credit Suisse has a much bigger influence, because of something called counterparty risk.As Julie explains, ""there's always two sides to a trade. And counterparty risk has to do with the idea, the potential that the other party... may not fulfill its part of the deal."" Since banks do business with each other and, ""Credit Suisse is one of those banks that is seen as systemically important on a global basis,"" Julie says, its failure would be far worse for the global economy.The fear that they may default on obligations also prompted a spike in Credit Suisse's credit default swaps. ""That's effectively insurance against a default,"" Julie says, citing reporting ""that some of the people buying these credit default swaps... were Credit Suisse's counterparties."" But there's good news. The Swiss national bank's liquidity lifeline makes it much less likely that Credit Suisse would default.Story continuesKey Video Moments:00:00:40 -- SVB vs. CS Assets00:01:47 -- Differences of bank business00:02:46 -- Counterparty risk, defined00:03:34 -- Credit Suisse's default swapsVideo Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JULIE HYMAN: Shares of Zurich-based Credit Suisse are recovering from its biggest one-day loss, after securing a loan from the Swiss Central Bank. Although, it's thousands of miles from the US Credit Suisse's woes could spell trouble for American markets or at least that was the concern.Let's take a closer look at why that is. And I think it's helpful to put it in perspective versus what we saw from Silicon Valley Bank and the concerns around that, as well as Signature Bank and now some of the other regional banks, right? So to sort of compare and contrast a bit. And why these are two different stories and two different areas of concern.First, you have to talk about the size of these various institutions, right? Credit Suisse's most recent reporting had assets of about $575 billion or so. And of course, it reports in Swiss francs. We've converted them for convenience here. Around $200 billion was the latest assets for SVB prior to its collapse.If you look at deposit growth from these two companies, because both are deposit taking institutions, SVB had about $173 billion in its most recent report. That was a downtick. But before that, you saw a surge in deposits, which was part of the issue, right?A huge surge in deposits from Silicon Valley, from VCs, from tech startups that then started to withdraw that money as they needed it, as they were feeling various economic duress and duress from higher interest rates. In contrast, if you look at Credit Suisse, which as we've talked about, has had issues for years. It really had steady deposits until a more dramatic drop off in its latest reporting period.So we look at those in terms of size and then we also have to talk about them in terms of where their business lies. And this is really the key differentiator. Credit Suisse's two biggest pieces of its business are in wealth management and in investment banking. Investment banking, everything from trading to advising on mergers and acquisitions.On the flip side, SVB, it's main business, 84% of its business was commercial banking. That means deposit taking and lending with its core constituents. We're talking about, again, venture capital and startup.So really very different businesses for these two different banks, which brings me to why Credit Suisse is of concern to the international banking system. Silicon Valley's concerns much more concentrated in the tech industry, right? And not seen as a systemic risk, necessarily, to the US banking system, even if it could cause some economic risks when those businesses that rely on it, for instance were afraid they couldn't make payroll.Credit Suisse's risk has to do with something called counterparty risk. That is, who's on the other side of a trade? There's always two sides to a trade, right?And so counterparty risk has to do with the idea the potential that the other party in any kind of investment or trading transaction may not fulfill its part of the deal, could default on its contractual obligations. In other words, if I have made an agreement with Credit Suisse to sell it something, to buy something from it, if it has a liquidity issue, am I going to receive my money?So that's where the concern come. Banks do business with each other, of course, internationally. Credit Suisse is one of those banks that is seen as systemically important on a global basis. So the idea that there was a potential that it could default on or not fulfill its obligations is the reason why we saw a spike in its so-called credit default swaps.Remember, we've talked about the definition for that. That's effectively insurance against a default. And various reporting out there has been that some of the people buying these credit default swaps, the insurance, were Credit Suisse's counterparties. In other words, they were insuring against the potential that Credit Suisse would indeed default.The idea that the Swiss National Bank has now come in and offered this liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse makes it less likely, much less likely that it would default and that there was the perception of default. So those prices on those CDSes should come back down. So hopefully, I've put this in perspective, Brad, in terms of how people should be thinking about these two institutions and why there's concern about each of them.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely, well broken down. And yes, you have put it in perspective extremely well, for those of us who are still getting up to speed, honestly, because I'm still on Austin, Texas--JULIE HYMAN: Because they were in Austin, Texas?BRAD SMITH: Yeah.

""The banks would come together and basically share funds and bail out the problem company. The big event in 1907, which ultimately gave rise to the Federal Reserve, is when JP Morgan supposedly got all the bankers in his house, locked the doors, and said you can't leave until you solve this banking crisis. And they solved it.""He added: ""And then in more recent times, when that mutual fund went down [in 2008], the same thing happened. Everybody got together, put money in, except for Bear Stearns, which refused to do so. And so we're seeing it happen again. And it works.""People are seen inside the First Republic Bank branch in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., March 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mike SegarTo be sure, the past week has been one for the history books in the banking space.Late Wednesday, Credit Suisse (CS) said it would tap about $54 billion from Swiss regulators as its own internal crisis spread to public markets.And just one week ago, Silicon Valley Bank's collapse marked the second-largest bank failure in the U.S., behind only Washington Mutual during the Great Recession. Signature Bank's (SBNY) demise was the third-largest bank failure in history.Story continuesThe turbulent situation caused regulators to spring into action to prevent a banking crisis and mass tech layoffs, which is what likely would have happened if left unaddressed.The collective moves worldwide have stabilized broader equity and bond markets. But not everyone is ready to give an all-clear sign similar to Bove.""We shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves, and it’s worth remembering that we’ve already had a temporary period of stability on Tuesday that was then dented by the Credit Suisse worries on Wednesday,"" pointed out Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a note on Friday.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Other secondary endpoints are being analyzed. No new safety signals have been observed to date in the preliminary safety analysis, which is consistent with the established safety profile of XTANDI.""As the only novel hormone therapy approved for three disease states of prostate cancer in the U.S., XTANDI has impacted hundreds of thousands of men,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""The topline findings from EMBARK are highly encouraging and we look forward to engaging with health authorities to potentially bring XTANDI to men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence.""Story continues""While current treatment options for localized prostate cancer are intended to be curative, some men remain at higher risk for biochemical recurrence following primary treatment, which may result in metastases,"" said Ahsan Arozullah, M.D., MPH, Senior Vice President and Head of Development Therapeutic Areas, Astellas. ""The EMBARK trial is the first study to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in MFS using the combination of XTANDI plus leuprolide in men with this stage of disease.""Detailed results from EMBARK will be presented at a future medical meeting. These data will also be discussed with regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to support a potential regulatory submission for XTANDI in this indication.About EMBARKThe Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial enrolled 1,068 patients with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC; also known as non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or nmCSPC) with high-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR) at sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients who were considered high-risk BCR had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time ≤ 9 months, serum testosterone ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L), and screening PSA by the central laboratory ≥ 1 ng/mL if they had a radical prostatectomy (with or without radiotherapy) as primary treatment for prostate cancer or at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir if they had radiotherapy only as primary treatment for prostate cancer. Patients in the EMBARK trial were randomized to receive enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus leuprolide, enzalutamide 160 mg as a monotherapy, or placebo plus leuprolide.The primary endpoint of the trial was metastasis-free survival (MFS) for enzalutamide plus leuprolide and placebo plus leuprolide. MFS is defined as the duration of time in months between randomization and the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression by central imaging or death. For more information on the EMBARK (NCT02319837) trial go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.XTANDI has not been approved for the treatment of patients with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR.About Non-Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer with High-Risk Biochemical Recurrence  Non-metastatic hormone- (or castration-) sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC or nmCSPC) means there is no detectable evidence of the cancer spreading to distant parts of the body (metastases) with conventional radiological methods (CT/MRI) and the cancer still responds to medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone levels.1,2 Of men who have undergone definitive prostate cancer treatment, including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or both, an estimated 20-40% will experience a biochemical recurrence (BCR) within 10 years.3 About 9 out of 10 men with high-risk BCR will develop metastatic disease, and 1 in 3 will die as a result of the recurrence.3 The EMBARK trial focused on men with high-risk BCR. Per the EMBARK protocol, patients with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR are those initially treated by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, or both, with a PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months. High-risk BCR patients with a PSA doubling time of ≤ 9 months have a higher risk of metastases and death.4About XTANDI® (enzalutamide)XTANDI (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. The recommended dosage of XTANDI is 160 mg (capsules or tablets) administered orally once daily with or without food. XTANDI is a standard of care that has received regulatory approvals for use in men with mHSPC, mCRPC, and nmCRPC in the United States and for one or more of these indications in more than 100 countries, including the European Union and Japan. More than 720,000 patients have been treated with XTANDI globally.5E.U. Important Safety InformationEnzalutamide is indicated in the European Union for the treatment of adult men with:1.  Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).2.  High-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).3.  Metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of ADT in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. It is also indicated in adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.For Important Safety Information for enzalutamide please see the full Summary of Product Characteristics at: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/overview/xtandi-epar-medicine-overview_en.pdf.U.S. Important Safety InformationXTANDI (enzalutamide) is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).Warnings and Precautions Seizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. In a study of patients with predisposing factors for seizure, 2.2% of XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following predisposing factors: use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, history of traumatic brain or head injury, history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, and Alzheimer's disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, history of seizure, presence of a space-occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while taking XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving XTANDI. PRES is a neurological disorder that can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES.Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions.Ischemic Heart Disease In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.9% vs 1.3%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.4% of patients on XTANDI versus 0.7% on placebo. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on XTANDI compared to 0.1% on placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease.Falls and Fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In the combined data of four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 11% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo. Fractures occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI.Adverse Reactions (ARs) In the data from the four randomized placebo-controlled trials, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, hot flush, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and hypertension. In the bicalutamide-controlled study, the most common ARs (≥ 10%) reported in XTANDI-treated patients were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, hypertension, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight loss.In AFFIRM, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients who previously received docetaxel, Grade 3 and higher ARs were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. In PREVAIL, the placebo-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 44% of XTANDI patients and 37% of placebo patients. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported for 6% of XTANDI treated patients. In TERRAIN, the bicalutamide-controlled study of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients, Grade 3-4 ARs were reported in 39% of XTANDI patients and 38% of bicalutamide patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 8% of XTANDI patients and 6% of bicalutamide patients.In PROSPER, the placebo-controlled study of non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher ARs were reported in 31% of XTANDI patients and 23% of placebo patients. Discontinuations with an AE as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI patients and 6% of placebo patients.In ARCHES, the placebo-controlled study of metastatic CSPC (mCSPC) patients, Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 24% of XTANDI-treated patients. Permanent discontinuation due to AEs as the primary reason was reported in 5% of XTANDI patients and 4% of placebo patients.Lab Abnormalities: Lab abnormalities that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients, and more frequently (&gt; 2%) in the XTANDI arm compared to placebo in the pooled, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell decreased, hyperglycemia, hypermagnesemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia.Hypertension: In the combined data from four randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, hypertension was reported in 12% of XTANDI patients and 5% of placebo patients. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in &lt; 1% of patients in each arm.Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, as they can increase the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the dose of XTANDI. Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers as they can decrease the plasma exposure to XTANDI. If coadministration is necessary, increase the dose of XTANDI. Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Avoid CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, as XTANDI may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. If XTANDI is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), conduct additional INR monitoring.Please see Full Prescribing Information for additional safety information.About Pfizer OncologyAt Pfizer Oncology, we are committed to advancing medicines wherever we believe we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of people living with cancer.

183,5ff3c3e7-e1c1-3360-a3e4-ed6a1dc0746c,PFE,2023-03-17,COVID-19 pill Paxlovid moves closer to full FDA approval,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covid-19-pill-paxlovid-moves-203029334.html,1678998629,STORY,['PFE'],"[WASHINGTON (AP) — Pfizer’s COVID-19 pill Paxlovid won another vote of confidence from U.S. health advisers Thursday, clearing the way for its full regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration.The medication has been used by millions of Americans since the FDA granted it emergency use authorization in late 2021. The agency has the final say on giving Pfizer's drug full approval and is expected to decide by May.A panel of outside experts voted 16-1 that Paxlovid remains a safe and effective treatment for high-risk adults with COVID-19 who are more likely to face hospitalization and death due to the virus.“We still have many groups that stand to benefit from Paxlovid, including unvaccinated persons, under-vaccinated persons, the elderly and the immuno-compromised,” said Dr. Richard Murphy of the Department of Veterans Affairs.The FDA said using Paxlovid in high-risk patients could prevent 1,500 COVID-19 deaths and 13,000 hospitalizations per week.The panel's positive vote was widely expected, given that Paxlovid has been the go-to treatment against COVID-19, especially since an entire group of antibody drugs has been sidelined as the virus mutated.The U.S. continues reporting about 4,000 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations weekly, the FDA noted.The agency asked its panel of independent medical experts to address several lingering questions involving Paxlovid, including which people currently benefit from treatment and whether the drug plays a role in cases of COVID-19 rebound.The panel agreed with assessments by both the FDA and Pfizer that found no clear link between the use of Paxlovid and returning symptoms, but said more information is needed from studies and medical records data. High-profile cases drew attention to the issue last year, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden.Between 10% and 16% of patients across multiple Pfizer studies had symptoms return, regardless of whether they’d received Paxlovid or a dummy pill. Such cases “likely reflect natural COVID-19 progression,” the FDA concluded.Story continuesThe federal government has purchased more than 20 million doses of Paxlovid and encouraged health professionals to prescribe it aggressively to help prevent severe COVID-19. But that’s led to concerns of overprescribing and questions of whether some patients are needlessly getting the drug.Pfizer originally studied Paxlovid in the highest-risk COVID-19 patients: unvaccinated adults with other health problems and no evidence of prior coronavirus infection. But that doesn’t reflect the U.S. population today, where an estimated 95% of people have protection from at least one vaccine dose, a prior infection or both.The FDA reviewed Pfizer data showing Paxlovid made no meaningful difference in otherwise healthy adults, whether or not they’d been previously vaccinated.But when FDA teased out data for high-risk adults — regardless of their vaccination or infection history — Paxlovid still showed a significant benefit, reducing the chance of hospitalization or death between 60% and 85%, depending on individual circumstances. Patients in that group included seniors and those with serious health problems, such as diabetes, obesity, lung disease and immune-system disorders.With so many different factors, panelists said prescribing Paxlovid will remain a case-by-case decision.Dr. Sankar Swaminathan of the University of Utah and other panelists stressed the importance of managing potentially dangerous drug interactions between Paxlovid and other commonly used medications.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

184,73fc8a65-ab1f-3522-bd6d-d80b47e5faa8,PFE,2023-03-17,FDA Advisory Committee Votes in Support of Favorable Benefit-Risk Profile for Pfizer’s PAXLOVID™,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-advisory-committee-votes-support-191800635.html,1678994280,STORY,['PFE'],"[The target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for a decision by the FDA is May 2023NEW YORK, March 16, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC) voted 16 to 1 that available data support the safety and effectiveness of PAXLOVID™ (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult patients who are at high risk for progression to severe illness. The AMDAC's vote, while not binding, will be considered by the FDA when making its decision regarding the potential approval of PAXLOVID.""We believe it is critical for adults who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 to have access to safe and effective treatment options, like PAXLOVID, to help prevent avoidable hospitalizations and deaths,"" said James Rusnak, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine, Anti-infectives and Hospital, Pfizer. ""We are encouraged by the AMDAC’s positive vote today. The outcome is well supported by the strong safety and efficacy data seen both in our clinical trials and in a growing base of real-world evidence, showing that PAXLOVID helps to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death for high-risk adult patients regardless of vaccination status.""The AMDAC based its vote on the totality of scientific and real-world evidence shared by Pfizer, including safety and efficacy data from the EPIC (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19) clinical development program. This included results from the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR study (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients), which enrolled unvaccinated, non-hospitalized adults, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe disease. The data showed an 86% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 in patients treated with PAXLOVID within 5 days of symptoms onset, compared to placebo. The vote was further supported by results from a secondary endpoint of the Phase 2/3 EPIC-SR study (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients) which showed the effectiveness of Paxlovid in a sub-group of non-hospitalized adults, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed COVID-19 who had at least one risk factor for progression to severe disease and who were fully vaccinated.Story continuesIn addition, real-world evidence presented to the AMDAC showed that PAXLOVID’s clinical profile in the post-authorization setting is consistent with the safety and efficacy conclusions from the EPIC clinical program, including observations made when the Omicron variant and its lineages were the predominant forms of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation. This real-world evidence also shows the effectiveness of PAXLOVID among vaccinated patients and patients who developed natural immunity.1,2,3COVID-19 continues to cause significant burden in the U.S. as case rates fluctuate and new variants and sub-variants emerge, regardless of virulence. Approximately 4,000‒5,000 hospital admissions and 500‒600 deaths are caused by the virus each day in the U.S., as of January 2023.4 With more than 200 million adults in the U.S. at high risk of severe COVID-19, there is a critical need for treatment options in this population.5 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), factors which could put someone at high risk of severe COVID-19 include any of the following: being aged 50 and older, obesity, diabetes (type 1 and type 2), heart conditions, smoking (current or former), physical inactivity, chronic kidney or liver disease, and cancer, among others.6If approved by the FDA, PAXLOVID could be the first U.S. FDA-approved oral treatment for COVID-19. The target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for a decision by the FDA is May 2023. Under the FDA emergency use authorization (EUA), PAXLOVID is currently authorized for use in, and remains available to, adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. In the U.S., more than 10 million treatment courses of PAXLOVID have been prescribed to date.7Pfizer continues to gather pediatric data from the ongoing clinical trial EPIC-Peds (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Pediatric Patients) and intends to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (NDA) to support the FDA approval of PAXLOVID in children at a future date. In February 2023, the European Commission (EC) granted standard Marketing Authorization (MA) of PAXLOVID for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of the disease becoming severe.About PAXLOVID™ (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets)PAXLOVID is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor (also known as SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitor) therapy. It was developed to be administered orally so that it can be prescribed early after infection, potentially helping patients avoid severe illness (which can lead to hospitalization and death). Nirmatrelvir, which originated in Pfizer laboratories, is designed to block the activity of the Mpro, an enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate. Co-administration with a low dose of ritonavir helps slow the metabolism, or breakdown, of nirmatrelvir in order for it to remain active in the body for longer periods of time at higher concentrations to help combat the virus.Nirmatrelvir is designed to inhibit viral replication at a stage known as proteolysis, which occurs before viral RNA replication. In preclinical studies, nirmatrelvir did not demonstrate evidence of mutagenic DNA interactions.Current variants of concern can be resistant to treatments that work by binding to the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. PAXLOVID, however, works intracellularly by binding to the highly conserved Mpro (3CL protease) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inhibit viral replication. Nirmatrelvir has shown consistent in vitro antiviral activity against the variants Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, BA.4.6, BA.5, BF.7, BQ.1.11, BQ.1 and XBB.1.5. Work is ongoing to evaluate activity against recently identified variants as they become available for testing.PAXLOVID is generally administered at a standard dose of 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, taken together twice-daily for five days. One carton contains five blister packs of PAXLOVID, as co-packaged nirmatrelvir tablets with ritonavir tablets, providing all required doses for a full five-day treatment course. The dose for patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min) should be reduced to 150 mg nirmatrelvir (one 150 mg tablet) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet), with both tablets taken together twice daily for five days (PAXLOVID is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment [eGFR &lt;30 mL/min]).For more information, please visit www.PAXLOVID.com.U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization StatementPAXLOVID has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an EUA, for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.The emergency use of PAXLOVID is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.AUTHORIZED USEThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the emergency use of the unapproved product PAXLOVID for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.LIMITATIONS OF AUTHORIZED USEPAXLOVID is not authorized for initiation of treatment in patients requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19PAXLOVID is not authorized for use as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19PAXLOVID is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive daysPAXLOVID may be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs.PAXLOVID may also be prescribed for an individual patient by a state-licensed pharmacist under the following conditions:Sufficient information is available, such as through access to health records less than 12 months old or consultation with a health care provider in an established provider-patient relationship with the individual patient, to assess renal and hepatic function; andSufficient information is available, such as through access to health records, patient reporting of medical history, or consultation with a health care provider in an established provider-patient relationship with the individual patient, to obtain a comprehensive list of medications (prescribed and non-prescribed) that the patient is taking to assess for potential drug interaction.The state-licensed pharmacist should refer an individual patient for clinical evaluation (e.g., telehealth, in-person visit) with a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs, if any of the following apply:Sufficient information is not available to assess renal and hepatic function.Sufficient information is not available to assess for a potential drug interaction.Modification of other medications is needed due to a potential drug interaction.PAXLOVID is not an appropriate therapeutic option based on the authorized Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers or due to potential drug interactions for which recommended monitoring would not be feasible.PAXLOVID is not approved for any use, including for use for the treatment of COVID-19.PAXLOVID is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of PAXLOVID under 564(b)(1) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONPAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions (eg, toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN] or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product.Drugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions:Alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosinAntianginal: ranolazineAntiarrhythmic: amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidineAnti-gout: colchicineAntipsychotics: lurasidone, pimozideBenign prostatic hyperplasia agents: silodosinCardiovascular agents: eplerenone, ivabradineErgot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovineHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatinImmunosuppressants: voclosporinMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor: lomitapideMigraine medications: eletriptan, ubrogepantMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: finerenoneOpioid antagonists: naloxegolPDE5 inhibitor: sildenafil (Revatio®) when used for pulmonary arterial hypertensionSedative/hypnotics: triazolam, oral midazolamSerotonin receptor 1A agonist/serotonin receptor 2A antagonist: flibanserinVasopressin receptor antagonists: tolvaptanPAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. PAXLOVID cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medications due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer:Anticancer drugs: apalutamideAnticonvulsant: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoinCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators: lumacaftor/ivacaftorAntimycobacterials: rifampinHerbal Products: St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum)There are limited clinical data available for PAXLOVID. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with PAXLOVID use.Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions: Initiation of PAXLOVID, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID, respectively. These interactions may lead to:Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicationsClinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of PAXLOVIDLoss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistanceConsult Table 1 of the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 1 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy; review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications.Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID. Cases of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported with ritonavir, a component of PAXLOVID (refer to NORVIR prescribing information). If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.Because nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.Adverse events in the PAXLOVID group (≥1%) that occurred at a greater frequency (≥5 subject difference) than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (6% and &lt;1%, respectively), diarrhea (3% and 2%), hypertension (1% and &lt;1%), and myalgia (1% and &lt;1%). The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2% in the PAXLOVID group and 4% in the placebo group.The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-authorization use of PAXLOVID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactionsGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nauseaGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: MalaiseRequired Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication Errors: The prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to PAXLOVID within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event.Submit adverse event and medication error reports to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:Online: https://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 and returning by mail/faxCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting formIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to: www.pfizersafetyreporting.com, or by fax (1-866-635-8337) or phone (1-800-438-1985).PAXLOVID is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring.Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect.Pregnancy: There are no available human data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects. Published studies with ritonavir are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of nirmatrelvir in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A transient decrease in body weight was observed in the nursing offspring of rats administered nirmatrelvir. Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID‑19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID‑19.Contraception: Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception.Pediatrics: PAXLOVID is not authorized for use in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. The safety and effectiveness of PAXLOVID have not been established in pediatric patients. The authorized adult dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in adults, and adults with similar body weight were included in the trial EPIC-HR.Systemic exposure of nirmatrelvir increases in renally impaired patients with increase in the severity of renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min), reduce the dose of PAXLOVID to 150 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily for 5 days. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions. PAXLOVID is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min based on CKD-EPI formula) until more data are available; the appropriate dosage for patients with severe renal impairment has not been determined.No dosage adjustment of PAXLOVID is needed for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Please see Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers and Fact Sheet for Patients, Parents, and Caregivers.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Among these, Seagen SGEN was up on news of its acquisition by Pfizer.  New drug approvals were also in the spotlight.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Acadia’s Drug Approval:  Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. ACAD announced that the FDA has approved trofinetide, under the brand name Daybue, for treating Rett syndrome in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older.  The FDA approval was supported by results from the phase III LAVENDER study which evaluated the efficacy and safety of trofinetide versus placebo in 187 female patients with Rett syndrome five to 20 years of age. Data showed treatment with Daybue demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo on both co-primary efficacy endpoints, as measured by the change from baseline in Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ) total score (p=0.018) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale score (p=0.003) at week 12.  Along with the FDA approval, Acadia has received a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, which can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent application.Acadia currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.GSK’s Vaccine Data: GSK plc GSK announced positive data from a phase III study for its MenABCWY combination vaccine candidate, administered as two doses six months apart in healthy individuals aged 10-25 years.  The phase III randomized, controlled, observer-blind, multi-country study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of GSK’s MenABCWY vaccine candidate. MenABCWY vaccine candidate combines the antigenic components of its licensed meningococcal vaccines, Bexsero (MenB) and Menveo (MenACWY).The study met all its primary endpoints, including the non-inferiority of the vaccine candidate for all five Neisseria meningitides serogroups (A, B, C, W, and Y) compared to licensed meningococcal vaccines Bexsero and Menveo in terms of an immune response. Per GSK, a potential approval of this 5-in-1 vaccine candidate could provide the broadest meningococcal serogroup coverage and lead to a simplified immunization schedule.Story continuesSetback for Mersana: Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical Mersana Therapeutics, Inc. MRSN announced that the phase I study of XMT-2056 has been placed on clinical hold by the FDA. Mersana voluntarily suspended the trial due to a recent Grade 5 (fatal) serious adverse event (SAE) that was deemed related to XMT-2056 and informed the FDA about the same. XMT-2056 is Mersana’s first Immunosynthen STING-agonist ADC product candidate to enter the clinic. The SAE was observed in the second patient enrolled at the initial dose level in the dose escalation portion of the phase I study in previously treated patients with HER2+ recurrent or metastatic solid tumors.Aridis Meets Study Goals: Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ARDS announced positive preliminary top-line results from the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase IIa study of AR-501. The study evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three ascending doses of AR-501 administered as an inhaled aerosol in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with confirmed pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial and other potential infections.  AR-501 is being developed as a once-per-week inhaled dosing regimen that is self-administered using a commercially available nebulizer device.The study’s primary and secondary endpoints of safety and PK were met.The study achieved high uptake of AR-501 in the respiratory tract at levels that were more than 50-fold higher than required for inhibition of the target bacteria P. aeruginosa.Seagen to be Acquired by Pfizer:  Shares of Seagen, Inc. (SGEN) surged after pharma giant Pfizer announced that it will acquire the former for $229 in cash per share for a total enterprise value of $43 billion. The news was mostly expected as last month there were reports of the same. Seagen’s portfolio includes four approved drugs, including three ADCs: Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), Padcev (enfortumab vedotin), and Tivdak (tisotumab vedotin). The company also commercializes Tuksya (tucatinib).Seagen expects to generate approximately $2.2 billion of revenues in 2023, up 12% year over year, with growth from its four in-line medicines, royalties and collaboration and license agreements. Pfizer believes Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues in 2030, with significant potential for growth beyond 2030.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has lost 0.10% in the past five trading sessions.

Cultural touchstone movies brought to life there include ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""The Sound of Music.""Fox Corp., which retained ownership of the lot when Walt Disney Co. bought most of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets in 2019, submitted an amended plan to Los Angeles building officials Wednesday calling for the addition of office towers, soundstages and other facilities used to make television shows and movies.The investment reflects the nearly nonstop demand for stages that has emerged in the streaming television age and Fox's desire to further profit from one of its most cherished assets. Fox's plans include a high-rise more than 30 stories tall on Avenue of the Stars that could be rented to tenants looking for fancy digs in Century City's thriving office market.""Our vision is to secure the future of the lot by investing in production infrastructure and the Century City business core,"" said Gary Ehrlich, president and general manager of Fox Studio Lot.A view of the exterior wall of Stage 10 at the Fox Studio covered with a mural depicting a scene from 1955 comedy ""The Seven Year Itch."" (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)The moneymaking potential of the busy 53-acre studio lot on Pico Boulevard was clear when the Murdochs carved it out of the $71.3-billion deal with Disney that put Captain America and Wolverine on the same team four years ago and led to the creation of Fox Corp.Lachlan Murdoch, the elder son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, runs Fox Corp. as its chief executive and keeps an office on the Fox lot once occupied by illustrious studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck. Rupert Murdoch is chairman of the company.“The Fox Studio Lot is one of the most iconic and treasured production locations in the history of entertainment and is a rich part of our history,” Lachlan Murdoch said in a statement. The proposed expansion project, he said, ""represents a long-term commitment to our industry, to our community, and to the City of Los Angeles.” Story continuesFox Corp. is made up of former 21st Century Fox assets that were not included in the Disney deal including the studio property, Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Entertainment and Fox Television Stations.Disney is the lot’s primary tenant, occupying office and production space. Among the shows it produces there are two of Fox’s most popular series: “9-1-1” and “9-1-1: Lone Star.” Sports programs such as ""Fox NFL Sunday,"" ""MLB on Fox"" and ""The Herd With Colin Cowherd"" are based there.The lot also remains the home of the writers room for “The Simpsons,” which has aired on Fox for more than 30 years.Although new office high-rises have been rare in Los Angeles in recent decades, rental activity suggests there could be demand for another big building in Century City that would rise next to a shuttered hotel south of the 2121 Avenue of the Stars office tower. That red-granite and glass building was formerly called Fox Plaza but may be better known to movie fans as fictional Nakatomi Plaza, where Bruce Willis fought terrorists in ""Die Hard.""At a time when most office centers including downtown Los Angeles are experiencing a slowdown in leasing caused in part by companies' shifts to remote work and fears of a slowing economy, the Century City neighborhood stands out as a robust market commanding some of the highest rents in the region.""It's probably the strongest office market in Southern California,"" said property broker Carl Muhlstein of JLL, who specializes in entertainment real estate deals.Only 8.5% of offices in Century City are unleased — compared with 19.4% countywide — according to brokerage CBRE, and landlords there ask for rents 50% above the county average.There are few locations left in the neighborhood to build big office buildings. Last year one of Hollywood's leading talent agencies, Creative Artists Agency, agreed to become the anchor tenant in a 37-story tower being built on Avenue of the Stars, where construction activity is still mostly underground. Other businesses have agreed to move in when it opens in 2026.""The CAA tower hasn't even risen above sea level,"" Muhlstein said, ""and it's already 50% leased.""Upgrades on the Fox lot would add nine soundstages, bringing the number of stages to 24. The additional stages would be equipped with the latest technologies for modern film, television and content creation, Fox said.Also planned is an office building more than 20 stories tall that would be designed specifically for people working for companies based on the lot. It would rise along Olympic Boulevard west of Avenue of the Stars.The Fox lot today holds a hodgepodge of old and new buildings built for both administration and production services, including four scoring and mixing stages, two broadcast studios, theaters, editing bays and other production facilities. It has 96 buildings with a combined total of 1.8 million square feet. The planned development would add 1.6 million square feet.Fox's announced expansion comes on the heels of another huge proposed makeover revealed last month by the owners of Radford Studio Center in Studio City. Hackman Capital Partners said it plans to spend $1 billion to upgrade the former CBS Studio Center with as much as 1 million square feet of new soundstages, production facilities and offices.The rise of streaming has escalated demand for soundstages and other production facilities and prompted the development of new studios around the Los Angeles region.Existing soundstages in Los Angeles County have been almost fully rented for years, which can make it hard for new productions to find places to work, according to FilmLA, the nonprofit that handles film permits in the region.""There's just this unmitigated demand for not only stages but all the production support that goes with mounting productions at a particular location,"" Ehrlich said.Studios are operating near 100% capacity with wait lists as long as five film productions deep for those spaces, financial advisor Deloitte said in a 2021 report.“To meet the booming demand, supply would need to more than double in Los Angeles County” in the next few years, Deloitte said. Planned projects for more studio space fall far short of that.Fox Studios traces its lineage to co-founder William Fox’s 1924 purchase of 99 acres between Santa Monica and Pico boulevards from Janss Investment Co., the developers of Westwood Village. Fox Films merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935, forming 20th Century Fox.The lot grew to as large as 285 acres at its height but eventually shrank to its current size as the studio was hit with a string of flops, including the Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor vehicle “Cleopatra,” whose budget had ballooned before its 1963 release. Desperate for cash, studio bosses sold nearly 180 acres in 1961 to businessman William Zeckendorf and Aluminum Co. of America for the development of Century City.The city approval process for the latest proposed changes to the studio could be lengthy, Ehrlich said, but Fox hopes to get underway on new development in the next few years.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

These stocks play a critical role in the proliferation of blockchain, a technology that will continue to be strong. According to the research firm, MarketsandMarkets, the blockchain industry could grow by a whopping 66.2% to reach $94 billion by 2027. With the crypto market expected to shine over the long term, it’s probably the right time to load up on the sector.However, it is imperative to understand the risks involved in investing in the space. Anything crypto-related is heavily linked to the actions of the Federal Reserve. With the Fed looking to curb inflationary pressures at all costs, the sector will continue to struggle in the interim.

Its chips have a wide variety of use cases for multiple industries, including blockchain with its application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips.ASIC chips are specifically designed for use in crypto mining, providing the computation power to mine cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD). Moreover, some of the biggest crypto miners in Bitmain source hardware from TSM. As we advance, TSM’s multi-billion dollar investments in the space will continue to grow its market share. Moreover, according to DataIntelo, the global ASIC market will likely grow at a CAGR of 18.6% through 2030. Therefore, there’s plenty of upside potential ahead for TSM, especially once the crypto markets snap back in the not-so-distant future.Story continuesBlockchain Stocks: PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was the first fintech giant that forayed into the crypto sector. It greenlit Bitcoin transactions back in 2014 and since then has significantly increased its stake in the industry.The platform now allows users to buy, sell, and hold cryptos with PayPal, with customers using its Checkout with Crypto service. Moreover, users can also move their coins to other exchanges and hold other cryptos apart from BTC, including Litecoin (LTC-USD) and Ethereum. At the end of 2022, PayPal held a whopping $604 million in crypto holdings. Naturally, with the broad-based market correction, the value of its crypto holdings has plummeted but is poised for a massive upside ahead.Moreover, PayPal operates a robust core business that continues to wow investors despite the market headwinds. It rounded off the year with another strong performance during its fourth quarter, with a massive increase in payment volumes and net new active accounts. Moreover, the icing on the cake was its vigorous fiscal 2023 guidance.Blockchain Stocks: Riot Blockchain (RIOT)An image of a miner with a pickaxe mining digital coins, computer code and various numbers are overlaid on the imageSource: Yev_1234 / ShutterstockShares of Bitcoin-miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) are up 56% year-to-date, fueling its comeback story. Bitcoin has also been trending higher this year, gaining over 30% since the start of the year. Additionally, with a relatively weak dollar and the Bitcoin halving event next year, RIOT stock could gain immensely in the upcoming months.During the pandemic years, Riot was posting triple and even quadruple-digit revenue growth rates pushing its stock price to record highs. However, amidst a never-ending crypto winter, growth rates have normalized, and then some. Nonetheless, the firm reported $255 million in cash in its most recent quarter with zero debt. If its recovery sustains, the firm could further grow its capacity.Its mining capacity increased by a tremendous 213% from the prior-year period to 9.7EH/S, and further expansion will lead to a swelling of digital assets and value creation. The firm already has plans to increase its capacity to 12.5EH/s by the first half of 2023.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

Big Blue was slow to embrace the rapid changes in the sphere, with its peers investing in new and more profitable tech verticals in blockchain, cloud computing, consulting, and others. However, all that has changed as hardware-giant IBM now boasts an equally potent, if not more, software suite.Particularly, with crypto, its strategy revolves around developing a wide range of blockchain solutions. This includes its cloud-based platform, IBM Blockchain, enabling clients to deploy blockchain applications effectively. The platform empowers businesses to digitize transactions effectively through a secured and distributed ledger, significantly boosting efficiency. Also, it offers services and expertise in multiple areas, including smart contracts, crypto wallets, and promoting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).IBM’s software strength continues to improve each quarter, helping offset losses from hardware. Its consulting and cloud businesses (including blockchain) have grown by double-digit margins over the past several quarters.Mastercard (MA)Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.comMastercard (NYSE:MA) was recently named among the 22 financial businesses that made Forbes’ 2023 Blockchain 50 list. The list covers the top billion-dollar companies putting distributed-ledger technology to effective use in the real world. The company’s crypto strategy focuses on integrating blockchain and digital technologies into its robust payment infrastructure. Moreover, it aims to develop new products and services and partner with various exchanges to effectively enable its customers to spend their digital currencies with millions of merchants worldwide.However, after the FTX and BlockFi debacle, Mastercard is looking to slam the breaks of forging new partnerships. Nevertheless, a company spokesperson states, “Our efforts continue to focus on the underlying blockchain technology and how that can be applied to help address current pain points and build more efficient systems.”Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was in the news for all the wrong reasons last summer. The US SEC called out the tech giant for not properly informing its investors about how crypto miners were driving GPU demand. The company eventually had to pay the US SEC $5.5 million in settlement fees, with many investors questioning whether its move into crypto was wise.During the industry’s boom, Nvidia generated a ton of money from sales to crypto miners. Consequently, it released new cards intended for crypto-mining purposes called cryptocurrency mining processors (CMPs). However, CMP sales have dropped emphatically in recent quarters. For the fourth quarter ending, Nvidia saw a 77% drop in CMP sales from the previous quarter. Nvidia has come out of its regulatory troubles relatively unscathed and can continue investing in its CMP divisions for the foreseeable future. Its businesses continue to fire on all cylinders, and its recent exploits in AI point to an even brighter outlook for the company.HIVE Blockchain (HIVE)HIVE Blockchain Technologies logo over a map of the world. HIVE stock.Source: karnoff / ShutterstockWith BTC’s relatively heartening performance of late, it’s perhaps the best time to pick up some stocks on the comeback trail. Another Bitcoin miner poised for robust gains ahead could be HIVE Blockchain (NASDAQ:HIVE), which languishes in the penny stock territory now. In fact, after plunging over 60% in the last 12 months, HIVE stock appears to be deeply undervalued.In its most recent quarter, the company reported several positives despite a precipitous drop in sales. It effectively mined 787 BTC during the quarter, translating into a 13% gain from last year.  The firm’s mining capacity is at 3.33EH/s as of last month, a 36.7% increase as of September. If the rally in BTC persists, we could see considerable expansion in Hive’s margins in the upcoming quarters.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

The partnership continues to generate stable cash flows by distributing more than 10 fuel brands under its long-term distribution contracts, with about 10,000 convenience stores.Higher fuel consumption and refining production in the domestic market will likely drive the demand for wholesale fuel distribution businesses. Sunoco is expected to benefit from recovering gasoline demand and rising diesel fuel consumption. This will boost the partnership’s profits.In 2022, Sunoco generated adjusted EBITDA of $919 million, which increased 22% from $754 million reported a year ago. Also, Sunoco expects adjusted EBITDA of $850-$900 million for 2023. The partnership is also focusing on reducing costs and expenses, which are expected to benefit its bottom line.Moreover, Sunoco expects year-over-year continuous volume improvements. For 2023, Sunoco expects fuel volumes of 7.8 billion gallons, indicating an increase from the 7.7 billion gallons reported in 2022.

He added that Barra discussed with the lawmakers ""the future of mobility -- including autonomous vehicles.""GM and its self-driving technology unit, Cruise, in February 2022 disclosed that they had petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for permission to deploy up to 2,500 self-driving vehicles annually without steering wheels, mirrors, turn signals or windshield wipers.GM wants to deploy its Origin vehicle, which has subway-like doors and no steering wheels. GM says vehicles will require passengers to buckle seat belts prior to autonomous rides. The NHTSA opened the petition for public comment in July but has not acted on it.In 2017, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote legislation to speed the adoption of self-driving cars, bar states from setting performance standards and expand the number of vehicles that could be deployed with exemptions, but the bill never passed the U.S. Senate.Cruise in 2021 urged President Joe Biden to back self-driving car legislation, saying the country risked lagging behind China.In December, the NHTSA opened a safety probe into the autonomous driving system in vehicles produced by Cruise after reports of two injuries in rear-end crashes. NHTSA said it received notices of incidents in which self-driving Cruise vehicles ""may engage in inappropriately hard braking or become immobilized.""Cruise said in December it was cooperating in the investigation, noting it had ""driven nearly 700,000 fully autonomous miles in an extremely complex urban environment with zero life-threatening injuries or fatalities.""

201,834ed99d-0670-312c-8a0d-d18fc264f053,GM,2023-03-17,3 Domestic Auto Stocks Well-Poised to Fend Off Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-domestic-auto-stocks-well-132101635.html,1678972861,STORY,"['PCAR', '^GSPC', 'HOG', 'GM']","[The prospects of the Zacks Domestic Auto industry look somewhat shaky at the moment amid rising recessionary fears, which may cool off demand for vehicles. A brewing banking crisis is adding fuel to the already weak economy mired by stubborn inflation and Fed’s hawkish stance. Many economists project that the United States could slip into recession sooner than expected. With consumers rather downbeat about economic outlook, they are less likely to spend heavily on high-ticket items, which may hurt vehicle sales. Additionally, high commodity and labor costs are adversely impacting the margins of the industry participants. While robust deliveries of electric vehicles (EV) are acting as a booster, the overall prospects of the industry don’t appear bright, at least for the near term.Nonetheless, we recommend keeping a close eye on three auto giants namely General Motors GM, PACCAR PCAR and Harley-Davidson HOG, which are better positioned to brave the multiple industry challenges.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.What's Shaping the Industry?Intensified Economic Uncertainty: At a time when the U.S. economy is already mired in uncertainty amid Fed’s aggressive rate hikes, the sudden collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank has just added to the gloom. The banking crisis has prompted Goldman Sachs to ratchet down U.S. GDP forecasts. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs lowered its U.S. growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 1.2% for 2023. The investment banking giant also raised the probability of a U.S. recession from 25% to 35%. The highly cyclical Domestic Auto industry is likely to feel the heat of a fragile economy. Demand for vehicles is expected to cool off as consumers are gradually becoming apprehensive about buying high-ticket items when recessionary fears are growing. While auto sales in 2022 fell to a decade low, primarily owing to supply chain issues, this year, the industry is likely to suffer from macroeconomic challenges. The supply crunch is most likely to morph into a demand slowdown in 2023.Story continuesHigh Commodity &amp; Operational Costs: Prices of raw materials like steel, aluminum and others are soaring and adversely impacting the gross margins. Commodity inflation, although gradually abating, is far from over. Most automakers have already warned that high raw materials and labor costs will remain a major headwind for quite some time. Manufacturing inefficiencies and logistic challenges are expected to keep playing spoilsports. Additionally, massive R&amp;D expenses for the development of high-tech cars would also likely strain near-term cash flows.Soaring EV Popularity: Amid all the gloom and doom, buyers’ inclination toward green cars is a silver lining. Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles’ adoption by both automakers as well as customers. Legacy automakers are going the extra mile to gain a strong foothold in this red-hot e-mobility space. Demand for electric cars is off the charts. While sales of passenger vehicles declined last year, EV sales in the country shot up 65%. In fact, sales of EVs topped 5% of U.S. new vehicle sales for the first time in 2022. The EV momentum is likely to offer some respite.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 20-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it in the bottom 33% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 20.5% over the past three months.Despite the industry’s tepid near-term prospects, we will present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio. Before that, let’s take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost 40.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector’s decline of 11.5% and 34%, respectively, over the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 11.27X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.87X and the sector’s 12.21X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 53.78X, as low as 8.44X and at a median of 15.05X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)3 Stocks Worth Holding OntoGeneral Motors: This legacy U.S. automaker’s hot-selling brands in America, like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra, are driving its top line. General Motors’ massive EV push is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. This year, it will have nine EV models in the North America market. Solid demand for GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, Cadillac crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Blazer EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600 are expected to buoy top-line growth. General Motors has enough cash on the balance sheet to weather short-term headwinds and navigate economic cycles. The firm had total automotive liquidity of $39.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2022, including $24.4 billion of cash/cash equivalents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM’s 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 3.2%. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 10 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 13 cents over the past 30 days. General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of A.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: GMPACCAR: PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising XF, XG and XD models, augurs well. New launches have improved the company's product mix. PACCAR's accelerated efforts toward electrification and connected vehicle services are praiseworthy.Continued growth in the aftermarket parts—which is a high margin and a less cyclic business— thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine bodes well.High truck utilization and increased average fleet age are positively impacting PACCAR Parts results. The company’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+/A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR’s 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 13% and 6.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 13 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has increased by a cent over the past 30 days. PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of A.Price and Consensus: PCARHarley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle maker in the United States is reaping the benefits of its Hardwire strategic plan.The Hardwire strategy aims at long-term profitability and growth through refreshed product offerings. In sync with its long-term growth objectives to streamline its product portfolio, Harley-Davidson will be focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with market trends. As an integral part of its Hardwire strategy, Harley-Davidson launched an online platform for its used motorcycles, namely HD-1, last year. The H-D1 marketplace platform is also set to fuel the company's prospects. The LiveWire unit—dedicated to e-bikes— will particularly help the company gain a solid foothold in a sportier market environment with its innovative and differentiated offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOG’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 7%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 4 cents over the past seven days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 5 cents over the past seven days.

AAL is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio.

The fervor over the sport along with PNC's commitment to closing the economic gender gap has played a significant role in the Greater Los Angeles market's designation as The Official Women's Business Champion for the Angel City Football Club. 1The majority women-owned team, part of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), was founded by actor and activist Natalie Portman, entrepreneur Julie Uhrman and venture capitalist Kara Nortman. Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian is the lead investor, and more than 100 other celebrities, athletes and tech industry leaders serve as founding investors. The club's business model includes a community impact initiative that identifies and implements programs to accelerate women's financial equality and dedicates additional funding equivalent to 10% of its sponsorship dollars toward equity for diverse groups and education.Angel City wrapped up its inaugural 2022 season on the heels of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team's (USWNT) pay equity victory - a movement Uhrman, the team's co-founder and president, credits with inspiring the formation of the Angel City team. 2""We had this idea that we could build a business, a culture and a community reflective of our values, reflective of our city and reflective of what we ultimately wanted - equity,"" Uhrman says.Championing WomenIn addition to supporting one of the LA's favorite pastimes, PNC's status as The Official Women's Business Champion for the team aligns with PNC's decades-long contributions to advocating for the success of women who are financial decision-makers and its more recent Project 257®:Accelerating Women's Financial Equality initiative.PNC launched Project 257 after the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Gender Gap Report revealed it would take women 257 years to economically catch up to men if progress continued at its current pace.3Story continues""There is a broad spectrum of opportunities to close the economic gender gap, and Angel City's business model is an example of how women are reimagining paths toward financial equality,"" says Beth Marcello, director of women's business development at PNC. ""When these kinds of innovative moves are developed across a greater number of industries, together we should be able to close the gap before two more centuries pass.""As a part of its partnership with Angel City, PNC's Organizational Financial Wellness Program conducts financial education workshops with the team's front-office staff and players while also providing other resources to help the organization and its members thrive.Members of the organization also have access to dozens of PNC-Certified Women's Business Advocates (WBAs) across the Greater Los Angeles market. The WBAs in LA are part of the bank's coast-to-coast network of more than 4,700 colleagues who are dedicated to supporting the financial success of women, including those who own or lead businesses.Commitment and ImpactPNC entered the Greater Los Angeles market after the 2021 acquisition of BBVA USA and began doing business there using its national main street banking approach.""Being new to this market, we want to make sure we are involved in the Greater LA community in impactful ways, and the sponsorship with Angel City aligns with so many of PNC's commitments that it was just a perfect fit,"" says Todd Wilson, PNC regional president for Greater Los Angeles.LA sits at the top of the list for best U.S. cities for soccer fans, and Wilson believes the sponsorship offers PNC the opportunity to leverage heavy local interest in the sport to further awareness about the importance of gender financial equity.4A Fund for Future Off FieldPNC also helped Angel City launch its Player 22 Future Program to prepare players for life after playing on the field. Retired players may apply for grants that help them continue their careers in sports - whether as a commentator, analyst, coach, general manager or president of a team.""We've experienced the benefit of having former U.S. and international team players as owners of Angel City,"" says Uhrman, ""and we want to make sure we can get more former players back into the sport that they helped to build.""The club needed $100,000 to launch the Player 22 program. By midyear in 2022, just a few months into fundraising, they were almost at the goal, and that's when PNC stepped in to close the gap.""That wasn't even part of our sponsorship agreement, but Lou Cestello, head of regional markets at PNC, looked at me and reiterated that this is a partnership, and what is important to Angel City is important to PNC,"" Uhrman recalls. ""I think that is such an unbelievable example of how PNC goes the extra mile.""PNC and Angel City are now expanding the concept of the Player 22 program in a greater way. Ten percent of the bank's Angel City sponsorship will be reallocated to a new grant program that is available to players who aspire to launch or build their own social enterprises and businesses once they retire. Angel City forward Jasmyne Spencer is one of those players who could benefit from the program. Spencer has already started preparing for life after soccer with the launch of her sustainable lifestyle brand, Jas It Up.""I think this is the first time you can see a team use their platform to its full potential to push toward financial equality and future stability for its athletes,"" Spencer says. ""It is really gratifying to know that you represent something bigger than the sport by being a part of this team.""

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).26 Companies that Donate to NonprofitsPixabay/Public domainOur MethodologyWe started off by finding as many companies as we could with nonprofit donation initiatives.

REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon (Thierry Gouegnon / reuters)Kodali pointed to a decline in discretionary spending, particularly for physical goods.

Target’s makeup sales have also been boosted by the retail giant’s 40 new beauty brands, including clean and Black-owned brands.""In beauty, we continue to be a market leader, delivering the highest growth rates of any category we sell,"" Hennington said in the Q4 earnings call.

I am delighted to be here with you as we report our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. As noted in the headlines of our release, our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth was 23% for the fourth quarter and 27% for fiscal year 2022. These are fabulous results and I am grateful to the entire Westrock Coffee team who worked tirelessly all year to deliver. Ask anyone on the team and they can tell you 2022 was a year of unbelievable accomplishment amidst staggering challenges. We became a public company during a very difficult time for the public equity markets and have been one of the best performing new issues of 2022. This transaction allowed us to delever our balance sheet and provided us access to enough capital to build out not only the first, but also the second phase of our new Conway, Arkansas extract and ready-to-drink facility.With well over half of the capacity of this combined facility already under sales contracts with leading RTD coffee brands, we are excited to be positioned to enter a completely new era of EBITDA creation over the next two years to three years. And while we plan for the future, we operate in the here and now. In 2022, we encountered significant number of operational level challenges. We began 2022 with the onset of the Omicron COVID variant which delayed an expected economic recovery and then faced a surge of inflation and gasoline price hikes through the summer, all of which negatively impacted our business. Our year ended with the late arrival of significant production equipment for our single-serve and extract units, which created customer delivery issues and negatively impacted our cost and margins.Our team had to fight for every inch of progress in every season of what could have otherwise been a fairly impressive and reasonably easy year. Yet through all the good and the bad of 2022, our team worked tirelessly to deliver record adjusted EBITDA up 20%, while also making significant advances on integrating and improving our internal operations, sales and support functions. These advances, coupled with the recent arrival in on-boarding of our long-delayed manufacturing equipment have set us up for another record year in 2023, even as we continued to spend as needed to build the scaled platform necessary to monetize the value of our new Conway extracts and RTD plant, which when fully online is set to expand our EBITDA, not by percentage factors, but quite possibly by multiples.Before I turn the call over to Chris Pledger, our CFO, let me say a word about two acquisitions we made over the past few months. In November, we closed on the acquisition of Kohana Coffee, an extract in RTD business in Richmond, California. This acquisition was important for us and that it allowed us to add several new customers on our beverage solutions platform, and more importantly, it allowed us to accelerate the development, production and distribution of RTD products in cans and multi-serve bottles for key existing customers. Similarly the acquisition of Bixby Roasting in February allowed us to expand our growing influencer-led sales channel and add two outstanding sales executives to our team. Miles Fisher and Remington Hotchkis are going to be impact players for Westrock Coffee overtime.These kind of incremental gains expand our platform and help drive growth as we build for our future. They are exactly the kind of acquisition opportunities we remain focused on today. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris who will walk you through our recent financial performance.Pixabay/Public DomainChris Pledger: Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter and our full year 2022 results and then I will provide some commentary on our outlook for 2023. Total company net sales for the fourth quarter increased 20% year-over-year to $227.7 million, while gross profit excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments decreased $1 million to $37 million. Our sales growth was driven by 57% increase in single-serve cut volumes and increased pricing from the pass-through of higher underlying green coffee prices for the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 6% decrease in roast and ground coffee volumes. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit was driven by higher material and production labor costs due to inflation, in-period and out-of-period inventory adjustments and our continued efforts to absorb the 57% growth year-over-year in single-serve cut volumes.Despite these headwinds, our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $17.5 million, an increase of approximately 23% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by reductions in SG&amp;A, primarily related to personnel cost savings. For the full year 2022, net sales were $867.9 million, while gross profit excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments was $156.3 million, an increase of 10% compared to full year 2021. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for 2022 grew 27% to $60.1 million coming in at the low end of our guided range. As we outlined in our third quarter call, our 2022 financial results were impacted by three main factors. First, the Omicron COVID variant in the first quarter followed by rapidly rising inflation through the middle part of the year had a significant negative impact on U.S. consumer spending.This impacted our business in the form of lower product sales and our away-from-home channels, particularly in restaurants and convenient stores, and inflation impacted labor cost freight and material costs across all of our products. Second, it took longer and cost more in terms of equipment, labor and materials to absorb the 50% year-over-year growth in our single-serve cup orders. As Scott mentioned, we have put additional manufacturing equipment into service in the first quarter of 2023, which is leveling out these service issues and we have additional equipment coming online in the second quarter, which will free up additional capacity. As we continued to grow our single-serve platform, we feel very good about our ability to more efficiently monetize these increased product volumes.Finally, our team has performed really well in 2022, staying disciplined and focusing on the levers we have to pull in order to respond to these significant macroeconomic and operational challenges. On a segment basis, our beverage solutions segment contributed $192.6 million in net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022, which represents year-over-year growth of 28%. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $15.2 million, increasing 31% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, our beverage solutions segment generated $54 million adjusted EBITDA, a 30% increase over 2021, driven by 50% growth in our single-serve cut volumes and 8% growth in our flavors, extracts and ingredients products, which were partially offset by a 7% decrease in roast and ground coffee volumes.As we said before, an important part of our growth algorithm is the mix shift over time into our higher margin single-serve and flavors, extracts and ingredient products. We continued to see that shift in customer demand and our 2022 results validates this continuing trend. Turning towards our sustainable sourcing and traceability segment or SS&amp;T, sales net of intersegment revenues were $35.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 12% compared to the fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $2.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreased volumes in the quarter. For the full year, our SS&amp;T segment contributed sales net of intersegment revenues of $182.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million growing 24% and 7%, respectively, compared to 2021.These increases are driven by a higher average sales price per pound for green coffee, which grew 35% year-over-year, as sales volume decreased approximately 9% from 2021 levels. The increase in average sales price per pound is directly correlated to global commodity prices. During the year, the volume of green coffee from our SS&amp;T segment that is utilized by our beverage solution segment grew 173%, which is important and that it keeps margin within the system and it expands the coverage of our traceable and transparent supply chain. With respect to our capital expenditures, during the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $40 million of CapEx, $30 million of which was growth capital related to our extract and RTD facility in Conway, Arkansas.These expenditures primarily consisted of infrastructure spending and equipment deposits for our glass and can lines. In addition, we incurred $5 million of growth CapEx tied to the continued single-serve capacity expansion in our Little Rock, Arkansas facility. This single-serve CapEx is already having a benefit in 2023 as new machines are allowing us to increase production to align with customer demand and to improve the overall efficiency of our single-serve cup operation. On a project basis, we continued to anticipate that the total CapEx cost of Phases 1 and 2 of our Conway extract and RTD facility will be $275 million and that once it's fully online, we will generate approximately $100 million in EBITDA per year. As Scott mentioned, this project remains on time and on budget, and we look forward to the first product being produced in Conway in the first quarter of 2024.At quarter end, we had approximately $192 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments. Our consolidated net leverage ratio at December 31st was 2.9 times based on fourth quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA. We believe we have ample access to liquidity to achieve our near-term growth targets and capital expenditure needs. As we look ahead to 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 10% and 25%, which translates to a range of $66 million to $75 million in adjusted EBITDA. This guidance represents our current expectations regarding the performance of the business. However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. We expect our 2023 financial performance to be driven by several significant new customer and product wins that will come online in 2023.Growth in our extract volume as our expansion project in Concord, North Carolina is complete in May and we benefit from the volume growth that expansion allows. Growth in single-serve cup volumes as we get the full year benefit of the increased single-serve volume we experienced in the second half of 2022. Growth in RTD can sales as we continued to scale our operations in Richmond, California. And operational improvements we are putting in place to more efficiently monetize all of these opportunities. We will continue to closely manage costs in our existing business, while we continued to invest in the equipment, and more importantly, in the team that will deliver the growth to come from our Conway extract and RTD facility in 2024. With that, I will hand the call back over to the Operator for questions.See also 15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal or Illegal and 15 Biggest Chinese State-Owned Companies.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 26.2% loss over the past four weeks.Yesterday, the Federal Reserve announced that it lent around $300 billion to cash-strapped banks in the past week following the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. This indicates the first instance of the central bank’s assistance to the financial sector to help reduce the contagion risk of further bank runs. The Fed has lent an additional $11.9 billion under the new expansive emergency lending program announced on Sunday. Such funding will help banks meet depositors’ withdrawals. These favorable developments have likely rebounded investors’ confidence in the banking system, which drove Regions Financial's share price.This holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.6%. Revenues are expected to be $1.98 billion, up 23.9% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Regions Financial, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

The small cap Russell 2000 took the day's biggest losses, falling more than 2.5% as the index's weight toward regional banks — which stands at about 16% — put the index under heavier pressure than its larger peers.The bulk of Friday's selling pressure came in the financial sector, with shares of First Republic falling 33% after getting a lifeline from its larger industry peers on Thursday.Regional banks continued to face the most pressure, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 6% on Friday.Major money center banks like JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) all fell more than 3% on Friday. Over the last month, shares of Wells Fargo and Bank of America have lost more than 20%; the KRE regional banking ETF has lost closer to 30% over that period.Stocks rallied sharply on Thursday after news broke big banks led by JPMorgan and Bank of America were set to infuse First Republic with capital in what amounted to an industry bailout of the struggling bank.The firms eventually announced their deal to backstop First Republic about a half hour before the market close. Speaking with Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, longtime banking analyst Dick Bove said following these moves the near-term banking crisis is ""over."" Friday's market action suggested concerns from investors remain into the weekend over the longer-run prospects of these firms.Story continuesAfter opening lower on Friday, investors reacted positively to the day's biggest economic data point — the preliminary read on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan — which showed inflation expectations falling to the lowest level since April 2021.The report also noted its survey was 85% complete at the time of Silicon Valley Bank's failure, meaning initial reactions to that event from consumers won't roll in until later this month.First Republic Bank headquarters is seen on March 16, 2023 in San Francisco, California, United States. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Investors were also tracking the price of crude oil, with WTI crude down losing more than 3.1% to settle at $66.19 a barrel, a roughly 15-month low as oil prices have come under heavy pressure in the last week amid supply concerns and worries about a global economic slowdown.A rally in the dollar and gold this week spurred by investors seeking safe havens amid banking system worries also pressured oil prices.The Treasury market also remained a source of investor stress with the 10-year yield settling just under 3.4% on Friday, a precipitous drop from the 4% level seen just last week.In a note to clients on Thursday, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group highlighted how some of the recent volatility in the Treasury market — in particular with shorter-dated Treasuries that tend to be more sensitive to Fed expectations — has likely come from ""forced (that is, non-discretionary) buying and selling, and the prices that price-insensitive buyers or sellers agree to are not necessarily incorporating all information available.""""Another example is the massive inflow of cash to money market funds this week reported by ICI: total fund assets rose by 2.5% or $121bn, and money funds are forced to put that cash to work adding to short-term interest rate buying pressure,"" the firm wrote. ""Collapsing bill yields and very high volatility are consistent with the idea that the money fund flows are forcing purchases in specific markets.""In a note to clients on Friday, Thomas Mathews, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, echoed this view, noting the front-end of the Treasury curve now implies the Fed's benchmark interest rate ending 2023 about 2 percentage points below where investors expected just a week ago.""There's a good chance, in our view, that investors are now underestimating how much central bankers will raise rates over the next couple of months,"" Mathews wrote. ""As such, we suspect the rally in short-dated bonds could go into reverse.""The Fed will announce its next policy decision on Wednesday, March 22, with investors pricing in a roughly 60% chance the central bank raises rates by another 0.25%, according to data from the CME Group.Friday's close also marked a reshuffle in some sectors of the S&amp;P 500, with S&amp;P reclassifying 14 stocks in the index into new sectors as of today's close.The most notable names on the move include Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), and Dollar Tree (DLTR), which will move from the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) sector to Consumer Staples (XLP). Other notable companies moving sectors include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and PayPal (PYPL), which will move from Technology (XLK) into Financials (XLF).Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

222,0edf6553-2a48-3379-8c95-9f3588f0bfe7,V,2023-03-17,Investors Heavily Search Visa Inc. (V): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-visa-inc-130001897.html,1678971601,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this global payments processor have returned -5.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.9% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has lost 7.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share, indicating a change of +10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.43 points to a change of +12.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.56 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.7%. The $32.24 billion and $35.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +10.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +8.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 12.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marriott due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Marriott Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenues Top Estimates, Rise Y/YMarriott reported impressive fourth-quarter 2022 results, with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.During the quarter, the company reported improvements in revenue per available room (RevPAR), occupancy and average daily rate (ADR) on account of solid leisure demand and recovery in business transient and group demand. It also stated benefits from its fee-driven, asset-light business model and price strength. With global trends improving, the company expects the growth momentum to continue in the upcoming periods as well.Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionIn the quarter under review, Marriott’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.96, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share.Quarterly revenues of $5,923 million surpassed the consensus mark of $5,614 million. The top line surged 33.2% on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, revenues from Base management and Franchise fee came in at $287 million and $658 million compared with $217 million and $520 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily backed by strength in lodging demand and unit growth. During the quarter, other non-RevPAR-related franchise fees came in at $215 million compared with $186 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by solid contributions from co-brand credit card fees.Story continuesRevPAR &amp; MarginsIn the quarter under review, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 4.6% (in constant dollars) compared with 2019 levels. The upside was primarily backed by a 12.8% increase in ADR from 2019 levels. However, occupancy declined 5.1% from 2019 levels.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in the Asia Pacific (excluding China) increased 5.5% (in constant dollars) from 2019 levels. Occupancy declined 4.8% from 2019 levels, but ADR inched up 12.8% from 2019 levels. Comparable system-wide RevPAR in Greater China fell 42.3% from 2019 levels.On a constant-dollar basis, international comparable system-wide RevPAR increased 3.4% from 2019 levels. Occupancy declined 8.3% from 2019 levels. However, ADR was up 17.3% from 2019 levels. Comparable system-wide RevPAR in Europe increased 7.4%, while RevPAR in the Caribbean &amp; Latin America increased 27.6% from 2019 levels.Total expenses during the quarter increased 29.3% year over year to $4,927 million, primarily owing to a rise in Reimbursed expenses.During the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to $1,090 million compared with $741 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance sheetAt the end of the fourth quarter, Marriott's total debt amounted to $10.1 billion compared with $8.4 billion reported in the previous quarter. Cash and cash equivalents, as of Dec 31, 2022, came in at $0.5 billion compared with $1 billion reported in the previous quarter.Year to date (through Feb 10, 2023), the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of its common stock worth approximately $400 million.Unit DevelopmentsAt the end of fourth-quarter 2022, Marriott's development pipeline totaled 3,028 hotels, with approximately 496,000 rooms. Nearly 199,000 rooms were under construction.During the quarter, the company added 145 new properties (22,589 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio. For 2023, the company anticipates net room growth in the range of 4-4.5% year over year.OutlookFor first-quarter 2023, the company anticipates gross fee revenues in the range of $1,045-$1,065 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $980 million and $1,005 million. The company expects first-quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) to be between $1.82 and $1.88.For the first quarter, the company anticipates worldwide system-wide RevPAR to increase 30-32% growth from 2022 levels. RevPAR in the United States and Canada is expected to increase 25-27% from 2022 levels. Meanwhile, international RevPAR is expected to lie in the range of 47-49% from 2022 levels.For 2023, the company anticipates gross fee revenues in the range of $ $4,325-$4,555 million. General and administrative expenses for 2023 are projected to be between $935 million and $915 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $4,030 million to $4,300 million. The company expects 2023 diluted EPS in the range of $7.23-$7.91.2022 HighlightsTotal revenues in 2022 came in at $20,773 million compared with $13,857 million in 2021.Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 came in at $3,853 million compared with $2,278 million in 2021.In 2022, adjusted diluted EPS came in at $6.69 compared with $3.19 reported in the previous year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 11.6% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Marriott has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Marriott has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA How Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry?As you can see below, NVIDIA had US$11.0b of debt, at January 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$13.3b in cash, so it actually has US$2.34b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At NVIDIA's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$6.56b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$13.3b in cash and US$3.83b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.96b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$629.8b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesIn fact NVIDIA's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 44% in the last twelve months. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. While NVIDIA has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, NVIDIA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 82% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that NVIDIA has US$2.34b in net cash. The cherry on top was that in converted 82% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$3.8b. So we are not troubled with NVIDIA's debt use. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with NVIDIA .If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.Inflation is finally showing signs of cooling off. The CPI report for February was in-line with expectations, with the all-items index rising 6% year over year. We also received a positive surprise after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a better than expected PPI report that shows the producer price index falling 0.1% in February from where it was in January. We also received a negative revision of 0.4% for the PPI data reported in January, now showing that the PPI for the month increased by 0.3% and not 0.7%.""If They Suddenly Go Zero, It Could Worry The Market""The economic data at hand and the implosion of SVB have been received by the markets to price in a 25 basis point rate hike at the next FOMC meeting. On March 16 Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at Wharton, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his view of what the Fed will do, and also what he thinks the Fed should do at the March meeting. Professor Siegel noted that he has been critical of Fed policy since the last 3 quarters and thinks that the situation at Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) and the implosion of SVB might give the Fed a reality check and redirect their focus from fighting inflation to preventing an economic downturn.Professor Siegel thinks that the Fed should not raise rates at the March meeting and he also noted that they should not have raised rates in January either. Professor Siegel noted that the Fed should have redirected their focus earlier on preventing a slowdown, instead of combating inflation. According to professor Siegel the Fed should not raise rates. However, he expects a quarter point rate hike at the March meeting, but with a relatively dovish tone. Professor Siegel expects a 25 bps rate hike because if the Fed abruptly stops its hiking cycle ""it could worry the market"" and so ""a more measured way of doing it is 25 (bps) with a pause"".Story continuesThe stock market is increasingly volatile right now, as the ramifications of SVB have spelled trouble for the global banking industry and inflation remains hot.

""The FOX FUTURE project represents a long-term commitment to our industry, to our community, and to the City of Los Angeles.""FOX FUTURE represents a historic investment in support of both the entertainment industry and Los Angeles' Century City business community that will:Build new multi-media sound stages as well as post-production facilities, basecamps, and media campus offices to respond to changing technologies and increased demand in film and television production.Create an opportunity for much sought after top-of-class general office space in Century City with a new LEED-Platinum office building along Avenue of the Stars.Honor the significant legacy of this historic property.Maintain thousands of existing jobs by helping to curb runaway production and create new jobs throughout Southern California.Generate approximately $9 million in direct annual revenue to the City of Los Angeles that will help fund public services such as libraries, parks, police and fire services.Provide over $20 million in anticipated Transportation Improvement and Mitigation Fees which focus on West Los Angeles specific improvements.Advance sustainability efforts on the FOX Studio Lot with two new LEED-Platinum office buildings and other sustainability measures.Invest in West Los Angeles transit solutions and further support the much-anticipated Metro D-Line when it opens to Century City in 2025.Story continuesNEW &amp; MODERN PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTUREThrough the productions that have been brought to life on the FOX Studio Lot, families witnessed a Miracle on 34th Street, the world fell in love with the Sound of Music, the fourth major American broadcast network was launched, live sports broadcasting was revolutionized, and FOX viewers gained an insatiably mischievous kid brother named Bart Simpson. However, motion picture and television production has fundamentally changed with innovative new technologies introduced every day as the entertainment industry continues to evolve. More so, Los Angeles continues to struggle to meet the demand for sound stages, which is increasingly driving production and entertainment jobs outside the region.With FOX FUTURE, FOX will add nine net new sound stages to the Lot, bringing the number of stages to 24. Additional stages—equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and designed for modern film, television and content creation—will help meet entertainment industry demand and keep jobs in Los Angeles.Additionally, the project will create a LEED-Platinum designed media campus office building to support FOX Studio Lot operations. Located on the Lot along Olympic Boulevard, the 24-floor building will focus on creating collaborative open spaces and shared and private offices, all designed specifically for film and television production.AVENUE OF THE STARS BUILDING Century City is one of the world's most prestigious business districts, and home to global corporations, entertainment giants, and emerging entrepreneurs within steps of premium retail, dining, hotels, and ever improving public transit. In Century City today, particularly along Avenue of the Stars, there are few opportunities for new construction and office occupancy rates remain the among highest in Los Angeles.With FOX FUTURE, FOX could seek a development partner to transform the northeast portion of the Lot along Avenue of the Stars into a world class, state-of-the-art building with 35 floors of office above seven floors of parking. Designed to meet LEED-Platinum standards, it would further activate the Avenue with its new public plaza and provide convenient access to the much-anticipated Metro D-line and allow for both direct connection to the Lot and entirely independent office space. Demonstrating a significant investment in the City's future, the proposed office building would be designed to attract a notable corporate presence and provide a new headquartering opportunity in Century City.ECONOMIC IMPACTFOX FUTURE is expected to be a major economic driver for the City of Los Angeles, responsible for an expected $1.5 billion in economic impact throughout Los Angeles County and will generate approximately $9 million annually in tax dollars that can be used to fund public services such as schools, libraries and emergency response services, underscoring FOX's commitment to the community.TRANSIT INVESTMENTFOX FUTURE is a transit-focused project focused on investing in transportation solutions and mitigating the impact of development. It will activate the new D-Line's ridership potential while also enhancing connectivity for pedestrians and multi-modal travelers and implementing various strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled. The program will be consistent with the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles Department of Transportation policies and procedures, including localized transportation-related goals detailed in The West Los Angeles Transportation Improvement and Mitigation Specific Plan.SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTAs part of Fox Corporation, the FOX Studio Lot has a strong commitment to sustainability. Today on the Lot, FOX continues to take steps to reduce carbon emissions, pursue clean energy and responsibly dispose of waste. With FOX FUTURE, FOX will further these efforts by using green and recycled building materials, expanding solar infrastructure, installing green walls, reducing water consumption, and designing both the media campus office and Avenue of the Stars general office buildings to achieve LEED-Platinum standards.PRESERVING THE LEGACYThe FOX Studio Lot has played an important role in the history of film and television and that impact will be honored as part of the project. Even today and independent of FOX FUTURE, FOX is securing the legacy of the Lot with the upgrade of New York Street, the seismic retrofit of identified buildings and the renovation and reinvention of the FOX Sports Studio A, incorporating cutting-edge graphics technology.With FOX FUTURE, FOX will continue to preserve the legacy of this important filming location with an updated Historic Preservation Plan that painstakingly relocates key buildings on the Lot and ensures the architectural character of this site is honored.Additional details about FOX FUTURE as well as images, maps, project updates and more are available at www.FOXFUTURE.com.ABOUT FOX CORPORATIONFox Corporation produces and distributes compelling news, sports, and entertainment content through its primary iconic domestic brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment and FOX Television Stations, and leading AVOD service Tubi.

Cultural touchstone movies brought to life there include ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""The Sound of Music.""Fox Corp., which retained ownership of the lot when Walt Disney Co. bought most of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets in 2019, submitted an amended plan to Los Angeles building officials Wednesday calling for the addition of office towers, soundstages and other facilities used to make television shows and movies.The investment reflects the nearly nonstop demand for stages that has emerged in the streaming television age and Fox's desire to further profit from one of its most cherished assets. Fox's plans include a high-rise more than 30 stories tall on Avenue of the Stars that could be rented to tenants looking for fancy digs in Century City's thriving office market.""Our vision is to secure the future of the lot by investing in production infrastructure and the Century City business core,"" said Gary Ehrlich, president and general manager of Fox Studio Lot.A view of the exterior wall of Stage 10 at the Fox Studio covered with a mural depicting a scene from 1955 comedy ""The Seven Year Itch."" (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)The moneymaking potential of the busy 53-acre studio lot on Pico Boulevard was clear when the Murdochs carved it out of the $71.3-billion deal with Disney that put Captain America and Wolverine on the same team four years ago and led to the creation of Fox Corp.Lachlan Murdoch, the elder son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, runs Fox Corp. as its chief executive and keeps an office on the Fox lot once occupied by illustrious studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck. Rupert Murdoch is chairman of the company.“The Fox Studio Lot is one of the most iconic and treasured production locations in the history of entertainment and is a rich part of our history,” Lachlan Murdoch said in a statement. The proposed expansion project, he said, ""represents a long-term commitment to our industry, to our community, and to the City of Los Angeles.” Story continuesFox Corp. is made up of former 21st Century Fox assets that were not included in the Disney deal including the studio property, Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Entertainment and Fox Television Stations.Disney is the lot’s primary tenant, occupying office and production space. Among the shows it produces there are two of Fox’s most popular series: “9-1-1” and “9-1-1: Lone Star.” Sports programs such as ""Fox NFL Sunday,"" ""MLB on Fox"" and ""The Herd With Colin Cowherd"" are based there.The lot also remains the home of the writers room for “The Simpsons,” which has aired on Fox for more than 30 years.Although new office high-rises have been rare in Los Angeles in recent decades, rental activity suggests there could be demand for another big building in Century City that would rise next to a shuttered hotel south of the 2121 Avenue of the Stars office tower. That red-granite and glass building was formerly called Fox Plaza but may be better known to movie fans as fictional Nakatomi Plaza, where Bruce Willis fought terrorists in ""Die Hard.""At a time when most office centers including downtown Los Angeles are experiencing a slowdown in leasing caused in part by companies' shifts to remote work and fears of a slowing economy, the Century City neighborhood stands out as a robust market commanding some of the highest rents in the region.""It's probably the strongest office market in Southern California,"" said property broker Carl Muhlstein of JLL, who specializes in entertainment real estate deals.Only 8.5% of offices in Century City are unleased — compared with 19.4% countywide — according to brokerage CBRE, and landlords there ask for rents 50% above the county average.There are few locations left in the neighborhood to build big office buildings. Last year one of Hollywood's leading talent agencies, Creative Artists Agency, agreed to become the anchor tenant in a 37-story tower being built on Avenue of the Stars, where construction activity is still mostly underground. Other businesses have agreed to move in when it opens in 2026.""The CAA tower hasn't even risen above sea level,"" Muhlstein said, ""and it's already 50% leased.""Upgrades on the Fox lot would add nine soundstages, bringing the number of stages to 24. The additional stages would be equipped with the latest technologies for modern film, television and content creation, Fox said.Also planned is an office building more than 20 stories tall that would be designed specifically for people working for companies based on the lot. It would rise along Olympic Boulevard west of Avenue of the Stars.The Fox lot today holds a hodgepodge of old and new buildings built for both administration and production services, including four scoring and mixing stages, two broadcast studios, theaters, editing bays and other production facilities. It has 96 buildings with a combined total of 1.8 million square feet. The planned development would add 1.6 million square feet.Fox's announced expansion comes on the heels of another huge proposed makeover revealed last month by the owners of Radford Studio Center in Studio City. Hackman Capital Partners said it plans to spend $1 billion to upgrade the former CBS Studio Center with as much as 1 million square feet of new soundstages, production facilities and offices.The rise of streaming has escalated demand for soundstages and other production facilities and prompted the development of new studios around the Los Angeles region.Existing soundstages in Los Angeles County have been almost fully rented for years, which can make it hard for new productions to find places to work, according to FilmLA, the nonprofit that handles film permits in the region.""There's just this unmitigated demand for not only stages but all the production support that goes with mounting productions at a particular location,"" Ehrlich said.Studios are operating near 100% capacity with wait lists as long as five film productions deep for those spaces, financial advisor Deloitte said in a 2021 report.“To meet the booming demand, supply would need to more than double in Los Angeles County” in the next few years, Deloitte said. Planned projects for more studio space fall far short of that.Fox Studios traces its lineage to co-founder William Fox’s 1924 purchase of 99 acres between Santa Monica and Pico boulevards from Janss Investment Co., the developers of Westwood Village. Fox Films merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935, forming 20th Century Fox.The lot grew to as large as 285 acres at its height but eventually shrank to its current size as the studio was hit with a string of flops, including the Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor vehicle “Cleopatra,” whose budget had ballooned before its 1963 release. Desperate for cash, studio bosses sold nearly 180 acres in 1961 to businessman William Zeckendorf and Aluminum Co. of America for the development of Century City.The city approval process for the latest proposed changes to the studio could be lengthy, Ehrlich said, but Fox hopes to get underway on new development in the next few years.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).26 Companies that Donate to NonprofitsPixabay/Public domainOur MethodologyWe started off by finding as many companies as we could with nonprofit donation initiatives.

If you want to see more best US stocks for foreigners, go directly to 5 Best US Stocks for Foreigners.Given the United States has the largest economy in the world, many foreigners invest in American stocks. Furthermore, many leading American companies are multinational, giving further geographic exposure and scale.The United States is also the home to the Federal Reserve, which is the world's leading central bank. Furthermore, it is home to Wall Street, which is the world's leading financial center.Although it is already one of the most developed countries in the world, the United States has a lot of growth potential in the future.For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.The United States has substantial population growth potential.The United States leads in AI which could help produce many innovative breakthroughs that increase domestic and potentially world GDP.Many multinational American companies also have substantial emerging market operations that could help with earnings growth in the future.Many leading American blue chips also pay a dividend and also buy back stock when they have excess capital.Near Term HeadwindsThe American economy is slowing currently.Recently, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank by assets in the country, failed in a few days given the bank failed to successfully raise enough equity that it needed and customers withdrew substantial deposits.Fearing contagion, the U.S. government stepped in to protect deposits at Silicon Valley Bank.CNBC said, ""Banking regulators devised a plan Sunday to backstop depositors with money at Silicon Valley Bank, a critical step in stemming a feared systemic panic brought on by the collapse of the tech-focused institution.""Although the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank are protected, the equity shareholders of the bank aren't and the failure worsened confidence in other banks, which could have ripple effects on U.S. economic growth.Story continuesWith the failure and the higher interest rates, there is potential for the U.S. economy to slow even further and as a result, the near term is pretty uncertain in the United States. Furthermore, if the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of stocks purchased in U.S. dollars could decrease, all else equal.Despite the near term headwinds which could lead to lower stock prices if economic data fails to meet expectations, the long term potential growth of leading blue chips in the United States is still pretty attractive. The United States has the world's leading economy, leads the world in innovation currently, and will likely remain the world's innovation leader in the future. With more innovation, there could be more total value created and many of today's leading blue chips in America could benefit as a result.For those of you interested check out 12 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy.Given individual companies can fail as Silicon Valley Bank showed and sectors can also underperform, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real Estate, InvestmentPhoto by Frans Ruiter on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners, we picked 15 stocks with competitive advantages that have headquarters in the United States and that are listed in either the NYSE or the NASDAQ.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners15. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is one of the biggest asset managers in the world that has a lot of scale and competitive advantages. Given the weaker market in 2022 and also dollar appreciation on average AUM, the company's full year revenue decreased 8% year over year and its full year operating income decreased 13% year over year as adjusted. Full year diluted EPS decreased 13% year over year as adjusted. While the near term could be uncertain this year, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has a very strong franchise and long term growth potential. Shares currently trade for a forward P/E of 15.98 as of March 14. Of the 943 hedge funds in our database, 49 owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q4.14. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the leading home improvement retailers in the world. While the company's customer base has been fairly resilient for most of fiscal 2022 with less price sensitivity than what would normally be expected given the persistent inflation, the company's fourth quarter 2022 comparables were slightly softer than anticipated. Given the rising interest rates and the potential for an economic slowdown, the company expects weaker demand in the near term as well. In February, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) said it saw FY23 revenue flat, and FY23 EPS down mid-single digits percentage range. Nevertheless, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has growth potential in the long term given the rising equity value of the total homes in the United States.13. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the leading discount retailers in the world with substantial scale. In fact, as of the end of FY2022, the company operated 10,635 total retail units globally, with 4,717 Walmart stores in the United States and 5,318 Walmart International stores. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:LOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a leading home improvement retailer that like The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is facing near term softness in demand. In Q4 2022, for instance, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)'s comparable sales declined 0.7% year over year and the company sees FY23 comparable sales flat to down 2% year over year. While the company thinks there could be a 'slight decline' in the home improvement market in 2023, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) believes the long term outlook for the home improvement market is still strong given aging homes and the rising value of total homes.11. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a leading sport apparel maker that has faced headwinds such as foreign exchange and inventory challenges in the near term.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a leading consumer staples company that hasn't done very well given the difficult cost and operating environment partially as a result of the higher inflation. Nevertheless, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) benefits from China opening up and the company said in January it expects to pay around $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of shares in fiscal 2023. In the long term, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is still attractive given its strong brands and potential earnings power if inflation eventually normalizes.9. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks #9 on our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners given 74 hedge funds in our database owned shares of the leading investment bank at the end of Q4. Given the company's headwinds in the consumer sector, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) has narrowed its ambitions in consumer strategy and it is in the process of ceasing to offer new loans on the Marcus platform according to the company in January 2023. Going forward, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) hopes to grow its wealth and asset management business which generated $8.8 billion in management and other fees in 2022 and is expected to generate over $10 billion in management and other fees in 2024.8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a leading healthcare company that has faced headwinds given inflation and higher interest rates which have led to some lower valuations for leading stocks.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a leading entertainment company that has a forward P/E ratio of 16.97 as of March 14 given an economic slowdown could negatively affect the company's near term growth potential.

252,b3b5f1ea-493b-3ee9-a530-6a60a229bdef,AKAM,2023-03-17,Akamai Mitigates Record DDoS Attack in Asia-Pacific (900 Gbps),PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akamai-mitigates-record-ddos-attack-080900510.html,1679040540,STORY,['AKAM'],"[SINGAPORE, March 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, revealed that Akamai mitigated the largest DDoS attack ever launched against a customer based in Asia. In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, an attacker overwhelms its target with unwanted internet traffic so that normal traffic cannot reach its intended destination.Fig. 1: The attack was intense and short-lived, and was fully pre-mitigatedOn February 23, 2023, Akamai mitigated the attack which recorded traffic peaking at 900.1 gigabits per second and 158.2 million packets per second. The attack was intense and short-lived, with most attack traffic bursting during the peak minute of the attack. Traffic patterns returned to normal after only a few minutes (Figure 1).The attack was distributed across Akamai's scrubbing network, with all 26 of Akamai's fleet of scrubbing centers witnessing some amount of attack traffic. However, this was most heavily sourced from APAC (Figure 2), with the top locations being Hong Kong, Tokyo, São Paulo, Singapore, and Osaka, and forty-eight percent of traffic in-region.Mitigation strategyTo thwart the attack and safeguard the customer, Akamai Prolexic, a cloud-based DDoS scrubbing platform, was deployed to pre-mitigate the assault. The dedicated defense platform, that scales to several times the size of the largest publicly reported attacks, was deployed after an optimized DDoS incident response plan was launched by frontline responders. Over 225 frontline responders across six global locations with decades of expertise mitigating the most sophisticated attacks for the world's largest, most-demanding organizations, were involved to stop the attack. As a result of the proactive defense posture, there was no collateral damage for the customer.""The recent DDoS attack that Akamai mitigated in Asia serves as an important reminder that DDoS continues to be a pervasive threat that organizations here need to pay attention to. DDoS attacks continue to ramp up in the region because virtually every business is an online business today,"" explained Parimal Pandya, Managing Director, Asia Pacific and Japan, Akamai.Story continues""Customer experiences online are negatively impacted when a DDoS attack renders a site inaccessible, and connection is compromised. This inaccessibility jeopardizes consumer trust, and consistent disruptions will see them turning to alternative avenues instead,"" continued Pandya.Guidance on minimizing DDoS riskIn the wake of heightened operational risk, having a proven DDoS mitigation strategy is imperative for online businesses to thrive. To stay ahead of the latest threats, Akamai recommends the following:Immediately review and implement cybersecurity recommendations and guidelines by the local governmentReview critical subnets and IP spaces and ensure that they have mitigation controls in placeDeploy DDoS security controls in an always-on mitigation posture as a first layer of defense to avoid an emergency integration scenario and to reduce the burden on incident responders. Organizations without a trusted and proven cloud-based provider are advised to start their search for one.Proactively pull together a crisis response team and ensure incident response plans are up-to-date, including go-to contacts, and a runbook is available to provide guidance on procedures and operations that needs to be carried out in the event of a cyberattack.""DDoS attacks have increased consistently in APAC, both in size and frequency, over the past couple of years and have become a serious threat to business growth and stability. As organizations across all verticals conduct their business online, attackers seek to disrupt and degrade customer experience and the reputation of these businesses for financial gain,"" said Dean Houari, Director of Security Technology and Strategy, Asia Pacific and Japan, Akamai.""Specifically, cybercriminals continue to deploy DDoS as part of multi-faceted attacks to divert customer attention from data breaches and ransomware, or to coerce ransom payments. Thus, it is critical that organizations adopt the right DDoS security solution to detect and mitigate attacks at scale, while having the right teams to monitor such attacks, as suggested in the guidance on minimizing DDoS risks,"" he concluded.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

Shares have lost about 8.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Akamai Technologies due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Akamai Beats Q4 Earnings Estimates on Top-Line GrowthAkamai reported relatively healthy fourth-quarter 2022 results with year-year-year growth in revenues despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and adverse currency translation effects. Both the bottom line and top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on solid demand trends.Quarter DetailsGAAP net income in the reported quarter was $128.8 million or 82 cents per share compared with $160.5 million or 97 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The decline in GAAP earnings despite top-line growth was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $216.4 million or $1.37 per share compared with $243.1 million or $1.49 per share a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents.In 2022, GAAP net income declined to $523.7 million or $3.26 per share from $651.6 million or $3.93 per share in 2021. Non-GAAP net income in 2022 was $857.7 million or $5.37 per share compared with $942.6 million or $5.74 per share a year ago.Quarterly revenues of $927.8 million increased 2.5% year over year and beat the consensus estimate of $903 million. Growth in the Security Technology Group and Compute businesses primarily contributed to the top line. Region-wise, U.S. revenues were $482.8 million, up 1% year over year. International revenues were $445 million, up 4%.In 2022, total revenues jumped to $3,616.6 million from $3,461.2 million in 2021.By product groups, Security Technology Group revenues were $400.2 million, up 10% year over year, driven by growth in the application security business and solid performance from Guardicore.

TMUS has inked a definitive agreement to acquire Ka’ena Corporation for about $1.35 billion to consolidate its position as one of the leading wireless service providers in the country. The buyout will include Ka’ena subsidiaries and brands such as Mint Mobile – a budget wireless provider backed by actor Ryan Reynolds, Ultra Mobile – a wireless service provider catering to international calls, and Plum – a wholesale wireless solutions provider. The transaction is likely to be completed later this year, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions and regulatory approvals.Offering budget cell phone plans starting at $15 per month, Mint Mobile has established itself as a more affordable option for larger telecom companies. It utilizes the T-Mobile network as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), whereby it offers wireless mobile services using the latter’s communications network infrastructure without actually owning it. This, in turn, is likely to make the deal a seamless transition for its customers.Post-acquisition, the brands will continue to use the T-Mobile network to serve their existing customers. The company intends to leverage its own supplier relationships and distribution scale to help the brands expand further, enabling them to offer competitive pricing and greater device inventory to more U.S. consumers seeking value offerings.

Postpaid phone net customer additions were 927,000 in the fourth quarter, while prepaid net customer additions were 25,000 and 338,000 for the full year.Total net customer additions were 1.8 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the tally to a record 6.8 million for 2022. The total customer count at the end of 2022 increased to a record high of 113.6 million as it extended its coverage across the length and breadth of the country. The proposed buyout of Mint Mobile will further increase its customer count in the long run.Following its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile boasts an unrivaled bouquet of high- and low-band spectrum for a faster nationwide 5G rollout, undeniably disrupting the competitive landscape of the U.S. telecom market. To its credit, T-Mobile reportedly has the largest nationwide 5G network, with its Extended Range 5G covering more than 325 million people. The company is further strengthening its mid-band coverage by adding more towers and spectrum in places that already have 5G network connectivity.Shares of the company have gained 12% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 15.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchT-Mobile currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

Indeed, American investors may want to consider adjusting their strategies to accommodate future changes in the economy.On paper, circumstances appear quite swell. According to CNN, the U.S. economy added 311,000 jobs in February, outpacing expectations. So far, so good. However, we’re presently dealing with elevated inflation. Prior to the jobs report, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell left open the door for higher and quicker interest rate hikes. With the latest data, the central bank may have no choice but to go aggressively hawkish. If so, the Fed might find it extremely difficult to engineer a soft landing; that is, control inflation without sparking a recession. In turn, higher rates may reduce employment stats, leading to discombobulated workers.

February Jobs ReportSource: Mykola Komarovskyy / Shutterstock.comOn the surface level, mentioning staffing agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) as one of the stocks to buy because of a robust labor market doesn’t seem to make much sense. After all, with the job market so tight, employees can quickly find opportunities elsewhere. So, taking on the services of what effectively amounts to a middleman seems counterproductive.To be sure, RHI stock hasn’t really responded well recently. Last week, shares stumbled over 5%. And while RHI is up for the year, it’s down nearly 29% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, with the Fed likely to hike benchmark rates to combat inflation, the economy can slip into recession. Indeed, the mass layoffs we’ve seen since 2022 have now impacted other sectors beyond technology. Financially as well, RHI offers an intriguing opportunity for stocks to buy. For starters, the company enjoys stability in the balance sheet. Moreover, it’s an operational powerhouse. As an example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.3%, above nearly 68% of the industry. Its net margin is 9.09%, outpacing 71% of its peers. Therefore, it’s well worth looking into.Story continuesKelly Services (KELYA)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockAnother staffing agency, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) might seem an odd inclusion for stocks to buy on a strong jobs report. Under ordinary circumstances, I’d agree wholeheartedly. Why bother dealing with a middleman entity when you can easily secure a new opportunity in a tight labor market? However, my concern centers on sustainability. In other words, I just don’t think the employment market will be this robust moving forward.So yes, while KELYA appears ugly in terms of chart performance, it could make up ground. In particular, Kelly Services doesn’t just focus on white-collar office jobs. Rather, it also facilitates connections for people seeking jobs in warehouse operations. Again, with mass layoffs rising, people might start getting desperate and taking whatever they can. In this scenario, Kelly Services makes sense.Also, the company offers some enticing fiscal attributes. Perhaps most notably, KELYA pings as undervalued. Currently, the market prices KELYA at a forward multiple of 10.69. As a discount to earnings, Kelly Services ranks better than 70.19% of the field.Upwork (UPWK)The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.Source: Funstock / Shutterstock.comFor those that want to take an extreme risk with their stocks to buy, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) could be quite intriguing. During the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, many white-collar employers shifted labor to remote operations. However, a growing number of companies – with Covid-19 fading – have recalled their employees back to the office. The invariable conflict may present expansionary opportunities for the gig economy.To be sure, the gig economy – or the segment dealing with independent contractors (freelancers) – has always been an attractive concept. But now that a majority of white-collar workers got a taste of the gig lifestyle, they may want in full-time. If so, Upwork could benefit as a direct facilitator of freelance opportunities.In full disclosure, Upwork carries significant risks. Frankly, its balance sheet features dubious stats. As well, the enterprise is deeply unprofitable despite posting a very robust three-year revenue growth rate of 20.1%. That said, Wall Street analysts peg UPWK as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $18.22, implying almost 72% upside potential.U-Haul (UHAL)U-Haul van driving on a street in downtown San FranciscoSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comMentioning U-Haul (NYSE:UHAL) might seem an incredibly strange idea for stocks to buy on the latest jobs report. After all, with the labor market booming, presumably, no need for moving out of town exists. Sure enough, last Friday when we saw the jobs report, UHAL declined by over 3% of equity value.Nevertheless, UHAL gained nearly 2% since the Jan. opener. And in the trailing year, it’s up slightly over 4%. Fundamentally, one possible reason for the bullishness may center on anticipated migration trends. In particular, if the Fed fails to engineer a soft landing, a recession will likely materialize. Under such circumstances, it may be better for workers to move from high-cost metropolitan areas to lower-cost regions. Additionally, U-Haul enjoys some attractive financial metrics. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15%, outpacing 82.28% of its peers. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period pings at 40.3%, above 80.72% of the industry.Financially, the market prices UHAL at 7.14 times its operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median value is 11.17 times, making UHAL undervalued and thus one of the stocks to buy.Dollar Tree (DLTR)a figure of a shopper standing on top of a credit cardSource: ShutterstockAs mentioned earlier, on the surface, mentioning Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) as one of the stocks to buy during a period of robust labor activity seems bizarre. With people enjoying gainful employment, they can easily afford to go shopping at a proper grocery store. Heck, they might even skip cooking for themselves and go out and order in. However, the prospect of higher interest rates suggests that the jobs data may eventually hit a wall. Because the Fed’s main motivation focuses on controlling inflation, the employment sector may incur secondary importance. Put another way, some workers may really be pawns in the Fed’s high-stakes chess game to destroy inflation.If so, people will need access to vital consumer goods at the lowest price possible. Invariably, this will likely benefit discount dollar stores like Dollar Tree. To be fair, those bidding up DLTR will face risks. Frankly, the company’s balance sheet could be better. Nevertheless, Dollar Tree’s solid operational stats (particularly revenue and net margin) should make DLTR one of the stocks to buy.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAt a cursory level, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) appears a risky name for stocks to buy following a strong jobs report. In fairness, it is. For example, during the past 365 days, the Class C GOOG stock gave up more than 30% of its equity value. Still reeling from the shocks of 2022, GOOG desperately needs a positive catalyst to spark sustainable momentum.However, that catalyst may come in the form of a reverse of labor market gains. Let’s assume the Fed goes super-hawkish with its monetary policy. Subsequently, then, rising borrowing costs should hurt demand across the board, leading to mass layoffs. And we’re not just talking about some sectors being involved but possibly the majority. Where will axed worker bees turn to? Whether it’s searching for a new opportunity or looking for ways to get an edge (such as shoring up a resume), people will turn to Google. Over time, the influx of volume should boost digital advertising revenue, making GOOG one of the intriguing stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs a consumer tech giant tied to multiple areas, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes for one of the best stocks to buy. And that’s almost irrespective of context. However, under the scenario of a determined Fed ready to kill inflation, MSFT should command significant attention among market participants. With rising borrowing costs leading to job losses, Microsoft may be the ideal investment.How so? Simply, Microsoft owns LinkedIn. And you can almost take it to the bank that when layoffs increase in scope and scale, many will turn to the website. Personally, I’ve seen many of my LinkedIn contacts detail their labor market struggles in the hopes of finding new pastures. Some become quite successful in their pursuits. Besides, the base subscription to LinkedIn is free. So, you might as well take a shot. Finally, Microsoft enjoys very attractive financial metrics. From strong revenue to cash flow to profit margins, MSFT is stacked. To boot, it also benefits from a stable balance sheet. Therefore, it’s one of the stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

268,834ed99d-0670-312c-8a0d-d18fc264f053,PCAR,2023-03-17,3 Domestic Auto Stocks Well-Poised to Fend Off Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-domestic-auto-stocks-well-132101635.html,1678972861,STORY,"['PCAR', '^GSPC', 'HOG', 'GM']","[The prospects of the Zacks Domestic Auto industry look somewhat shaky at the moment amid rising recessionary fears, which may cool off demand for vehicles. A brewing banking crisis is adding fuel to the already weak economy mired by stubborn inflation and Fed’s hawkish stance. Many economists project that the United States could slip into recession sooner than expected. With consumers rather downbeat about economic outlook, they are less likely to spend heavily on high-ticket items, which may hurt vehicle sales. Additionally, high commodity and labor costs are adversely impacting the margins of the industry participants. While robust deliveries of electric vehicles (EV) are acting as a booster, the overall prospects of the industry don’t appear bright, at least for the near term.Nonetheless, we recommend keeping a close eye on three auto giants namely General Motors GM, PACCAR PCAR and Harley-Davidson HOG, which are better positioned to brave the multiple industry challenges.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.What's Shaping the Industry?Intensified Economic Uncertainty: At a time when the U.S. economy is already mired in uncertainty amid Fed’s aggressive rate hikes, the sudden collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank has just added to the gloom. The banking crisis has prompted Goldman Sachs to ratchet down U.S. GDP forecasts. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs lowered its U.S. growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 1.2% for 2023. The investment banking giant also raised the probability of a U.S. recession from 25% to 35%. The highly cyclical Domestic Auto industry is likely to feel the heat of a fragile economy. Demand for vehicles is expected to cool off as consumers are gradually becoming apprehensive about buying high-ticket items when recessionary fears are growing. While auto sales in 2022 fell to a decade low, primarily owing to supply chain issues, this year, the industry is likely to suffer from macroeconomic challenges. The supply crunch is most likely to morph into a demand slowdown in 2023.Story continuesHigh Commodity &amp; Operational Costs: Prices of raw materials like steel, aluminum and others are soaring and adversely impacting the gross margins. Commodity inflation, although gradually abating, is far from over. Most automakers have already warned that high raw materials and labor costs will remain a major headwind for quite some time. Manufacturing inefficiencies and logistic challenges are expected to keep playing spoilsports. Additionally, massive R&amp;D expenses for the development of high-tech cars would also likely strain near-term cash flows.Soaring EV Popularity: Amid all the gloom and doom, buyers’ inclination toward green cars is a silver lining. Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles’ adoption by both automakers as well as customers. Legacy automakers are going the extra mile to gain a strong foothold in this red-hot e-mobility space. Demand for electric cars is off the charts. While sales of passenger vehicles declined last year, EV sales in the country shot up 65%. In fact, sales of EVs topped 5% of U.S. new vehicle sales for the first time in 2022. The EV momentum is likely to offer some respite.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 20-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it in the bottom 33% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 20.5% over the past three months.Despite the industry’s tepid near-term prospects, we will present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio. Before that, let’s take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost 40.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector’s decline of 11.5% and 34%, respectively, over the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 11.27X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.87X and the sector’s 12.21X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 53.78X, as low as 8.44X and at a median of 15.05X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)3 Stocks Worth Holding OntoGeneral Motors: This legacy U.S. automaker’s hot-selling brands in America, like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra, are driving its top line. General Motors’ massive EV push is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. This year, it will have nine EV models in the North America market. Solid demand for GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, Cadillac crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Blazer EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600 are expected to buoy top-line growth. General Motors has enough cash on the balance sheet to weather short-term headwinds and navigate economic cycles. The firm had total automotive liquidity of $39.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2022, including $24.4 billion of cash/cash equivalents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM’s 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 3.2%. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 10 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 13 cents over the past 30 days. General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of A.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: GMPACCAR: PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising XF, XG and XD models, augurs well. New launches have improved the company's product mix. PACCAR's accelerated efforts toward electrification and connected vehicle services are praiseworthy.Continued growth in the aftermarket parts—which is a high margin and a less cyclic business— thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine bodes well.High truck utilization and increased average fleet age are positively impacting PACCAR Parts results. The company’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+/A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR’s 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 13% and 6.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 13 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has increased by a cent over the past 30 days. PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of A.Price and Consensus: PCARHarley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle maker in the United States is reaping the benefits of its Hardwire strategic plan.The Hardwire strategy aims at long-term profitability and growth through refreshed product offerings. In sync with its long-term growth objectives to streamline its product portfolio, Harley-Davidson will be focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with market trends. As an integral part of its Hardwire strategy, Harley-Davidson launched an online platform for its used motorcycles, namely HD-1, last year. The H-D1 marketplace platform is also set to fuel the company's prospects. The LiveWire unit—dedicated to e-bikes— will particularly help the company gain a solid foothold in a sportier market environment with its innovative and differentiated offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOG’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 7%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 4 cents over the past seven days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 5 cents over the past seven days.

To skip our detailed analysis of dividend investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Popular Investor Websites for Dividend Paying Stocks.Investing in dividend stocks can be a smart way to generate passive income and build long-term wealth. Dividend investing is a strategy that one must steadily implement over several years before one can begin seeing the fruits of their efforts. However, it's undeniable that investing in dividend stocks, like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is sure to yield attractive results if one does manage to stick with this strategy. Perhaps the most convincing evidence to substantiate this claim is the dividend income of Warren Buffett. According to Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual report, in 1994, the cash dividend Berkshire received from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was $75 million. By 2022, this dividend payment had increased to $704 million. This exponential and striking growth, observed every year since Berkshire bought its 400 million shares in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), seems too good to be true. But it is very much a reality, based on Berkshire's recent accounts.Another example of a successful dividend investment spearheaded by Buffett is Berkshire's stake in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). The firm bought its large stake in the company in 1995, when dividends it received from American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) were valued at $41 million. By 2022, this figure too had grown incredibly, amounting to $302 million. Buffett is highly optimistic about these companies even today, and he expects their cash dividends to keep growing as the years progress.Such profits can only be possible for dividend investors if they take their time to research the stocks they intend to invest in. There are a variety of investor websites available that can provide the information and resources needed to make informed decisions. These websites offer a wealth of data on individual stocks, including historical performance, dividend yields, and payout ratios, as well as analysis and commentary from financial experts and fellow investors. We have thus attempted to compile a list of some of the most popular investor websites for dividend stocks.Story continuesPopular Investor Websites for Dividend Paying StocksLet's now take a look at the 20 popular investor websites for dividend paying stocks.Our MethodologyFor this article, we first scoured dividend forums, online communities of dividend investors, YouTube, dividend threads on Reddit to find the most popular websites among dividend investors.

With this, American Express’s coverage in the UK would continue accelerating as leading businesses across home improvement, food-to-go and broader retail sectors are partnering with the company.AXP’s merchant acquiring business builds and manages relationships with merchants around the world who accept American Express cards. After signing new merchants to accept their cards, AXP generates revenue by charging them a fee or a discount rate, which is agreed upon beforehand. Discount revenues are the largest revenue source of the company and are likely to increase as more merchants join hands with AXP.As a growing number of merchants acknowledge the value of AXP’s loyal and high-spending consumer base, they stand to benefit from increased payment options made available to customers. Moreover, American Express would provide marketing and fraud-prevention solutions, data analytics and other services to merchants, improving their business position.Timpson, a family-owned retailer, now allows American Express cardholders to use their cards across 2000 stores in its portfolio. B&amp;M, a variety retailer, has also started accepting AXP’s cards to leverage its loyal customer base.Amex cards are now accepted at around 1000 food-to-go spots in petrol station forecourts and in outlets like Starbucks, Burger King and Subway, under a recent deal with EG Group. Along with these, AXP has also accelerated coverage across home improvement and charity shop sectors.The U.K. represents a significant portion of AXP’s billed business outside the United States. The total number of U.K. locations accepting Amex cards increased 30% year over year. The company would also implement its Shop Small campaign, under which it gives incentives and rewards to cardholders for spending in small businesses.The cardholders benefit from rewards and offers provided by AXP.

The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.HeidelbergCement AG and Martin Marietta are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that HDELY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HDELY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.63, while MLM has a forward P/E of 21.92. We also note that HDELY has a PEG ratio of 1.14. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MLM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.68.Another notable valuation metric for HDELY is its P/B ratio of 0.67. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

277,f5b4bdf9-7fed-3e5c-ac3d-621f62323a0a,MLM,2023-03-17,The 7 Best Infrastructure Stocks to Buy in March,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-infrastructure-stocks-buy-144915710.html,1678718955,STORY,"['GE', 'BIP', 'MLM', 'TMUS', 'VIE.PA', 'MTW']","[Two very powerful forces make infrastructure stocks very attractive at this point. One is the reshoring trend, which refers to American companies building more factories in the U.S. The other is the Bipartisan Infrastructure law, passed in November 2021, but is only starting to have a major impact on companies now. Given the convergence of these two powerful catalysts, this is a great time for long-term investors to find and pull the trigger on the best infrastructure stocks to buy.Many companies, including computer-chip makers, automakers, battery makers, and firms within the renewable-energy space, are building plants in the U.S. These factories, as CNBC’s Jim Lebenthal has pointed out, will boost infrastructure companies, both while the plants are being built and after they begin manufacturing products.For example, steelmakers and construction equipment makers will benefit from the building of these plants. At the same time, trucking companies and railroad operators will transport the factories’ finished products after the plants churn out products.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMeanwhile, thanks to the Bipartisan infrastructure law, the federal and state governments are pouring tens of billions of dollars into many types of infrastructure, including electricity, water development, broadband internet, and, of course, highways and bridges.TickerCompanyPriceMTWManitowoc$17.44GEGeneral Electric$90.13VEOEYVeolia Environment$28.58TMUST-Mobile$141.35MLMMartin Marietta$337.55CSXCSX$29.72BIPBrookfield Infrastructure Partners$32.48Manitowoc (MTW)Source: ShutterstockManitowoc (NYSE:MTW), a Wisconsin-based crane maker, delivered blowout fourth-quarter results and appeared to be a “poster child” for the infrastructure boom.The company’s fourth-quarter revenue surged 25% year-over-year to $621.5 million, coming in $56 million above analysts’ average estimate. Meanwhile, its EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared 50.6% YOY to $51.5 million.Story continuesAnd MTW’s financial results are poised to get even better in the longer term. The company’s CEO, Aaron Ravenscroft, said, “there are plenty of signs that a crane renaissance is on the horizon.” Among the positive catalysts for cranes are strong infrastructure spending in the U.S., China’s reopening, and higher commodity prices, he said.Further, Saudi Arabia has its own $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan, featuring “4,000 One World Trade centers that stretch 170 kilometers across the desert through the sea and into the mountains,” Ravenscroft noted. Finally, Europe is going to “eventually rebound” from its current slowdown caused by the Russia-Ukraine War, the CEO stated.Also worth noting is that Manitowoc is well-positioned to benefit from America’s onshoring trend, as thousands of cranes will be needed to build the dozens of factories being developed across America.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGE’s (NYSE:GE) electricity-oriented businesses, now known collectively as Vernova, will get a big boost from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Democrats’ anti-climate change law. Specifically, Vernova’s Grid business will be helped by the $10.5 billion that the Department of Energy plans to spend on enhancing the nation’s electric grid, while the unit’s Renewables business, which features a vibrant wind-turbine manufacturing operation, is going to be lifted by the tax credits for renewable energy that kicks in this year as a result of the anti-climate change law.In light of these powerful, positive catalysts, I’m hardly surprised that GE recently announced that it expects Vernova’s loss to fall between $200 million to $600 million this year from $1 billion in 2022. Moreover, GE predicts that the unit will be profitable in 2024, while its profit margin will climb to about 5% next year, up from -3.5% in 2022.Meanwhile, the investors who buy GE stock will also get exposure to the company’s Aerospace unit, which is generating spectacular financial results and is well-positioned to continue growing very rapidly for many years. Specifically, the company expects its commercial jet-engine business to grow at an impressive compound annual growth rate of around 13% between 2022 and 2025. Also noteworthy is that GE expects about 89% of its Aerospace revenue this year to come from providing services for airplanes, up from about 70% last year. That’s significant because servicing airplane engines tend to carry much higher profit margins than selling them.Despite the recent rally of GE stock, the shares are trading at a low trailing price-operating cash flow ratio of just 16.Veolia Environment (VEOEY)Veolia sign text and brand logo French company Environnement and supplier of water services in all worldSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comWith many regions of the globe, including the American Southwest, suffering from terrible droughts, desalination is by far the best and most comprehensive solution. That’s because the world has a virtually unlimited supply of seawater, while there are no other viable ways to obtain massive amounts of freshwater other than desalination.That’s why many governments, including those of California and Israel, have already embraced desalination on a broad scale, while Arizona is moving forward with its own massive $5.5 billion desalination plant.Veolia (OTCMKTS:VEOEY) reports that it desalinates water at over 2,300 locations worldwide, making it the world’s largest operator of desalination plants.In December, America’s Environmental Protection Agency reported, “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers more than $50 billion to EPA to improve our nation’s drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure.”Given some of the (overdone) concerns about desalination, I’m unsure if any of those funds will be used for desalination or end up in Veolia’s bank accounts. But in any event, Veolia will be a big beneficiary of the coming desalination boom.Indeed, the company is already posting very strong financial results, as its top line, excluding currency fluctuations, soared nearly 50% in 2022. Excluding currency fluctuations and acquisitions, its sales jumped 16%. Meanwhile, its EBITDA jumped 7.2%, excluding currency changes and acquisitions, to 6.2 billion euros.T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: ShutterstockT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has rolled out 5G Home Internet services, leaving it well-positioned to benefit tremendously from the $65 billion allocated by the Infrastructure Law to provide “high speed, reliable” internet access for “every American.”Additionally, TMUS is taking action on multiple fronts to exploit 5G technology to improve and expand its product portfolio. For example, the telecom company is partnering with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to provide companies with “customizable, private” 5G internet services. Among the services that T-Mobile will be able to offer companies as a result of the collaboration is “monitoring worker safety on remote industrial campuses, performing predictive maintenance on manufacturing equipment, or ensuring faster aircraft turnaround times at the airport.”And the company’s widely-used wireless networks are likely to be much easier to deploy and significantly more secure than Wi-Fi systems.Lastly, T-Mobile is widely recognized as having the nation’s best 5G network, leaving it well-positioned to offer consumers and businesses an array of impressive, highly reliable, very useful 5G services.Martin Marietta (MLM)a Martin Marietta (MLM) truckSource: ShutterstockMartin Marietta (NYSE:MLM) provides raw materials such as “crushed stone, sand, and gravel products,” along with ready-mixed concrete and asphalt to build roads, bridges, and factories. Moreover, MLM provides a type of lime that’s used to make steel.Given these points, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the huge amounts of money that America’s government is spending on roads, bridges, airports, and railroads. And, of course, MLM will get a big boost from the construction of many new factories in the U.S.Also noteworthy is that MLM’s exposure to the steel industry leaves it well-positioned to benefit from increased demand for automobiles and planes in the U.S. and many other countries.“Entering 2023, near-term product demand visibility is supported by healthy customer backlogs driven by an acceleration in public infrastructure investment and announced large-scale energy and domestic manufacturing projects,” MLM CEO Ward Nye said in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings press release.The company expects its EBITDA, excluding certain items, to climb from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion in 2023, up from $1.6 billion this year. In 2024, the company expects to benefit from the rejuvenation of the housing market.CSX (CSX)Look for New Highs From CSX Stock as the Economy Heats UpSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOne of the nation’s largest freight-railroad operators, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), is poised to benefit from increased demand for raw materials due to both the Infrastructure Law and the onshoring trend.Other possible drivers for CSX stock, according to investment bank Evercore ISI, are increasing demand for automobiles and higher coal prices. Moreover, the bank predicts that the company will benefit from strong demand for all of the offerings it transports, along with improving supply chains.Lauding CSX as having “the most efficient network service of the major U.S. rails,” the firm predicts that the railroad operator will be able to return a greater amount of capital to the owners of CSX stock going forward.Evercore has a $33 price target and a “buy” rating on the shares.For its part, Barclays, a British bank, expects railroad operators to benefit from reduced retail inventories, higher selling prices, “more normal seasonal shipping patterns,” stronger demand, and “easier comparisons” in the second half of the year.The firm kept an “overweight” rating on CSX.CSX stock has an undemanding forward price-earnings ratio of 16 times.Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)Brookfield Infrastructure logo on a phone screen in front of a blurred computer screen. BIPC stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockFew other large, very stable companies are as well-positioned to benefit from as many aspects of strong, current trends as Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP).BIP’s Utilities unit manages many systems that generate and transmit electricity, including tens of thousands of miles of “transmission and distribution lines” and “7.3 million electricity and natural gas connections.” The company also owns railroad tracks, natural gas pipelines, and “12,000 kilometers of fiber backbone.”Among the positive catalysts that could considerably lift BIP in the coming months and years are the electrification of transportation and the Infrastructure Law’s subsidies for internet coverage, railroad improvements, and enhancements of the electric grid.Also likely to boost BIP’s financial results, by virtue of its exposure to the rail sector, are increasing demand for raw materials as a result of the onshoring trend and higher demand for steel due to increased auto and plane production.Finally, since BIP also owns “50 data centers and and 2,100 active telecom towers,” it should get a big lift from the Internet of Things and the proliferation of 5G.In the third quarter of 2022, BIP’s funds from operations climbed 24% year-over-year to $525 million.BIP stock has a price-sales ratio of 1.1 and a hefty dividend yield of 4.7%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in GE.

The company’s interest in transmission projects and debt management will further drive its performance.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock faces risks due to strict licensing process, which may result in increased expenses and interest rates.TailwindsIDACORP’s cost management and focus on producing more electricity from clean sources are expected to benefit its earnings. The company expects a capex of $3.3 billion for the 2023-2027 period, primarily due to its reliability-focused projects. Its regulated electric operations in Idaho generate a relatively stable and growing income stream. In 2022, Idaho Power’s customer base improved 2.4%.

Since 2011, the company has raised its annual dividend by 163% to $3.16 per share.Consistent focus on cost control has enabled the company to keep its rates lower than other suppliers of electricity. The average industrial and residential rates charged by Idaho Power are much lower than the national average. Our model predicts a year-over-year increase in operating income of 1.4% and 6% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.IDACORP is involved in the Boardman-to-Hemingway (B2H) project — a 300-mile, 500-kilovolt (kV) transmission line between Boardman and Hemingway. This project, wherein IDACORP holds a 21% interest, is expected to mitigate transmission constraints and provide increased service reliability once it comes online. It is not expected to do so before 2026.Story continuesHeadwindsIDACORP’s performance could be adversely impacted due to strict regulatory environment, completion of projects within time and budget, and regulatory compliance costs.The demand for IDACORP’s services could be negatively impacted by the development of new electricity generating technology and decrease in cost of clean electricity generation from alternative energy sources. This is because the company primarily uses hydroelectric units to produce electricity.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are NiSource Inc.

As a result, the FDIC closed Silicon Valley Bank’s branches and offices for the weekend. While Silicon Valley Bank was expected to reopen on Monday, the turmoil was exacerbated when news broke Sunday that federal regulators had taken control over another bank, New York-based Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY). Regulators reclassified both banks as systemically important to ensure consumers’ deposits, but the damage was done. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (NYSEARCA:KRE) is down 23% in the past three trading days. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI have to admit that I did not see this coming. I’ve been a fan of SIVB for many years. I first wrote about it in 2012. In 2013, I included it on a list of the five best stocks to buy for the next 20 years. Through the end of 2021, it didn’t disappoint. Now, it’s nothing but a memory. Well, if you’re still on the hunt for bank stocks to buy after the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, the three below are using artificial intelligence to grow their businesses. Here’s hoping we don’t have any more bank runs. My bruised ego can’t take it.COFCapital One Financial $93.32JPMJPMorgan Chase $131.25RYRoyal Bank of Canada$95.62Capital One Financial (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comCapital One Financial (NYSE:COF) has been leveraging data analytics since it was founded as a credit card company in 1988. In November, Harvard University MBA student Anand Trivedi wrote an article about Capital One transforming traditional banking. Trivedi points out that the company appointed its first chief data officer in 2002, before other big banks. And Capital One launched its intelligent assistant, Eno, in 2017. According to Trivedi, it “was the banking industry’s first, natural language SMS chatbot that has evolved into a multichannel solution with numerous capabilities.” Story continuesWhile we take many modern banking conveniences for granted today, Trivedi notes that Eno “helps customers check their bank balances, track purchases, pay bills online, connect with spending, and proactively monitor their accounts and keep them secure.”Capital One continues to innovate. In fact, it made Fast Company’s 2023 Most Innovative Companies list in both the business services and travel and hospitality categories. “In June 2022, Capital One, the $35.5 billion (market cap) credit-card and financial services player, launched its own B2B software business to help other large companies use cloud and data management tools that have been a key part of Capital One’s own transformation into a cloud-based business,” wrote Fast Company’s Lydia Dishman.Specifically, Capital One partnered with cloud-based data platform provider Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) to create Slingshot to help clients manage Snowflake’s data. Dishman notes that Slingshot “enables teams to operate independently but with what it calls guardrails, managing workflows and how queries are structured in order to save time and money.”Capital One is helping its clients do better because it knows that will lead to increased business. In 2022, the company’s net revenue increased by 13% to $34.25 billion. JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comAlthough JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) recently curbed the use of ChatGPT by its employees, this is a precaution that it implements with all third-party software. The bank is a big believer in AI for its business. It uses AI and machine learning to deliver a better customer experience while making the bank more efficient.“Machine learning can improve everything we do here, so we want to do it responsibly,” Drew Cukor, JPMorgan’s head of AI/ML transformation and engagement, told MIT Technology Review in February. “We view responsible AI (RAI) as a critical component of our AI strategy.”The bank uses AI and other technological innovations to deliver better products for customers more quickly. It is doing this by leveraging the existing banking platform to create a new one that can process real-time data faster, enhancing the bank’s scale while allowing it to innovate. “We also see products that are going to take more advantage of intelligent uses of real-time data to react to the customer quickly, to provide insights to them in a real-time basis to make them have the most relevant data, to make the best experience decision for their lives,” Chad Ballard, JPMorgan’s head of global platform tech, consumer and community banking, told MIT Technology Review in March. So, not only is the bank using machine learning, AI and data analytics to create better products, it is using this technology to help its customers make better decisions about their financial situations. Ultimately, what’s good for the customer will be good for the bank, so put JPM on your list of bank stocks to buy on the dip.Royal Bank of Canada (RY)canadian flag over city to represent canadian stocksSource: ShutterstockRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) was one of the earliest North American banks to innovate through AI. In 2016, RBC created Borealis AI as the research and development arm of the bank. It collaborates and supports ongoing academic research into AI and machine learning. Today, Borealis AI is dedicated to “achieving state-of-the-art in machine learning” to help the bank responsibly develop better products for its customers. In November, RBC announced, in conjunction with Borealis AI, the launch of the Aiden Arrival algorithm to be used on the firm’s AI-based electronic trading platform. The algorithm was developed to “deliver a real-world AI solution to help improve trading results and insights for clients in a measurable and explainable way.”“When RBC Capital Markets brought Aiden platform to market for our clients, it was a big scientific milestone that demonstrated how a brand-new AI technology could succeed in extremely complex environments,” said Dr. Foteini Agrafioti, chief science officer at RBC and head of Borealis AI. The bank has a history of investing in AI and other new technologies.

One plan proposed a coalition of non-Ohio class action firms to take the lead, while the other would split leadership between national and Ohio-based attorneys.Under the first proposal, New York-based Jayne Conroy of Simmons Hanly Conroy, Colorado-based Seth Katz of Burg Simpson Eldredge Hersh Jardine, Delaware-based Elizabeth Graham of Grant &amp; Eisenhofer and Florida-based Michael Morgan of Morgan &amp; Morgan would serve as co-counsel, with several more national class action firms and Ohio firms in senior roles.Those attorneys said they have extensive experience working on complex litigation, and are ""dedicated to committing substantial economic and legal resources"" to represent the class.The competing coalition would be led by Boston-based Kristen Johnson and Seattle-based Steve Berman of national class action firm Hagens Berman alongside Cincinnati-based Ron Parry of Strauss Troy, with support from several other Ohio firms. The self-styled ""Team Ohio"" emphasized their proximity to local residents reeling from disaster and said their approach would help streamline the litigation.Residents and business owners in the lawsuits are seeking payment for property damage and to establish ongoing medical monitoring for any developing illness among residents within 30 miles of the crash site. The lawsuits raise a variety of claims against Norfolk Southern, including that the railroad was negligent and had created a nuisance for residents in the region.Story continuesThe state of Ohio also sued the company on Tuesday, claiming it “recklessly” endangered the health of Ohioans. The state is seeking prior and future costs tied to the derailment and has alleged violations of state laws regulating hazardous waste, solid waste and air and water pollution.Norfolk Southern has said it is working toward creating three long-term funds to benefit East Palestine, including one providing protection for homeowners against dipping property values, and another to protect drinking water.The company also said it supports a ""solution that addresses long-term health risks through the creation of a long-term medical compensation fund.""Pennsylvania officials said in February that they are investigating potential criminal charges.

To skip our detailed analysis of dividend investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Popular Investor Websites for Dividend Paying Stocks.Investing in dividend stocks can be a smart way to generate passive income and build long-term wealth. Dividend investing is a strategy that one must steadily implement over several years before one can begin seeing the fruits of their efforts. However, it's undeniable that investing in dividend stocks, like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is sure to yield attractive results if one does manage to stick with this strategy. Perhaps the most convincing evidence to substantiate this claim is the dividend income of Warren Buffett. According to Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual report, in 1994, the cash dividend Berkshire received from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was $75 million. By 2022, this dividend payment had increased to $704 million. This exponential and striking growth, observed every year since Berkshire bought its 400 million shares in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), seems too good to be true. But it is very much a reality, based on Berkshire's recent accounts.Another example of a successful dividend investment spearheaded by Buffett is Berkshire's stake in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). The firm bought its large stake in the company in 1995, when dividends it received from American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) were valued at $41 million. By 2022, this figure too had grown incredibly, amounting to $302 million. Buffett is highly optimistic about these companies even today, and he expects their cash dividends to keep growing as the years progress.Such profits can only be possible for dividend investors if they take their time to research the stocks they intend to invest in. There are a variety of investor websites available that can provide the information and resources needed to make informed decisions. These websites offer a wealth of data on individual stocks, including historical performance, dividend yields, and payout ratios, as well as analysis and commentary from financial experts and fellow investors. We have thus attempted to compile a list of some of the most popular investor websites for dividend stocks.Story continuesPopular Investor Websites for Dividend Paying StocksLet's now take a look at the 20 popular investor websites for dividend paying stocks.Our MethodologyFor this article, we first scoured dividend forums, online communities of dividend investors, YouTube, dividend threads on Reddit to find the most popular websites among dividend investors.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc.

Shares have added about 1.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Coke due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Coca-Cola Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates, Revenues BeatCoca-Cola has reported better-than-expected top-line results for fourth-quarter 2022, while the bottom line was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed our estimate in the quarter. The company’s results have benefited from the continued momentum in its business. KO has outlined its view for 2023.Comparable earnings of 45 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago period. Meanwhile, comparable earnings surpassed our estimate of 44 cents. However, unfavorable currency translations hurt comparable earnings by 11 percentage points. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share rose 11% year over year.Revenues of $10,125 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,005 million and improved 7% year over year. Revenues also beat our estimate of $9,603.7 million. Organic revenues rose 15% from the prior-year quarter. Coca-Cola’s top line benefited from strong revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales. Sales also benefited from a 1-point gain from one additional day in the quarter.In the reported quarter, Coca-Cola gained a global value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. The company benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels.Volume and PricingIn the reported quarter, concentrate sales advanced 2% year over year, while the price/mix rose 12%. The price/mix benefited from pricing actions in the marketplace across all operating segments, coupled with a favorable channel and package mix. Price/mix also gained from a positive segment mix. In the quarter, concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of the unit volume due to an additional day and the timing of concentrate shipments.Coca-Cola’s total unit case volume declined 1% in the fourth quarter, owing to the suspension of its business in Russia, which more than offset gains across Brazil, India, Great Britain and Mexico. Strength across all operating segments, ongoing investments in the marketplace and strength in the away-from-home channel were other positives. Volume for the developed markets improved in the low-single digits in the quarter, driven by strength across markets. Meanwhile, the developing and emerging markets declined in the low-single digits.Coming to the category cluster performance, volume growth was even for sparkling soft drinks, driven by even sales for the trademark Coca-Cola, 9% growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and a 2% decline in sparkling flavors. The sparkling soft drinks category benefited from the strong performances in Latin America and the Asia Pacific, offset by the suspension of business in Russia.Volume for nutrition, juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages declined 7% in the fourth quarter. The category was primarily hurt by the suspension of the business in Russia, offset by strong growth in developed markets.The water, sports, coffee and tea category were flat in the fourth quarter. Coca-Cola witnessed flat results for the water category as growth in Latin America was almost fully offset by declines in China, owing to the varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions. Sports drinks rose 1% due to solid performances in Latin America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Tea volume was down 9%, as gains in Fuze Tea in Latin America were negated by the softness in dogadan in Turkey. The coffee business witnessed 11% growth on the cycling impacts of the closure of Costa retail outlets in the U.K. in the prior year and the expansion of Costa coffee across markets.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRevenues rose 25% for Latin America, 14% for North America, 3% for the Asia Pacific and 4% for Bottling Investments, while the same declined 7% for EMEA and 5% for Global Ventures.Organic revenues improved 9% in EMEA, 32% in Latin America, 12% in North America, 15% in the Asia Pacific, 8% in Global Ventures and 16% in Bottling Investments.MarginsIn dollar terms, the operating income increased 24% year over year to $2,075 million, including a 10-point impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating income rose 10.9% year over year. Comparable currency-neutral operating income advanced 21% on strong organic revenue growth across all segments, offset by higher operating costs and marketing investments.The operating margin of 20.5% in the fourth quarter expanded 280 basis points (bps) from 17.7% in the prior-year quarter. The comparable operating margin expanded 60 bps to 22.7%, driven by higher operating revenues, offset by the impacts of the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, elevated marketing investments and currency headwinds.GuidanceManagement has outlined its view for 2023. It anticipates organic revenue growth of 7-8% for 2023. Comparable revenues are expected to be impacted by a 2-3% currency headwind based on current rates. The guidance includes a 1% negative impact of acquisition and divestiture.The company expects an impact of a mid-single-digit percentage from commodity price inflation on comparable cost of goods sold. The company anticipates an underlying effective tax rate of 19.5% for 2023.Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share are estimated to increase 7-9%. The company anticipates year-over-year comparable earnings per share growth of 4-5%. Its comparable earnings per share growth is likely to include a headwind of 3-4% from currency and a slight headwind from acquisitions and divestitures.For first-quarter 2023, comparable revenues are expected to include a 5-6% currency headwind and a 1% negative impact of acquisitions. Comparable earnings per share are estimated to include a currency headwind of 6-7%.Management envisions an adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion for 2023, including $11.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditure is likely to be $1.9 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Coke has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Coke has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCoke is part of the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry. Over the past month, PepsiCo (PEP), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.4%.

304,0fc728ee-0e38-30fa-b5bc-3fc13f4157b5,KO,2023-03-17,10 Best Stocks to Buy for Medium Term,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-medium-144952903.html,1678978192,STORY,"['HTLF', 'CNOBP', 'CVI', 'BHLB', 'CRK', 'KO', 'JNJ']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best stocks to buy for medium term. To skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Medium Term.While some investors prefer to hold long-term positions in the stocks they pile into, others take notice of company fundamentals and other factors to hold short-term positions in stocks. The practice of holding positions in stocks for a shorter time period before exiting them is known as medium-term trading. This strategy often enables investors to keep their portfolios active while cutting out stocks that perform poorly, so they can reinvest in better companies. It also maximizes investors' return on capital since profits from successful trades enable them to reinvest in stocks with higher growth potential.To successfully implement this strategy, investors must look at certain factors in the companies they choose. These include share performance over a 12-month period, company profits, sales, debt, price-to-earnings ratio, and dividends. It also helps to consider companies' revenue growth rates and payout ratios, in the case of dividend stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). With high revenue growth and low payout ratios, investors can actively ensure the companies they choose for medium-term trading are performing well and managing their earnings smartly in a way that enables their own growth while keeping shareholders satisfied.One major reason to consider dividend stocks for medium-term trading is that these stocks offer passive income to investors for the short period they hold a position in them. However, another reason to consider these stocks is that dividend-paying companies are an effective investment in times of market uncertainty. According to a Lord Abbett report published in July, dividend stocks have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index between 1973 and 2022. Research has shown that dividends have contributed to over 40% of the S&amp;P 500's total return between December 1929 and May 2022. Within these stocks, those that grow their dividends have markedly outperformed all other dividend stocks. And when it comes to periods when market returns are below average, dividends have been seen to provide a cushion for investors that offsets a stock's price depreciation. The research further indicates that in every decade where the market's annualized returns fell below 10%, dividends contributed about 76% of the S&amp;P 500's total return. Resultantly, dividend stocks have proven themselves to be attractive stock picks for investors in times of market volatility, which is why we have recommended dividend-paying companies in our list below.Story continues10 Best Stocks to Buy for Medium TermPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 10 best stocks to buy for medium term.Our MethodologyWe have selected dividend-paying stocks with payout ratios below 30% for our list below.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc.

Harberger Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, the Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index utilizes purpose-built economic models to normalize anonymized QuickBooks Online Payroll customer records against official government statistics. This represents the general population of small businesses in Canada, the United States and the U.K.Region wise, in Canada, the Intuit Index shows the number of people employed by small businesses with 1-19 employees in the previous month while for the United States, it shows that same with 1-9 employees in the previous month. In the U.K., the Index shows the number of job vacancies at small businesses with 1-9 employees in the previous month. In all the three regions, the Index captures any change in the number compared with the previous month using statistical methods.Intuit Inc. Price and Consensus Intuit Inc. Price and ConsensusIntuit Inc. price-consensus-chart | Intuit Inc. QuoteIn Canada, the data insights from the newly released Intuit Index are available at national, regional and sector levels, and are based on a total sample of almost 66,000 businesses. In the United States, the data insights are available at national, regional, state and sector levels, and are based on a total sample of almost 333,000 businesses. In the U.K., the data insights are available at the national (the U.K.), country (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) and sector levels, and are based on a total sample of almost 25,000 businesses. The data insights are seasonally adjusted to limit the effect of seasonal employment and hiring patterns throughout the year.The Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index will get published several days before the release of Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey and around two weeks before the Office for National Statistics’ monthly Vacancy Survey is released in the U.K. In the United States, its data insights are available up to nine months earlier than equivalent official statistics, delivering an enhanced small business employment snapshot of the region.Story continuesWith the latest release, Intuit intends to accelerate growth of small businesses and its success rates across Canada, the United States and the U.K. region. The Index is likely to serve as a decision-making tool for economists, policymakers and small businesses, providing them insights related to the number of small businesses, their employability and growth status across the regions.INTU is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help it generate stable revenues over the long run.In January, the company increased the availability of its QuickBooks Business Network solution among millions of small- and mid-market businesses in the United States. This is to enable eligible QuickBooks Online customers based in the United States to easily connect with each other in the business-to-business (B2B) network to accelerate B2B payments, leverage automation for simplification and streamlining administrative tasks, and get access to better collaboration and connection possibilities.In December 2022, the company entered an agreement to acquire financial health startup SeedFi. This will enable Intuit to accelerate and upscale its Credit Karma business members’ financial progress through SeedFi’s Credit Builder technology.Nevertheless, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small business operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth in the near term. Higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting the bottom line in the near term.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksIntuit currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

310,cfba78c3-8059-3baf-8481-64004d316c5d,SRE,2023-03-17,7 Stocks to Buy Now if the Fed Raises Rates,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-fed-210728034.html,1678741648,STORY,"['SRE', 'AWK', 'RSG', 'DG', 'PGR']","[Although it’s no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark interest rates, it may be an inevitability, thus sparking interest in stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Early last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left open the door for higher and quicker rate hikes. Essentially, economic data came in hotter than anticipated, leading to stubbornly high inflation. In Powell’s view, rising prices must be curbed to avoid long-term economic consequences.More recently, the U.S. economy added 311,000 jobs in February, outpacing expectations. Typically, countries aim for strong employment. However, too strong of a labor market implies more dollars chasing after fewer goods (i.e. inflation). Unfortunately, then, Powell may have little choice but to tighten the money supply. If that happens, investors can anticipate a significant impact to the equities sector, greatly affecting stocks to buy for rising interest rates. To stay ahead of the curve, investors may want to adjust their portfolios before the seemingly inevitable arrives. With that in mind, below are relevant stocks to buy for rising interest rates.PGRProgressive$139.53SRESempra Energy$143.97DGDollar General$216.80RSGRepublic Services$128.40AWKAmerican Water Works$136.37PSXPhillips 66$95.52KRKroger$46.85InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsProgressive (PGR)A photo of the Progressive logo on the side of a building.Source: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.comOn paper, rising interest rates should help insurance giant Progressive (NYSE:PGR). According to the Office of Financial Research, “[m]odestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry. When rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. With these new, higher-yielding corporate and other bond purchases, insurers’ investment earnings also increase.” However, that’s not the whole story. For instance, higher-than-expected claim costs may impair insurers’ earnings. Fortunately, that’s not the reason why I consider PGR one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Rather, I like Progressive because it cynically benefits from a captive audience. Put another way, you really can’t drive without a minimum level of insurance coverage.Story continuesTo be fair, PGR appears overvalued. That said, since the January opener, PGR gained 8% of its equity value. And in the trailing 365 days, it’s up over 33%. Why? Fundamentally, I believe investors recognize the coming influx of demand. As society normalizes and traffic level returns to and even exceeds pre-pandemic norms, traffic incidents will rise. Again, it’s cynical but here we are.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you want another dose of cynicism with your stocks to buy, look no further than utility firm Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). At the most basic level, Sempra and its ilk benefit from a concept called a natural monopoly. Because competing in the underlying industry requires overcoming a massive barrier to entry, most enterprises don’t even try. Therefore, Sempra stands largely alone in its market.And what a lucrative market it is. Covering swathes of Southern California, if you want to live in places like San Diego, you got to pay up. One of the beneficiaries happens to be Sempra Energy. Sure, people can always move out and relocate to, say, South Carolina. But for many Americans – and people across the globe – Southern California represents a “grail” region. Put another way, Sempra likely benefits from permanent relevance. That’s why I’m not as concerned about the less-than-ideal financials. Sempra doesn’t have the greatest stability in the balance sheet and its revenue growth is so-so. However, it’s consistently profitable, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Dollar General (DG)a figure of a shopper standing on top of a credit cardSource: ShutterstockFor the topic of stocks to buy for rising interest rates, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) practically sells itself. True, at the moment, the robust jobs market suggests that few consumers would consider shopping at dollar discount stores. However, with the Fed committed to tackling stubbornly elevated inflation, it’s almost inevitable that mass layoffs will materialize. At that point, DG would become extremely relevant.Further, with the banking sector suffering from sharp losses recently, we may have to put aside the idea of a soft landing. Indeed, we should be grateful for any landing that doesn’t involve heavy casualties. Still, somehow or another, the Fed will control inflation. That determination bodes poorly for the wider economy. However, it could be cynically beneficial for Dollar General.Also, DG enjoys several positive fiscal attributes. First, Gurufocus.com notes that DG is modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV). Objectively, the discount retailer enjoys a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 14.6%. As well, its net margin stands at 6.49%, outpacing 89% of the competition.Republic Services (RSG)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRWithout question, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) is one of the boring entries among stocks to buy for rising interest rates. As a waste disposal and management specialist, Republic doesn’t exactly offer a groundbreaking business. At the same time, it’s part of society’s infrastructure. During times of trouble, Republic may shine bright.That’s because no matter how advanced we become, someone has to take out the trash. While it might not be politically correct, you don’t see too many academic administrators encouraging their students to enter the waste disposal business. But again, someone has to do it; otherwise, the piling up of trash may cause severe health problems, among other concerns.Given the essential nature of the business, RSG easily ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Further, the company enjoys attractive financial metrics. Operationally, Republic’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, outpacing 61% of its peers. In addition, its net margin pings at 11%, above 72.35% of the industry.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company offers these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states, serving a population of roughly 14 million. Because of the steep barriers to entry, American Water benefits from a natural monopoly status.Cynically, then, AWK makes an excellent case for stocks to buy for rising interest rates. It’s possible that the Fed could take off the kiddie gloves, aggressively raising borrowing costs. In turn, we could see an acceleration in layoffs. However, skimping on core utility bills would be the last thing on households’ to-do lists. Beyond the “positive” narrative, AWK enjoys encouraging financial data. First, Gurufocus.com identifies AWK as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations. In terms of the bottom line, the company is consistently profitable. Over the trailing year, its net margin stands at 21.62%, above 87.61% of sector players.Phillips 66 (PSX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) also features a narrative for stocks to buy for rising interest rates that sells itself. For one thing, politicians can scream all they want about the electrification of mobility. Over the next several years, combustion-powered vehicles will remain relevant. Mainly, it comes down to cost as electric vehicles tend to be pricier than their combustion-powered counterparts.More importantly, society has started to normalize rapidly. We see that through a growing number of companies recalling their workers back to the office. Not only that, with layoffs – particularly in the high-paying tech space – also rising, employees can’t afford to confront their employees. Translation? Greater traffic volume on U.S. roadways.As I mentioned earlier, this dynamic should help Progressive. It will almost certainly help Phillips 66, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Lastly, Wall Street analysts believe in PSX, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $128.20, implying nearly 27% upside potential.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFor the last idea for stocks to buy for rising interest rates, I’m going with the obvious in grocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR). Obviously, humans require a minimum amount of calorie consumption; otherwise, things just don’t work well. Interestingly, KR represented one of the top performers last week, gaining nearly 3%. For the year, KR is up almost 6%.That’s significant because the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index only gained 1% on a year-to-date basis. Fundamentally, Kroger benefits from being on the lower rungs of the trade-down effect. In other words, when consumers face financial pressures, they’ll cut out discretionary spending first. This means frivolous categories such as premium fine-dining establishments stand at risk of revenue volume loss.With Kroger, people are unlikely to cut into spending there because not many cheaper alternatives exist. Further, the company benefits from certain positive financial metrics. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.3%, outflanking 76.68% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 8.6%. Not surprisingly, Kroger also enjoys a consistently profitable business. As pressures rise, you should consider KR as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 15.2% loss over the past four weeks.Agent-centered business model, improving premium, industry-leading margins, solid capital position and effective capital deployment poise it well for growth.Sustained solid operational performance at Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments poise CINF for long-term growth. Premium growth at Cincinnati Financial, one of the top 25 U.S. P&amp;C insurers, outperforms the industry average. Premium growth initiatives, price increases and a higher level of insured exposure should help it retain the momentum.The insurer targets a value creation ratio of 10% to 13% over the next five years. Sustained solid operational performance should help it achieve the target.This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.9%. Revenues are expected to be $2.07 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Cincinnati Financial, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc.

319,cfba78c3-8059-3baf-8481-64004d316c5d,PGR,2023-03-17,7 Stocks to Buy Now if the Fed Raises Rates,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-fed-210728034.html,1678741648,STORY,"['SRE', 'AWK', 'RSG', 'DG', 'PGR']","[Although it’s no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark interest rates, it may be an inevitability, thus sparking interest in stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Early last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left open the door for higher and quicker rate hikes. Essentially, economic data came in hotter than anticipated, leading to stubbornly high inflation. In Powell’s view, rising prices must be curbed to avoid long-term economic consequences.More recently, the U.S. economy added 311,000 jobs in February, outpacing expectations. Typically, countries aim for strong employment. However, too strong of a labor market implies more dollars chasing after fewer goods (i.e. inflation). Unfortunately, then, Powell may have little choice but to tighten the money supply. If that happens, investors can anticipate a significant impact to the equities sector, greatly affecting stocks to buy for rising interest rates. To stay ahead of the curve, investors may want to adjust their portfolios before the seemingly inevitable arrives. With that in mind, below are relevant stocks to buy for rising interest rates.PGRProgressive$139.53SRESempra Energy$143.97DGDollar General$216.80RSGRepublic Services$128.40AWKAmerican Water Works$136.37PSXPhillips 66$95.52KRKroger$46.85InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsProgressive (PGR)A photo of the Progressive logo on the side of a building.Source: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.comOn paper, rising interest rates should help insurance giant Progressive (NYSE:PGR). According to the Office of Financial Research, “[m]odestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry. When rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. With these new, higher-yielding corporate and other bond purchases, insurers’ investment earnings also increase.” However, that’s not the whole story. For instance, higher-than-expected claim costs may impair insurers’ earnings. Fortunately, that’s not the reason why I consider PGR one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Rather, I like Progressive because it cynically benefits from a captive audience. Put another way, you really can’t drive without a minimum level of insurance coverage.Story continuesTo be fair, PGR appears overvalued. That said, since the January opener, PGR gained 8% of its equity value. And in the trailing 365 days, it’s up over 33%. Why? Fundamentally, I believe investors recognize the coming influx of demand. As society normalizes and traffic level returns to and even exceeds pre-pandemic norms, traffic incidents will rise. Again, it’s cynical but here we are.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you want another dose of cynicism with your stocks to buy, look no further than utility firm Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). At the most basic level, Sempra and its ilk benefit from a concept called a natural monopoly. Because competing in the underlying industry requires overcoming a massive barrier to entry, most enterprises don’t even try. Therefore, Sempra stands largely alone in its market.And what a lucrative market it is. Covering swathes of Southern California, if you want to live in places like San Diego, you got to pay up. One of the beneficiaries happens to be Sempra Energy. Sure, people can always move out and relocate to, say, South Carolina. But for many Americans – and people across the globe – Southern California represents a “grail” region. Put another way, Sempra likely benefits from permanent relevance. That’s why I’m not as concerned about the less-than-ideal financials. Sempra doesn’t have the greatest stability in the balance sheet and its revenue growth is so-so. However, it’s consistently profitable, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Dollar General (DG)a figure of a shopper standing on top of a credit cardSource: ShutterstockFor the topic of stocks to buy for rising interest rates, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) practically sells itself. True, at the moment, the robust jobs market suggests that few consumers would consider shopping at dollar discount stores. However, with the Fed committed to tackling stubbornly elevated inflation, it’s almost inevitable that mass layoffs will materialize. At that point, DG would become extremely relevant.Further, with the banking sector suffering from sharp losses recently, we may have to put aside the idea of a soft landing. Indeed, we should be grateful for any landing that doesn’t involve heavy casualties. Still, somehow or another, the Fed will control inflation. That determination bodes poorly for the wider economy. However, it could be cynically beneficial for Dollar General.Also, DG enjoys several positive fiscal attributes. First, Gurufocus.com notes that DG is modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV). Objectively, the discount retailer enjoys a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 14.6%. As well, its net margin stands at 6.49%, outpacing 89% of the competition.Republic Services (RSG)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRWithout question, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) is one of the boring entries among stocks to buy for rising interest rates. As a waste disposal and management specialist, Republic doesn’t exactly offer a groundbreaking business. At the same time, it’s part of society’s infrastructure. During times of trouble, Republic may shine bright.That’s because no matter how advanced we become, someone has to take out the trash. While it might not be politically correct, you don’t see too many academic administrators encouraging their students to enter the waste disposal business. But again, someone has to do it; otherwise, the piling up of trash may cause severe health problems, among other concerns.Given the essential nature of the business, RSG easily ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Further, the company enjoys attractive financial metrics. Operationally, Republic’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, outpacing 61% of its peers. In addition, its net margin pings at 11%, above 72.35% of the industry.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company offers these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states, serving a population of roughly 14 million. Because of the steep barriers to entry, American Water benefits from a natural monopoly status.Cynically, then, AWK makes an excellent case for stocks to buy for rising interest rates. It’s possible that the Fed could take off the kiddie gloves, aggressively raising borrowing costs. In turn, we could see an acceleration in layoffs. However, skimping on core utility bills would be the last thing on households’ to-do lists. Beyond the “positive” narrative, AWK enjoys encouraging financial data. First, Gurufocus.com identifies AWK as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations. In terms of the bottom line, the company is consistently profitable. Over the trailing year, its net margin stands at 21.62%, above 87.61% of sector players.Phillips 66 (PSX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) also features a narrative for stocks to buy for rising interest rates that sells itself. For one thing, politicians can scream all they want about the electrification of mobility. Over the next several years, combustion-powered vehicles will remain relevant. Mainly, it comes down to cost as electric vehicles tend to be pricier than their combustion-powered counterparts.More importantly, society has started to normalize rapidly. We see that through a growing number of companies recalling their workers back to the office. Not only that, with layoffs – particularly in the high-paying tech space – also rising, employees can’t afford to confront their employees. Translation? Greater traffic volume on U.S. roadways.As I mentioned earlier, this dynamic should help Progressive. It will almost certainly help Phillips 66, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Lastly, Wall Street analysts believe in PSX, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $128.20, implying nearly 27% upside potential.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFor the last idea for stocks to buy for rising interest rates, I’m going with the obvious in grocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR). Obviously, humans require a minimum amount of calorie consumption; otherwise, things just don’t work well. Interestingly, KR represented one of the top performers last week, gaining nearly 3%. For the year, KR is up almost 6%.That’s significant because the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index only gained 1% on a year-to-date basis. Fundamentally, Kroger benefits from being on the lower rungs of the trade-down effect. In other words, when consumers face financial pressures, they’ll cut out discretionary spending first. This means frivolous categories such as premium fine-dining establishments stand at risk of revenue volume loss.With Kroger, people are unlikely to cut into spending there because not many cheaper alternatives exist. Further, the company benefits from certain positive financial metrics. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.3%, outflanking 76.68% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 8.6%. Not surprisingly, Kroger also enjoys a consistently profitable business. As pressures rise, you should consider KR as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Cedar received its first license from the province's energy regulator for approximately 8.5 kilometer pipeline that will connect the project to the Coastal GasLink pipeline.According to Pembina Pipeline, the project entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with ARC Resources Ltd., oil and gas producer, for 20 years of liquefaction services. They are currently working toward finalizing a supply agreement for 1.5 million tons of LNG per annum (MTPA).Cedar LNG is a collaboration between indigenous group Haisla Nation and Pembina Pipeline to build a floating LNG facility in Kitimat, British Columbia. It will have the capacity to export 3 MTPA of LNG.The majority of Cedar LNG Partners' shares is owned by Haisla Nation.George Heyman, the minister of environment and climate change strategy for the province of British Columbia, stated that the decision was carefully made after considering all environmental impacts and 16 legally binding conditions that Cedar must abide by throughout the project's duration. This would be in addition to other oil and gas emission control regulations that the government is developing.According to Terry Anderson, president and chief executive officer of ARC Resources, the deal marks a significant step in delivering low-cost, low-emission natural gas to significant demand markets.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -8.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has lost 10.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.62 per share, indicating a change of +186.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.37 points to a change of -16.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.57 indicates a change of -32% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $33.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.9%. The $148.89 billion and $136.62 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15.6% and -8.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $41.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $8.45 for the same period compares with $2.47 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.04%. The EPS surprise was +13.42%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is the company's eighth discovery in the region since 2019. The estimated volume is in the range of 24-84 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), with somewhat more oil than gas. The new well, Heisenberg, was dug by the Deepsea Stavanger drilling rig. Equinor is the operator of this discovery and DNO is an associate.The discovery is considered commercially viable, partially because it can use the existing infrastructure related to the Troll B platform. The parties are thinking of drilling an appraisal well in 2024, since a more accurate assessment of its size is necessary to determine the volumes that can be recovered.According to Geir Sortveit, senior vice president for exploration and production west at Equinor, discoveries in eight out of nine exploration wells at Troll have helped the company in achieving a 90% success rate.He added that the company plans to further explore the region, while finding potential development solutions for its recent discoveries. Sortveit also said that the company has good infrastructure in the area and can quickly send competitive barrels from here to the market at low cost and with minimal CO2 emissions.Five of the eight discoveries were made in licenses awarded through APA rounds. It has just been over a month since Equinor, together with its partners, has made the Røver South discovery in the same area. Two weeks ago, the company boosted its ownership holdings in four of the regional discoveries through acquisitions.Going forward, EQNR plans to drill 20 to 30 exploratory wells every year. Exploration is key to preserving the Norwegian continental shelf's cash flow and providing the requisite gas volumes for the development of a blue hydrogen value chain. In order to maximize returns on its 50 years of investment, EQNR will conduct volumetric exploration in mature regions where new finds can be tied into the existing infrastructure.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Equinor ASA carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out the 5 Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the World.According to Allied Market Research, the size of the global healthcare insurance industry stood at $1.98 trillion at the end of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased demand for health insurance around the world. The size of the industry is expected to compound annually at an average rate of 9.7% to reach $4.15 trillion by 2028. People consider health insurance services as an integral tool to share medical costs during accidents, illnesses, and injuries. The impact of the delay in routine healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic played favorably for health insurance companies. However, this effect was also offset by the increase in demand for COVID-19-related testing and treatment claims.The Protection Gap: Addressing Economic Losses in Health Insurance and BeyondExperts believe that health insurance companies that can innovate and transform their offerings according to customers' demands will be able to grow during these uncertain times. The uncertainty related to geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook has made business stability the top priority amongst health insurance companies such as Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV).In addition, the protection gap is growing with every passing day as the insurance related to natural disasters, cyber attacks, and health, only partially covers the actual economic losses related to these events. For instance, in 2019, more than 400 natural disaster events resulted in an economic loss of $232 billion, but only $71 billion of the loss was insured. This gap is expected to increase as the global population and life expectancy rise. These factors would provide the health insurance industry with a bigger market to target.Story continuesAccording to the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry could increase its bottom line by $60 - $80 billion annually if it works on reducing the insurance protection gaps. As of 2021, the global insurance protection gap stood at $1.4 trillion, while the global health protection gap was estimated at $737 billion. Experts believe the higher government spending on healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic helped reduce the health protection gap; however, it is expected to increase again as the pandemic has eased and governments around the world are shifting their focus towards other activities. Experts also highlight the low level of insurance literacy as a major challenge in gaining widespread market penetration. According to research conducted by French insurer SCOR, a significant number of people do not purchase insurance because they cannot comprehend the terms and conditions. The study comprised 12,000 consumers from around the world. Governments, regulators, insurance companies, and employers must come together to address the challenges to boost the adoption of health insurance.12 Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the Worldnational-cancer-institute-GcrSgHDrniY-unsplashOur MethodologyWe carried out thorough research utilizing a variety of dependable sources, including company and industry reports and financial databases, to determine the largest health insurance companies in the world. We took into account pertinent aspects, like the company's consumer base, product offerings, business models, and global reach, to assess its scale of operations. The companies have been ranked in ascending order of their trailing twelve months (ttm) revenue. The list includes both private and public limited companies.Biggest Health Insurance Companies in the World12. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)TTM Total Revenue:  $68.95 billion  MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is a New York-based provider of annuities, employee benefit programs, and insurance. The company provides a wide range of health insurance products like accident insurance, disability and absence services, hospital indemnity, critical illness, and cancer insurance.In a research note issued on January 6, Jimmy Bhullar at JPMorgan increased the target price for MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) from $77 to $80 and maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. The analyst anticipates the company’s life and health insurance segment to perform well in 2023 as the benchmark interest rates are expected to rise further. However, this could be offset by a weak economy that could dent demand along with a higher risk of credit losses.11. Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in München (MUV2.DE)TTM Total Revenue: $71.50 billion (€67.09 billion)Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in München (MUV2.DE), more commonly known as Munich Re Group, is a German insurance company established in 1880. The company provides a wide variety of reinsurance products related to healthcare.Munich Re has established an ambitious roadmap for the next five years called the Munich Re Group Ambition 2025. While preserving and reinforcing the core of its business model, the company aims to drive the transition towards new business models. The company plans to enhance its market position in Germany and achieve profitable growth in international business, B2B operations, and direct customer offerings.10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) [ Owner of Aetna]TTM Total Revenue (Aetna):  $82.2 billion CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based healthcare company that is also a provider of health insurance services.The company acquired Aetna in 2018 to expand its presence in the health insurance segment. Based on 2021 total health plan enrollments, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) secured the sixth position with 2,574,348 enrollments. In a note issued to investors on February 9, Brian Tanquilut at Jefferies increased the target price for CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) from $130 to $143 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock following the strong Q4 2022 results. The company also disclosed that it intends to acquire Chicago, Illinois-based healthcare company Oak Street Health, Inc. (NYSE:OSH) for a sum of $10.6 billion. The analyst anticipates the earnings from Oak Street to contribute towards the company’s bottom-line growth after 2024.Vltava Fund shared its outlook on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”10. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)TTM Total Revenue:  $92.87 billion Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based health insurance company founded in 1961.The corporation occupies the 114th position on the 2023 America's Best Large Employers list curated by Forbes. Furthermore, based on the total health plan enrollment data for 2021 compiled by Forbes, Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is the 11th biggest health insurance company in the US, with an enrollment of 887,612 members. Following the Q4 2022 results, George Hill at Deutsche Bank assigned Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) stock a target price of $562 along with a Buy rating on February 28. The analyst highlighted the company’s decision to exit the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business company. The business segment included the Federal Employee health benefit plans and rewards programs that are fully insured and self-funded.Here's what Renaissance Investment Management said about Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In September, We added a new position in the Health Care sector with Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), one of the largest managed care providers in the U.S. with a focus on medical insurance for the Medicare Advantage market. We believe Humana is poised to see a reacceleration in Medicare Advantage membership growth after making large investments in its program benefits earlier this year. In addition, we like the demographic tailwinds for the entire Medicare Advantage market, as the next four years should provide the highest number of baby boomers yet qualifying for Medicare benefits.”9. Kaiser PermanenteTTM Total Revenue:  $95.4 billion Kaiser Permanente is an Oakland, California-based healthcare organization founded in 1945.The company provides a variety of healthcare services, including health insurance, to individuals and families.

(NYSE:EL) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-110130290.html,1679050890,STORY,['EL'],"[Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) has had a rough month with its share price down 6.8%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Estée Lauder Companies'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:22% = US$1.5b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Estée Lauder Companies' Earnings Growth And 22% ROETo begin with, Estée Lauder Companies has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Estée Lauder Companies over the past five years. growthNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Estée Lauder Companies' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 24% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Estée Lauder Companies is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Estée Lauder Companies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Estée Lauder Companies has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 39% (or a retention ratio of 61%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, Estée Lauder Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 36%. Still, forecasts suggest that Estée Lauder Companies' future ROE will rise to 57% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Estée Lauder Companies' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

To skip our detailed analysis of dividend investing, you can go directly to see the 5 Popular Investor Websites for Dividend Paying Stocks.Investing in dividend stocks can be a smart way to generate passive income and build long-term wealth. Dividend investing is a strategy that one must steadily implement over several years before one can begin seeing the fruits of their efforts. However, it's undeniable that investing in dividend stocks, like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), is sure to yield attractive results if one does manage to stick with this strategy. Perhaps the most convincing evidence to substantiate this claim is the dividend income of Warren Buffett. According to Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual report, in 1994, the cash dividend Berkshire received from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was $75 million. By 2022, this dividend payment had increased to $704 million. This exponential and striking growth, observed every year since Berkshire bought its 400 million shares in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), seems too good to be true. But it is very much a reality, based on Berkshire's recent accounts.Another example of a successful dividend investment spearheaded by Buffett is Berkshire's stake in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). The firm bought its large stake in the company in 1995, when dividends it received from American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) were valued at $41 million. By 2022, this figure too had grown incredibly, amounting to $302 million. Buffett is highly optimistic about these companies even today, and he expects their cash dividends to keep growing as the years progress.Such profits can only be possible for dividend investors if they take their time to research the stocks they intend to invest in. There are a variety of investor websites available that can provide the information and resources needed to make informed decisions. These websites offer a wealth of data on individual stocks, including historical performance, dividend yields, and payout ratios, as well as analysis and commentary from financial experts and fellow investors. We have thus attempted to compile a list of some of the most popular investor websites for dividend stocks.Story continuesPopular Investor Websites for Dividend Paying StocksLet's now take a look at the 20 popular investor websites for dividend paying stocks.Our MethodologyFor this article, we first scoured dividend forums, online communities of dividend investors, YouTube, dividend threads on Reddit to find the most popular websites among dividend investors.

If you want to see more best US stocks for foreigners, go directly to 5 Best US Stocks for Foreigners.Given the United States has the largest economy in the world, many foreigners invest in American stocks. Furthermore, many leading American companies are multinational, giving further geographic exposure and scale.The United States is also the home to the Federal Reserve, which is the world's leading central bank. Furthermore, it is home to Wall Street, which is the world's leading financial center.Although it is already one of the most developed countries in the world, the United States has a lot of growth potential in the future.For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.The United States has substantial population growth potential.The United States leads in AI which could help produce many innovative breakthroughs that increase domestic and potentially world GDP.Many multinational American companies also have substantial emerging market operations that could help with earnings growth in the future.Many leading American blue chips also pay a dividend and also buy back stock when they have excess capital.Near Term HeadwindsThe American economy is slowing currently.Recently, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank by assets in the country, failed in a few days given the bank failed to successfully raise enough equity that it needed and customers withdrew substantial deposits.Fearing contagion, the U.S. government stepped in to protect deposits at Silicon Valley Bank.CNBC said, ""Banking regulators devised a plan Sunday to backstop depositors with money at Silicon Valley Bank, a critical step in stemming a feared systemic panic brought on by the collapse of the tech-focused institution.""Although the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank are protected, the equity shareholders of the bank aren't and the failure worsened confidence in other banks, which could have ripple effects on U.S. economic growth.Story continuesWith the failure and the higher interest rates, there is potential for the U.S. economy to slow even further and as a result, the near term is pretty uncertain in the United States. Furthermore, if the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of stocks purchased in U.S. dollars could decrease, all else equal.Despite the near term headwinds which could lead to lower stock prices if economic data fails to meet expectations, the long term potential growth of leading blue chips in the United States is still pretty attractive. The United States has the world's leading economy, leads the world in innovation currently, and will likely remain the world's innovation leader in the future. With more innovation, there could be more total value created and many of today's leading blue chips in America could benefit as a result.For those of you interested check out 12 Most Promising Future Stocks to Buy.Given individual companies can fail as Silicon Valley Bank showed and sectors can also underperform, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real Estate, InvestmentPhoto by Frans Ruiter on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners, we picked 15 stocks with competitive advantages that have headquarters in the United States and that are listed in either the NYSE or the NASDAQ.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners15.

(NYSE:GS) ranks #9 on our list of 15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners given 74 hedge funds in our database owned shares of the leading investment bank at the end of Q4.

To skip our detailed analysis of ChatGPT and developments in artificial intelligence, you can go directly to see the 5 Stocks ChatGPT Says Will Make Me Rich in 10 Years.One of the biggest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) seen so far is the emergence of ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots. ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI, an AI research and deployment company. The chatbot uses deep learning techniques to generate responses to text inputs in the form of a conversation with the user. Ever since its release, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, making researchers, users, and even investors even more curious about the artificial intelligence sector and what it has to offer.AI was first deployed in the finance sector years ago, but the speed of its incorporation in the sector was sped up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, it is expected that AI in finance will drive competitive advantages for financial firms. According to a report published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2021, AI can improve firms' efficiency through cost reduction and productivity enhancement, leading to higher profitability. It can also enhance the quality of financial services and products. Because of the benefits AI offers to the financial sector, global spending on AI in the private sector has been steadily increasing. Between 2020 and 2024, spending on AI was forecast to rise from $50.1 billion in 2020 to over $110 billion in 2024.Picking Stocks Using AIA recent example of AI deployment in the finance sector can be found in the ETF arena. According to a Bloomberg article published in January, the AI Powered Equity ETF is a $102 million ETF that managed to return about 9.9% in January 2023, while the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index returned a mere 4.7%. The ETF uses a quantitative model to assess over 6,000 American publicly-traded companies. Even before this more recent development, AI deployment was seen in the finance sector. A BarclayHedge Hedge Fund Sentiment Survey conducted in 2018 found that 56% of hedge fund respondents had used AI to inform their investment decisions. Hedge funds have been using AI to analyze data and forecast market movements for tactical asset allocation for years now. Some hedge funds known to use machine learning and AI algorithms in their business include Cerebellum Capital, Aidiya Holdings, and Taaffeite Capital Management.Story continuesThe AI RaceApart from the finance sector, public companies in the tech sector, such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have also been joining the AI frenzy to keep up with changing trends. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), for instance, has begun incorporating generative AI technology in its Bing search engine. In competition, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also announced plans to integrate the same technology into its own search engine. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has also been working with generative AI, attributing its increasing business to consumer demand for this technology in their networks. According to the Wall Street Journal in an article published this March, Broadcom Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO, Hock Tan, expects sales from the company's Ethernet switch products deployed for AI uses to exceed $800 million in 2023, compared to $200 million in 2022. Tan also commented that the company's revenues from its compute offload accelerated business will also hit $3 billion in the fiscal year of 2023, compared to $2 billion the year before.Additionally, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is not alone in its attempts to capitalize on the recent AI boom. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), another chip maker, has also recently announced the rise of a new business aiming to provide greater access to AI software tools. These are merely a few examples of how companies across the globe, public and private, are swept away by the AI craze. With ChatGPT being one of the primary reasons behind this, we have attempted to use this AI chatbot to generate a list of profitable stocks to invest in to see just how far AI has advanced.Photo by Levart_Photographer on UnsplashLet's now take a look at 10 stocks ChatGPT says will make me rich in 10 years.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks in our list below, we used several prompts on ChatGPT to make the AI language model provide us with a list of 10 stocks that it thinks can make investors rich in 10 years. We asked ChatGPT to think of itself as a professional stock analyst, and consider all information available to it to come up with this list. After that, we ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

That is much farther apart than planes in several recent close calls.In its preliminary report, the safety board did not state a cause for the Feb. 16 incident, but it said it formed a group to investigate air traffic controller actions. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and the Federal Aviation Administration, which hires and trains controllers, are taking part in the investigation, the NTSB said.The early findings came a day after officials from the NTSB, the FAA, airlines and airline unions met outside Washington, D.C., for a “safety summit.""According to an FAA readout of summit sessions that were closed to the public and press, a group that discussed air traffic recommended closer examination of data to find the causes and solutions for planes being on or near the same runway at the same time. The FAA said it asked industry to find technology to help air traffic controllers track equipment on the ground.The NTSB is investigating six recent events involving conflicting runway use. The board did not start any similar investigations in 2022 and only two in 2021, according to a spokesman.Overall runway incursions, as they are called, are lower in the last six months than the same period last year, according to FAA figures, but those include the vast majority of incidents that are deemed low- or no-risk.In Sarasota, a controller cleared the American Airlines flight to land on runway 14 when the plane was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the airport. When it was about 3 miles (5 kilometers) out, the controller cleared the Air Canada Rouge plane to take off from the same runway.The American crew elected to cancel their landing, turn to the right and return to land.

Both are life insurance operating companies of Principal Financial Group, Inc. (PFG) [NASDAQ: PFG] and collectively are referred to as Principal. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICRs of ""a"" (Excellent) of Principal Financial Services, Inc. and PFG, as well as the group’s Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. AM Best also has affirmed the group’s Short-Term Issue Credit Rating (Short-Term IR). (Please see below for a detailed listing of the Long- and Short-Term IRs.) All companies are headquartered in Des Moines, IA.The ratings reflect Principal’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management.AM Best views Principal’s risk-adjusted capitalization as very strong, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), although capital growth has been limited by dividends to the parent company. The company has lowered its product risk with divestitures in 2022 of retail fixed annuity and universal life insurance with secondary guarantee (ULSG) blocks. The balance sheet strength assessment also benefits from historically favorable financial flexibility, liquidity profiles and access to capital markets at the holding company level. AM Best’s view of the company’s capital is somewhat tempered by Principal’s higher allocations to commercial mortgages in comparison with the group’s peers and usage of its captive reinsurers.The company continues to report favorable growth trends and profitability metrics, benefiting from its diverse lines of business, distribution channels and leading market positions. An increasing presence internationally provides additional earnings diversity. However, AM Best notes that political and macroeconomic risks in Principal’s key international markets could have negative effects on the holding company going forward.Story continuesPrincipal has demonstrated strong risk management capabilities through continued enhancements to its risk modeling and stress-testing capabilities to support its overall business strategy, which have driven recent major business decisions.

Courtesy of solid prospects, this presently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is worth adding to your portfolio now.Aflac — with a market cap of $38.6 billion — operates as a supplemental health and life insurance products provider. It has strong footprints in the United States and Japan. Based in Columbus, GA, AFL is likely to benefit from the high interest rate environment. Shares of AFL have climbed only 1.4% in the past six months and are expected to rise further in the coming days.The Trend in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFL’s current-year earnings is pegged at $5.59 per share, which has witnessed seven upward estimate revisions in the past 60 days against none in the opposite direction. The estimate rose 3.3% during this period. Aflac beat on earnings in all the last four quarters, the average being 5.9%.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseAflac Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues is $18.5 billion. Aflac anticipates improved sales within its Aflac Japan segment this year due to improved pandemic conditions, product launches and product updates.Key DriversAFL’s U.S. segment witnessed a 16.9% increase in sales in 2021 and 16.1% year over year in 2022, courtesy of growth investments and productivity gains, marking an impressive trend. The U.S. business is expected to build on that momentum with the help of its acquired platforms like dental network and vision and group life and disability. Aflac’s strategic moves to expand its product suite in the U.S. segment are praiseworthy.Product innovations and updating, the development of virtual sales channels, increased face-to-face interactions and the recruitment of productive agents are likely to drive the U.S. business’ sales, going forward. Despite witnessing a slow start last year, the company’s Japan business gained momentum toward the end. A cancer product launch is helping the unit in this regard. Also, the benefit ratio of the business normalized toward the end of last year, positioning the company for growth for this year.Story continuesThe company’s benefit ratio, which measures the amount paid in claims as a percentage of premium, is expected to improve in 2023. Our estimate suggests the metric to stay close to 58% in 2023, indicating an improvement from last year’s 60%, aiding its margins. Its cost-saving initiatives will drive the bottom line. Keeping a more agile workforce will likely increase the company’s efficiency over the medium to long term.Aflac’s balance sheet strength enables the company to take shareholder value boosting measures. Last year, the company bought back 39.2 million shares for $2.4 billion. At the year-end, it had 116.6 million shares authorized for buybacks left. Management has also announced dividends of 42 cents per share for the first quarter of 2023, marking a 5% increase.A RiskThere is a factor that investors should keep a careful eye on.Aflac’s net cash from operations declined 15.2% in 2021 and 23.2% in 2023. In the last five years, the company witnessed declines in net cash from operations four times. The continuation of this trend can impact future operations. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are Arthur J.

339,cfba78c3-8059-3baf-8481-64004d316c5d,AWK,2023-03-17,7 Stocks to Buy Now if the Fed Raises Rates,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-fed-210728034.html,1678741648,STORY,"['SRE', 'AWK', 'RSG', 'DG', 'PGR']","[Although it’s no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark interest rates, it may be an inevitability, thus sparking interest in stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Early last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left open the door for higher and quicker rate hikes. Essentially, economic data came in hotter than anticipated, leading to stubbornly high inflation. In Powell’s view, rising prices must be curbed to avoid long-term economic consequences.More recently, the U.S. economy added 311,000 jobs in February, outpacing expectations. Typically, countries aim for strong employment. However, too strong of a labor market implies more dollars chasing after fewer goods (i.e. inflation). Unfortunately, then, Powell may have little choice but to tighten the money supply. If that happens, investors can anticipate a significant impact to the equities sector, greatly affecting stocks to buy for rising interest rates. To stay ahead of the curve, investors may want to adjust their portfolios before the seemingly inevitable arrives. With that in mind, below are relevant stocks to buy for rising interest rates.PGRProgressive$139.53SRESempra Energy$143.97DGDollar General$216.80RSGRepublic Services$128.40AWKAmerican Water Works$136.37PSXPhillips 66$95.52KRKroger$46.85InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsProgressive (PGR)A photo of the Progressive logo on the side of a building.Source: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.comOn paper, rising interest rates should help insurance giant Progressive (NYSE:PGR). According to the Office of Financial Research, “[m]odestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry. When rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. With these new, higher-yielding corporate and other bond purchases, insurers’ investment earnings also increase.” However, that’s not the whole story. For instance, higher-than-expected claim costs may impair insurers’ earnings. Fortunately, that’s not the reason why I consider PGR one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Rather, I like Progressive because it cynically benefits from a captive audience. Put another way, you really can’t drive without a minimum level of insurance coverage.Story continuesTo be fair, PGR appears overvalued. That said, since the January opener, PGR gained 8% of its equity value. And in the trailing 365 days, it’s up over 33%. Why? Fundamentally, I believe investors recognize the coming influx of demand. As society normalizes and traffic level returns to and even exceeds pre-pandemic norms, traffic incidents will rise. Again, it’s cynical but here we are.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comIf you want another dose of cynicism with your stocks to buy, look no further than utility firm Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). At the most basic level, Sempra and its ilk benefit from a concept called a natural monopoly. Because competing in the underlying industry requires overcoming a massive barrier to entry, most enterprises don’t even try. Therefore, Sempra stands largely alone in its market.And what a lucrative market it is. Covering swathes of Southern California, if you want to live in places like San Diego, you got to pay up. One of the beneficiaries happens to be Sempra Energy. Sure, people can always move out and relocate to, say, South Carolina. But for many Americans – and people across the globe – Southern California represents a “grail” region. Put another way, Sempra likely benefits from permanent relevance. That’s why I’m not as concerned about the less-than-ideal financials. Sempra doesn’t have the greatest stability in the balance sheet and its revenue growth is so-so. However, it’s consistently profitable, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.Dollar General (DG)a figure of a shopper standing on top of a credit cardSource: ShutterstockFor the topic of stocks to buy for rising interest rates, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) practically sells itself. True, at the moment, the robust jobs market suggests that few consumers would consider shopping at dollar discount stores. However, with the Fed committed to tackling stubbornly elevated inflation, it’s almost inevitable that mass layoffs will materialize. At that point, DG would become extremely relevant.Further, with the banking sector suffering from sharp losses recently, we may have to put aside the idea of a soft landing. Indeed, we should be grateful for any landing that doesn’t involve heavy casualties. Still, somehow or another, the Fed will control inflation. That determination bodes poorly for the wider economy. However, it could be cynically beneficial for Dollar General.Also, DG enjoys several positive fiscal attributes. First, Gurufocus.com notes that DG is modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV). Objectively, the discount retailer enjoys a strong three-year revenue growth rate of 14.6%. As well, its net margin stands at 6.49%, outpacing 89% of the competition.Republic Services (RSG)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRWithout question, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) is one of the boring entries among stocks to buy for rising interest rates. As a waste disposal and management specialist, Republic doesn’t exactly offer a groundbreaking business. At the same time, it’s part of society’s infrastructure. During times of trouble, Republic may shine bright.That’s because no matter how advanced we become, someone has to take out the trash. While it might not be politically correct, you don’t see too many academic administrators encouraging their students to enter the waste disposal business. But again, someone has to do it; otherwise, the piling up of trash may cause severe health problems, among other concerns.Given the essential nature of the business, RSG easily ranks among the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Further, the company enjoys attractive financial metrics. Operationally, Republic’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, outpacing 61% of its peers. In addition, its net margin pings at 11%, above 72.35% of the industry.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company offers these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states, serving a population of roughly 14 million. Because of the steep barriers to entry, American Water benefits from a natural monopoly status.Cynically, then, AWK makes an excellent case for stocks to buy for rising interest rates. It’s possible that the Fed could take off the kiddie gloves, aggressively raising borrowing costs. In turn, we could see an acceleration in layoffs. However, skimping on core utility bills would be the last thing on households’ to-do lists. Beyond the “positive” narrative, AWK enjoys encouraging financial data. First, Gurufocus.com identifies AWK as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary FMV calculations. In terms of the bottom line, the company is consistently profitable. Over the trailing year, its net margin stands at 21.62%, above 87.61% of sector players.Phillips 66 (PSX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) also features a narrative for stocks to buy for rising interest rates that sells itself. For one thing, politicians can scream all they want about the electrification of mobility. Over the next several years, combustion-powered vehicles will remain relevant. Mainly, it comes down to cost as electric vehicles tend to be pricier than their combustion-powered counterparts.More importantly, society has started to normalize rapidly. We see that through a growing number of companies recalling their workers back to the office. Not only that, with layoffs – particularly in the high-paying tech space – also rising, employees can’t afford to confront their employees. Translation? Greater traffic volume on U.S. roadways.As I mentioned earlier, this dynamic should help Progressive. It will almost certainly help Phillips 66, making it one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates. Lastly, Wall Street analysts believe in PSX, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $128.20, implying nearly 27% upside potential.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFor the last idea for stocks to buy for rising interest rates, I’m going with the obvious in grocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR). Obviously, humans require a minimum amount of calorie consumption; otherwise, things just don’t work well. Interestingly, KR represented one of the top performers last week, gaining nearly 3%. For the year, KR is up almost 6%.That’s significant because the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index only gained 1% on a year-to-date basis. Fundamentally, Kroger benefits from being on the lower rungs of the trade-down effect. In other words, when consumers face financial pressures, they’ll cut out discretionary spending first. This means frivolous categories such as premium fine-dining establishments stand at risk of revenue volume loss.With Kroger, people are unlikely to cut into spending there because not many cheaper alternatives exist. Further, the company benefits from certain positive financial metrics. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.3%, outflanking 76.68% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 8.6%. Not surprisingly, Kroger also enjoys a consistently profitable business. As pressures rise, you should consider KR as one of the stocks to buy for rising interest rates.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Shares have added about 1.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Coke due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Coca-Cola Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates, Revenues BeatCoca-Cola has reported better-than-expected top-line results for fourth-quarter 2022, while the bottom line was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed our estimate in the quarter. The company’s results have benefited from the continued momentum in its business. KO has outlined its view for 2023.Comparable earnings of 45 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago period. Meanwhile, comparable earnings surpassed our estimate of 44 cents. However, unfavorable currency translations hurt comparable earnings by 11 percentage points. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share rose 11% year over year.Revenues of $10,125 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,005 million and improved 7% year over year. Revenues also beat our estimate of $9,603.7 million. Organic revenues rose 15% from the prior-year quarter. Coca-Cola’s top line benefited from strong revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales. Sales also benefited from a 1-point gain from one additional day in the quarter.In the reported quarter, Coca-Cola gained a global value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. The company benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels.Volume and PricingIn the reported quarter, concentrate sales advanced 2% year over year, while the price/mix rose 12%. The price/mix benefited from pricing actions in the marketplace across all operating segments, coupled with a favorable channel and package mix. Price/mix also gained from a positive segment mix. In the quarter, concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of the unit volume due to an additional day and the timing of concentrate shipments.Coca-Cola’s total unit case volume declined 1% in the fourth quarter, owing to the suspension of its business in Russia, which more than offset gains across Brazil, India, Great Britain and Mexico. Strength across all operating segments, ongoing investments in the marketplace and strength in the away-from-home channel were other positives. Volume for the developed markets improved in the low-single digits in the quarter, driven by strength across markets. Meanwhile, the developing and emerging markets declined in the low-single digits.Coming to the category cluster performance, volume growth was even for sparkling soft drinks, driven by even sales for the trademark Coca-Cola, 9% growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and a 2% decline in sparkling flavors. The sparkling soft drinks category benefited from the strong performances in Latin America and the Asia Pacific, offset by the suspension of business in Russia.Volume for nutrition, juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages declined 7% in the fourth quarter. The category was primarily hurt by the suspension of the business in Russia, offset by strong growth in developed markets.The water, sports, coffee and tea category were flat in the fourth quarter. Coca-Cola witnessed flat results for the water category as growth in Latin America was almost fully offset by declines in China, owing to the varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions. Sports drinks rose 1% due to solid performances in Latin America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Tea volume was down 9%, as gains in Fuze Tea in Latin America were negated by the softness in dogadan in Turkey. The coffee business witnessed 11% growth on the cycling impacts of the closure of Costa retail outlets in the U.K. in the prior year and the expansion of Costa coffee across markets.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRevenues rose 25% for Latin America, 14% for North America, 3% for the Asia Pacific and 4% for Bottling Investments, while the same declined 7% for EMEA and 5% for Global Ventures.Organic revenues improved 9% in EMEA, 32% in Latin America, 12% in North America, 15% in the Asia Pacific, 8% in Global Ventures and 16% in Bottling Investments.MarginsIn dollar terms, the operating income increased 24% year over year to $2,075 million, including a 10-point impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating income rose 10.9% year over year. Comparable currency-neutral operating income advanced 21% on strong organic revenue growth across all segments, offset by higher operating costs and marketing investments.The operating margin of 20.5% in the fourth quarter expanded 280 basis points (bps) from 17.7% in the prior-year quarter. The comparable operating margin expanded 60 bps to 22.7%, driven by higher operating revenues, offset by the impacts of the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, elevated marketing investments and currency headwinds.GuidanceManagement has outlined its view for 2023. It anticipates organic revenue growth of 7-8% for 2023. Comparable revenues are expected to be impacted by a 2-3% currency headwind based on current rates. The guidance includes a 1% negative impact of acquisition and divestiture.The company expects an impact of a mid-single-digit percentage from commodity price inflation on comparable cost of goods sold. The company anticipates an underlying effective tax rate of 19.5% for 2023.Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share are estimated to increase 7-9%. The company anticipates year-over-year comparable earnings per share growth of 4-5%. Its comparable earnings per share growth is likely to include a headwind of 3-4% from currency and a slight headwind from acquisitions and divestitures.For first-quarter 2023, comparable revenues are expected to include a 5-6% currency headwind and a 1% negative impact of acquisitions. Comparable earnings per share are estimated to include a currency headwind of 6-7%.Management envisions an adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion for 2023, including $11.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditure is likely to be $1.9 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Coke has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Coke has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCoke is part of the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry. Over the past month, PepsiCo (PEP), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.4%.

343,3989cac9-6bb1-3993-91f5-cd063b1431f4,UNP,2023-03-17,Here's Why Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-union-pacific-nyse-140027080.html,1678975227,STORY,['UNP'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Fast Is Union Pacific Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Union Pacific has grown EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Union Pacific's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. On the revenue front, Union Pacific has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 14% to US$25b but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. If EBIT margins are able to stay balanced and this revenue growth continues, then we should see brighter days ahead.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$188m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does Union Pacific Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Union Pacific is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Union Pacific   you should know about.Although Union Pacific certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

The company is facing the heat due to the escalation in fuel costs, as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front.In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities.

The company's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk due to higher technological resource prices. A comparative analysis of the stock's trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/Sales ratio shows a gloomy picture that may concern investors.Nevertheless, Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider which focuses on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities by investing heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects.

345,170d7c88-c3a3-3b31-83a8-6265f99ce30d,AMP,2023-03-17,Scoop up These 4 GARP Stocks to Get Handsome Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scoop-4-garp-stocks-handsome-123312052.html,1678969992,STORY,"['GWW', 'AMP', 'EWBC']","[If you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing. Ameriprise Financial AMP, W.W. Grainger GWW, East West Bancorp EWBC and Bloomin’ Brands BLMN are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsBoth a strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that both growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.Using the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Story continuesScreening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS &amp; projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE than the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four of the six stocks that made it through the screening process:Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company that offers a wide range of products and services focused on financial planning and advice.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits. Corporate greed is always a popular topic in the press. And, firms are to blame for some extent as well. There are well known examples of tax evasion, through which multinationals such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been caught funneling their profits through low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland to take advantage of low tax rates. In fact, Apple's variation of the popular Double Irish tax evasion scheme led to the company being fined a whopping 13.5 billion Euros by the European Commission for tax evasion - a decision that was later overturned by a court.The Double Irish used to be a popular tax minimization approach from U.S. companies through which they would set up two different entities in Ireland, one in an EU country, and another one in a tax free jurisdiction such as Bermuda. The U.S. corporation would develop technology in its home country, sell it to the Bermuda arm, which would mark it up as an asset and license it to the first Irish company, which would license it to the EU branch for it to further license it to the second Irish company which would then sell the product to the customer. The resulting income from the sale would be parked in Bermuda, and lent out to the U.S. based company enabling it to avoid taxes - hence the term 'Double Irish' due to the two Irish entities.To improve their public image, contribute to society, and attract customers, corporations such as Apple also have generous donation programs through which they match employees' charitable contributions. These contributions have been on the uptick lately, with data from National Philanthropic Trust showing that corporate giving stood at $21 billion by 2021 end, for a heartwarming 23.8% annual increase. Of course, as the Harvard Business Review notes, charitable giving also provides firms with a competitive advantage, as firms use some, particularly sponsorships, to highlight their brand. The Review uses the example of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to point out that while the firm spent $75 million in charitable contributions in 1999, it spent another $100 million to advertise them as well.Story continuesToday, we'll look at more than a handful of companies that donate to nonprofits, with some of these being Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).26 Companies that Donate to NonprofitsPixabay/Public domainOur MethodologyWe started off by finding as many companies as we could with nonprofit donation initiatives.

How did that experience provide a foundation for the work you are focusing on today?Mary: The learnings I've had on a purely social impact side over the last 20 years have allowed me to understand the philosophy of shared value, which was first introduced in 2011. Shared value is how a company can have policies and practices that help to advance the business while also helping individuals and communities where it operates thrive. Think of it like an expanding sphere of influence. Our purpose builds on and deepens this philosophy. When we say we are Powering an Inclusive Future for All, we mean for our business and our communities, our customers, partners, suppliers and other stakeholders. These groups are linked, and we can only achieve an inclusive future for all by all - meaning by working in partnership towards common goals.There is also the Theory of Change, which is a methodology that explains how taking certain steps can lead to specific changes. Through my prior roles, I've seen the difference between theory and what you need to do on the ground to make an impact. For example, after Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S. Gulf Coast, Cisco wanted to help the affected communities, and we felt that the communities couldn't recover if they didn't have schools up and working. So, I went to New Orleans and Mississippi to develop Cisco's 21st Century Schools Initiative with local school districts. This experience allowed me to think beyond the initial response and focus long-term: how can we create resilient communities?Story continuesAs I shift into my CSO role, I am still thinking about designing for impact. When making public goals, such as positively impacting 1 billion people by 2025, we need to do the work to define the outcomes we are looking for and plan in ways that allow us to pivot, make shifts, and changes. It's important to understand what it takes to design for impact and how to execute that plan to make that impact a reality.What are your primary objectives as CSO?Mary: First, being Cisco´s CSO is an honor and privilege. There is a rich history of hundreds of people across the company who have worked passionately in this space. There has always been a sense of community, and I am proud of the network of people who have been setting and achieving goals, carrying the work forward, and making a real impact in this space.My primary objective as CSO is to steward environmental sustainability initiatives across Cisco. As we think about our strategy, we're focusing on how we can decarbonize our business and embed circularity. Equally important is looking at how we can enable sustainable growth and innovation. The greatest opportunity is on helping our customers, partners, and other stakeholders decarbonize their business and embed circularity. Cisco's technology and ecosystem can play a significant role in the twin transition to a digital and low-carbon economy.We also want to continue enhancing how we report our progress in an authentic and transparent way. As we think about achieving sustainability goals, it often involves a bit of math. How we measure our actions is underpinned by data, which guides our decisions, and it allows us to create more robust conversations with our stakeholders, so they can also make informed decisions around their sustainability commitments. Data helps understand what sustainability strategies work for one community and how we might shift and adapt for another.Sustainability is integral to Cisco's purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. Can you tell us more about why a sustainable future includes a more inclusive one?Mary: We can't have inclusive and resilient communities if we don't have a healthy planet. As we look at climate change, the communities impacted the most are our most vulnerable. Research shows that people most affected by climate catastrophic events, like hurricanes or droughts, live in poverty. In the Horn of Africa, over 20 million people's lives and livelihoods are being threatened by drought, and we are working with our nonprofit partner, Mercy Corps, on a climate adaptation and resilience program to support pastoralist farmers in Northeast Kenya, who have been severely impacted by the drought.When we talk about the twin transition to a digital and low-carbon economy, how do we enable people to participate? As climate changes, people with resources are the ones who can generally better adapt, move to another location or work from anywhere. However, that is only the case for some. Communities at the forefront of the climate crisis lack the resources to adapt to, respond to, and recover from an increasing number of crises, such as extreme weather, food insecurity, and water scarcity, which leads to mass migration and displacement as well as social instability and conflict.When you think about the impact of climate on those communities, it comes down to resiliency. Communities that can adapt have rigorous infrastructure and the economic capability to withstand it. They have a sense of community and a citizenry that can adapt and be better prepared. There's an opportunity to empower people to help them build resilient communities that can better withstand the consequences of climate change.Cisco's goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2040 and near-term targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Can you explain the significance of this?Mary: The science tells us that to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times requires increased ambition and adoption of robust emissions reduction targets at the pace and scale required by climate science. As we think about the role that Cisco can play in decarbonization, we decided to set a public goal around net zero with near term targets that incorporates a methodology around absolute reductions.Having external validation from SBTi's new Net-Zero Standard signals that we are committed to the deep emissions reduction that are needed to reduce global warming. To earn SBTi validation, companies are required to reduce their emissions by at least 90%. This requirement means we can't rely on carbon offsets for more than 10% of our emissions reduction. This external validation demonstrates that our calculations and approach align with accepted standards and creates transparency and trust among stakeholders.In 2021, the Cisco Foundation committed $100 million over ten years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. Could you share more about this strategy?Mary: This strategy supports early-stage solutions with the potential to scale and be replicable. It aligns with the long-standing social impact investment strategy that we have leveraged from the Cisco Foundation in disaster response, critical human needs, education, and economic empowerment.When you think about climate, there is a unique role that Cisco can play. Going back to our net zero goal, we know there's going to be need for changing practices, such as a shift to regenerative agriculture. We know there will be a need for new innovative decarbonization technologies. Whether it is a nonprofit or an interesting area of impact investing, the Cisco Foundation team has the ability to identify how we can nurture them through the cycle of innovation.An example from our climate portfolio is Vesta, a hybrid nonprofit/public-benefit enterprise. Their solution is to capture carbon from the atmosphere and support coastal resilience by using the mineral olivine. The carbon-capture properties and safety of olivine have been proven in lab settings. But what happens outside the lab? We are investing in that research and enabling Vesta to test it in real-world circumstances to study its effects on wildlife and ecosystems and to see if it is sequestering carbon at the same pace we saw in the lab. This is an excellent example of designing for impact and how we can foster potentially exciting and effective solutions.We know we can't do this alone. How is Cisco helping our customers and the world create a more sustainable future?Mary: We want to provide solutions that help support sustainability goals.Our customers want to do more, and our ability to continue driving solutions that can improve energy efficiency can support their scope 1 and 2 GHG reduction goals. Our circular design principles can support customers who want to reduce waste across their value chain. Cisco can play an important part in our customers´ digital transformation. We can help them understand how technology can change how they run their business, whether through hybrid work, creating smart buildings like Cisco's PENN1, or designing more modular products that are easier to upgrade, repair, and reuse. We can show them how we can use technology to increase impact while reducing their footprint.A final example I'll share is our Country Digital Acceleration program, where we collaborate with government leaders to build sustainable, secure, and inclusive communities powered by ethical and innovative technology solutions. For example, in the United Kingdom, we led the E-Flex consortium, an innovation project to prove the potential of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which can allow unused energy in electric car batteries to be taken back into the electricity grid. If it proves successful at scale, V2G could become a critical part of a lower-carbon future, as well as help energy managers reduce operational costs.When I think about education, awareness and innovation, it is a journey. Part of the opportunity of being a CSO is being able to harness the inspiration and creativity of our employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders to work towards the climate future we want.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/744212/Building-More-Sustainable-and-Resilient-Communities-An-Interview-With-Ciscos-Chief-Sustainability-Officer]"
