The company's market valuation decreased by US$7.2b after the stock price dropped 4.5% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Texas InstrumentsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Richard Templeton, sold US$5.9m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$170. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Texas Instruments didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Texas Instruments Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Texas Instruments shares. Specifically, Senior VP &amp; CTO Ahmad R. S. Bahai ditched US$200k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$167m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Texas Instruments Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Texas Instruments stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Texas Instruments is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. When we did our research, we found 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

5,8ceec77b-ca59-3c6a-86f1-259506d3fe1c,XYL,2022-12-19,The 7 Hottest Water Stocks to Own for 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-hottest-water-stocks-own-173629988.html,1671125789,STORY,"['TGT', 'YORW', 'VIE.PA', 'CWCO', 'AWK', 'XYL', 'WTRG']","[Although investors frequently target technological innovators to generate profits in the market, the hottest water stocks to own leverages the power of the world’s most precious resource. True, 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, making it appear a common commodity. However, only half a percent of the Earth’s water is drinkable.Just that stat alone provides an immediate sharpening of the concept surrounding the hottest water stocks to own. Further, as the world’s population continues to increase, a mathematical conundrum materializes. For decades now, geopolitical experts warned that the wars of tomorrow could be fought over water, not oil.For this discussion, I don’t want to get too macabre. However, it’s important to lay out the facts and not take this resource – or its management – for granted. With that in mind, below are the hottest water stocks to own for 2023 and beyond.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWTRGEssential Utilities$47.63AWKAmerican Water Works$156.19YORWYork Water$45.06XYLXylem$109.99CWCOConsolidated Water$15.04VEOEYVeolia Environment$25.95SMRNuScale Power$10.36Essential Utilities (WTRG)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comAn American utility firm, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) has stakes in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. Per its public profile, Essential Utilities provides drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. Currently, the company commands a market capitalization of $12.7 billion. On a year-to-date basis, WTRG dipped more than 8%. However, in the trailing month, shares gained 3%.Last month, the company beat top-and-bottom line estimates for earnings and revenue. Essential delivered earnings per share of 26 cents, beating the consensus target of 23 cents. Further, it posted operating revenue of $435 million, easily exceeding analysts’ view of $376 million.Story continuesTo be fair, the financials present somewhat of a mixed narrative. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, WTRG rates as a modestly undervalued investment. However, the company’s balance sheet could use some work, particularly with a lowly Altman Z-Score that suggests higher-than-normal risk of bankruptcy. Still, with strong revenue growth and profit margins, Essential owns the goods to succeed. Therefore, it ranks among the hottest water stocks to own.American Water Works (AWK)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comAnother public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) through its subsidiaries provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company offers water and wastewater services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states serving a population of approximately 14 million through 3.4 million customer connections. Since the start of the year, AWK gave up 14% of equity value. However, in the trailing month, shares gained over 8%.As with Essential Utilities above, American Water could use some work in the balance sheet. Again, the Altman Z-Score is a bit distracting at 1.32, reflecting higher-than-normal bankruptcy risk. As well, it features a poor cash-to-debt ratio of only 0.01 times. Still, AWK attracts positive attention overall. Per TipRanks, the company features a moderate buy consensus view.In addition, American Water has a three-year book growth rate of 7.4%, beating out over 67% of the competition. As well, its return on equity pings at 17.8%, reflecting superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits. Thus, it’s well worth consideration among the hottest water stocks to own.York Water (YORW)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comAn investor-owned, public utility company operating in Pennsylvania, York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) features a very rich history. Founded in 1816 by a group of local business men concerned about fire protection, York is the oldest company of its kind in this country. As well, it has the longest record of consecutive dividends since 1816.Just for context, James Monroe was elected as POTUS in 1816. And while contemporary politics loves to mention the Founding Fathers, Monroe actually was one. Unfortunately for YORW stakeholders, heritage alone couldn’t save the underlying company from market volatility. Since the January opener, YORW dipped almost 7%. However, shares have enjoyed near-term momentum. In the trailing month, they gained 4.5%, possibly reflecting the early innings of a recovery.Depending on the metrics you use, YORW runs between fairly valued to significantly overvalued. However, under these circumstances, people may continue to pay a premium for stability. Also, keep in mind that York is a decent-quality business, featuring a ROE of nearly 11%. Thus, it’s a solid idea for the hottest water stocks to own.Xylem (XYL)a picture of waterSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered Rye Brook, New York, Xylem (NYSE:XYL) is a large American water technology provider, in public utility, residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial settings. Per its corporate profile, the company does business in more than 150 countries. Its products and services are focused in two areas: water infrastructure and applied water.Since the start of the year, XYL comes in around 2% below parity. That’s a decent performance considering that during the same period, the benchmark equities index is down nearly 17%. However, shares really came alive during the back half of 2022. Specifically, in the trailing six months, XYL gained a whopping 50%.To be fair, such a performance came at a cost. According to Gurufocus.com – against both its proprietary FMV calculations and traditional metrics – XYL rates as overvalued. On the plus side, Xylem’s Altman Z-Score hits 3.94, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Also, Xylem is another decent quality enterprise with an ROE of 10%, making it one of the hottest water stocks.Consolidated Water (CWCO)Source: ShutterstockBased in the Cayman Islands, Consolidated Water (NASDAQ:CWCO) is an international water solutions company, supplying potable water, treating water for reuse, and manufacturing and providing water-related products and services. Its customer base covers the Bahamas, the U.S., the British Virgin Islands along with its home market.If you’ve ever doubted the pertinence of the hottest water stocks to own for the future, just look at CWCO. Since the January opener, shares exploded higher to the tune of 45%. Better yet, the back half performance is similarly robust, with CWCO gaining nearly 21% in the trailing six months.If anything, the one analyst that covers Consolidated Water likes it too, pegging it as a moderate buy. As well, the price target is $20, reflecting a respectable double-digit gain from the time-of-writing price of $15.58.Per Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculation, CWCO is fairly valued. Investors should check out its balance sheet, particularly its robust cash balance. If you want a long-term idea, CWCO rates as one of the hottest water stocks to own.Veolia Environment (VEOEY)Source: ShutterstockMoving into the more speculative realm of the hottest water stocks to own, Veolia Environment (OTCMKTS:VEOEY) may intrigue market gamblers. A French transnational firm, Veolia features activities in three main service and utility areas traditionally managed by public authorities: water management, waste management and energy services.In particular, Veolia may represent a compelling idea because of its expertise in desalination. Per its website, desalination allows converting seawater into a life sustaining and usable resource. As one of the holy grails at the intersection of science and economics, desalination works. However, getting the process to financially make sense represents another matter altogether.Currently, VEOEY shareholders stare at a loss of over 27% in the charts. However, in the trailing month, the stock rebounded, gaining more than 5%.Against forward earnings, VEOEY rates as a fairly valued investment. Performance metrics in the balance sheet and income statement run somewhere in the middle of the road: not great, not terrible. Nevertheless, if you like high-risk wagers, Veolia could be one of the hottest water stocks to own.NuScale Power (SMR)Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comTo be completely upfront with you, NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) is not a direct play among the hottest water stocks. Rather, the company plies its trade in the nuclear power industry. However, NuScale does things differently, specializing in small modular reactors. As the name suggests, SMRs occupy a smaller physical footprint and integrates the latest safety protocols. Therefore, these facilities can integrate in areas previously inaccessible for traditional nuclear powerplants.What does this have to do with the world’s most precious resource? The combination of NuScale’s SMR technology and available desalination platforms can make the process of converting ocean water into potable water an economically viable enterprise. Per NuScale’s website, a single SMR coupled to a desalination plant can produce 77 million gallons of clean water.To be fair, investors interested in SMR stock should realize that the underlying company presents risks. However, if you’re comfortable with market wagers, NuScale is easily one of the hottest water stocks to own.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This was done for the ethanol supply year from December 1, 2022, to October 31, 2023, which coincides with the current sugar season. The Centre, in a press release, stated that the higher price of sugarcane-derived ethanol for oil marketing companies (OMC) is a bid to benefit distilleries and will “help in early payment to cane farmers.” The central government’s cabinet committee on economic affairs approved this higher price.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureIndia is keen to reduce its dependence on imported crude oil, and ethanol-blended petrol is part of its strategy. In addition, ethanol, a biofuel, is a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels. Also, as it is derived from sugar and starch-rich agricultural byproducts, it helps provide an additional use of these products and boosts incomes for farmers.Graphic: Technology for Wildlife FoundationThe National Biofuel Policy of 2018 (pdf) gives impetus to increase ethanol production from sugar molasses, sugarcane juice, sugar-containing materials (sugar beet, sweet sorghum) and starch-containing materials (corn, cassava, damaged food grains such as wheat, broken rice, rotten potatoes) that are unfit for human consumption. Currently, India has reached a 10% blending target, with 450 crore (4.5 billion) liters of ethanol already being produced. It aspires to reach a 20% target by 2025, for which it will need to produce 1,000 crore litres of ethanol.In addition, India’s consumer affairs, food, and public distribution ministry has prioritized the availability of 275 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of sugar for domestic consumption, over 50 LMT of sugar for diversion to ethanol production, and over 60 LMT for exports.Story continuesEarlier in September, in an interview with the Economic Times, Atul Chaturvedi, chairman of Shree Renuka Sugars, said that India is now a “sugar surplus” country, and “cyclicality is a thing of the past”. Shree Renuka Sugars is one of the largest sugar producers and refiners in the country. This means that the sugarcane crop has a growth cycle of 12-14 months, followed by five-six months of crushing in factories. However, with a focus on ethanol production, factories will be able to run the entire year.A sugar factory owner based in Kagwad, Karnataka (lies on the border of Maharashtra and Karnataka), on condition of anonymity, told Mongabay-India that they currently make two lakh litres of ethanol in a day. “We intend to up this production to 30 lakh litres per day, for 300 days a year,” he said.Ethanol, a biofuel, is a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, and it is derived from sugar and starch-rich agricultural byproducts. It helps provide additional use for these products and boosts farmer incomes. Sugarcane, a water-intensive cropIndia is one of the largest producers of sugarcane in the world, with Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka being the major sugar-producing states. There are over 700 sugar mills in the country, with a capacity to crush 340 lakh metric tonnes of sugar and an annual turnover of Rs80,000 crores. The sugar industry provides livelihoods for nearly five crore (50 million) people.This year, Maharashtra, which has over 200 sugar mills, lent 14.87 lakh hectares of its land to sugarcane farming, Shekar Gaikwad, the state’s sugar commissioner, told Mongabay-India, adding that Maharashtra, by itself is the third largest producer of sugarcane in the world, after India and Brazil. “As a stand-alone state, it is way ahead of Thailand, Australia, and all the countries of the European Union.” Gaikwad also said that last year, India exported 110 lakh metric tonnes of sugar, of which, 70 lakh metric tonnes came from Maharashtra. This year, Maharashtra is slated to produce 138 lakh tonnes of sugar, of which 12 lakh tonnes will be diverted towards ethanol production, he said.Sugarcane is also a water guzzler. According to a March 2020 report by Niti Aayog, one kilogram of sugar needs 1,500-2,000 litres of water. A large part of Maharashtra, however, falls under a drought-prone, rain shadow area.Representational image of a sugarcane field.The cash crop’s growth cycle lasts for 12-15 months, from the time the saplings are sown till the time the crop is harvested. Farmers in Maharashtra told Mongabay-India that, on average, one acre of land produces 60-80 tonnes of sugarcane and needs nine lakh litres of water twice a month. This monthly irrigation cycle depends on the region, the topography, the soil, and the availability of water and electricity. So, if the entire growth cycle of sugarcane is 12-15 months, then one acre of land would need nearly 216 lakh litres of water per annual growth cycle. In effect, a tonne of sugarcane could soak up 3 lakh litres of water in a growth cycle.The harvested cane is taken to the factory, where it is crushed and separated into sugarcane juice, molasses, filter cake, and bagasse. Sugarcane juice is used to make sugar, bagasse is used in electricity generation and filter cake is used as a fertilizer. Molasses, a by-product of sugarcane, is usually used in ethanol production. Two types of molasses are used for ethanol production: molasses-C and molasses-B. Molasses-C is a final by-product from sugar processing with no economically extractable sugar remaining, and molasses-B is an intermediate by-product with some extractable sugar remaining.Niti Aayog’s report (pdf) explains that a litre of ethanol produced from sugarcane consumes at least 2,860 litres of water in the process. A July 2020 research paper titled Water-food-energy challenges in India: political economy of the sugar industry published in Environmental Research Letters, states that India’s aspiration of 20% ethanol blending by 2025, if dependent on molasses, will require 1320 million tons of sugarcane, 19 million hectares of additional land and 348 billion cubic metres of additional water. With the increased production of sugarcane, there would be 161 million tonnes of extra sugar production. The paper, by researchers at Stanford University in the United States, recommends using only sugarcane juice for ethanol production (versus directly from molasses), which would not require additional water and land resources.Farmers voice their issues, demandsDespite the water-guzzling nature of the crop, farmers prefer to grow sugarcane. One of the main reasons for it is that it is the only crop that offers a guaranteed Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP). FRP is a price set by the state government that sugar mills are mandated to pay the farmers for the cane obtained from them. The Sugar Control Order of 1966 regulates the payment of FRP across the nation. It also requires the mills to pay the farmers within 14 days of the cane’s delivery. Earlier in February, the Maharashtra government allowed sugar mills to pay farmers in two installments—the first installment within 14 days of delivery, and the second based on the final recovery of the product. However, the farmers are not happy with this latest decision.In March 2022, Raju Shetti, president and founder of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, one of the largest farmer unions in the state, filed a writ petition at the Bombay High Court challenging the government resolution for staggered payments, calling it contradictory to sugarcane pricing policy. The petition is in progress in court.Farmers say that their loans and other expenses have to be paid as per usual, so the payment in installments, based on unknown variables, does not benefit them. “We have to take loans from the banks to collect money to buy raw materials for the crop, sapling, and then tend to it for at least a year,” said Dattatarahi Kasorde, a sugarcane farmer in Kolhapur. “Then it is only after one year and a month of delivering the cane do we receive our money. It makes more sense to give us the money altogether, and not in installments. Else, we will always remain in debt.”Sugarcane farmers protesting against the staggered payment system for their crops. More recently, on Oct. 15, over 60,000 sugarcane farmers from across Maharashtra came together to call for a fixed price of sugarcane, and discuss the various issues they faced and demands they had. The farmers gathered for Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathana’s 21st Kisaan Sammelan (farmers’ get-together) in Jaysingpur, a village in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district.In November, when crushing began, a few parts of Maharashtra witnessed standoffs as farmers sought a higher price for their sugarcane produce—deflating tyres of tractor trolleys transporting harvest to the factory and protests in front of the sugar commissioner’s office.Shetti told Mongabay-India that they also need the FRP to be higher this year. “Increase the rate of sugar or increase the rate of sugarcane. The cost price of raw material–fertilizers, diesel etc. has shot up. If the industry is doing as well as it claims to be doing, then why are the farmers not benefiting?”“Normally, the mill owners do not pay on time, even though it is mandated under the sugar control order,” said sugar commissioner Gaikwad. “They are also required to pay a 15% interest if they fail to pay the farmers within 15 days. Nobody pays interest. There is a legal provision. They are even unable to pay basic FRP,” he continued. According to him, most sugar mills in the state are going under losses. “Most mills have negative balance sheets, negative net-worths. They are turning into NPA (non-performing assets),” he told Mongabay-India.But he added that as compared to other states, Maharashtra is doing much better. “Yesterday a fortnightly report was sent where we stated that we gave around 99.8% FRP and only 65 crores are yet to be paid. U.P. is 500 crores in arrears, Gujarat is 1200 crores in arrears, Punjab is 800 crore arrears—in spite of huge production and turnover we could pay almost 100%,” he said when Mongabay-India interviewed him in mid-October.Meanwhile, Shetti said that while the judiciary works on the side, protests are important to get noticed. “Nobody will hear us, pay any heed to our demands if we don’t bring ourselves on the road. We won’t give up till our demands are met,” he said.This post first appeared on Mongabay India.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

You can skip our detailed analysis of factors leading to a brand becoming overrated and its consequences and head directly to 5 Most Overrated Companies and Brands Heading into 2023. Factors Leading to Brands Becoming OverratedBrand-recognition strategies can be highly effective in increasing revenue. However, a brand can become a victim of its own success due to factors that can be avoided. These include complacency, rigid bureaucratic frameworks that arise as a result of scaling and other corrosive business practices like bad customer service.However, one core factor has specifically to do with luxury goods. Luxury companies price their products on value-based pricing, which is tied around their wealthy customers’ perceived value of their products for social status. McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, stated that the luxury apparel industry is well-placed in the ongoing market downturn to outperform the rest of the clothing industry. It puts the CAGR of luxury fashion at 5-10% in the US in 2023, since its core market comprises affluent customers mostly insulated from the impact of rising interest rates and inflation. However, its Consumer Pulse survey also showed that more people from the luxury brands’ peripheral market have switched from top-tier brands to private-label products for lower prices than at any other time since the Covid pandemic began. Impact of Brand ReviewsOverrated brands do not directly suffer from declining revenue, at-least in the short to medium term. What they directly result in, is bad customer reviews. Reviews play an important role in the global economy, especially in the American economy where consumers are highly inclined to give their feedback about products they buy and use other people's feedback while making a buying decision.A Quality Logo Product survey shows 85% of people trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Bad reviews can lead to a halt in the growth of customer-base and then eventually, dwindling reputation may even lead to a decline in revenue due to customer alienation and the background inflation rate.  Story continuesAccording to data from Statista, 92% of potential customers are less likely to buy from a negatively reviewed business. The reviews for most of these overrated brands and companies can be checked out on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L), among others.Photo by Erik Mclean on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe’ve ranked brands and companies based on the review ratings from Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L), a major consumer-review platform, where consumers rate a company with stars, with 5-stars being the best and 1 star being the worst. We’ve also accounted for customer service and general sentiment around the brands in question. For major brands, we’ve also discussed consumer survey results from sources like American Affluence Research Center and also considered brands from the book Obsessive Branding Disorder, by journalist Lucas Conley.Let’s dive in. Here's the 15 most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.15. Champion, by Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)Trustpilot Rating: 2.5 (Poor)Champion is a sportswear clothing brand owned and operated by the US apparel company Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI). Based on its Trustpilot reviews categorized as “poor”, the brand has quality control as well as customer service issues. Some other customers claimed that the products they had ordered from their store were never delivered. Champion is one of the largest brands of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) which the latter acquired in 2016 for $90 million. 14. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Trustpilot Rating: 2.4 (Poor)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a Seattle-based multinational chain of coffee houses. The company is a household name due to its nearly 36,000 coffee houses across the globe. It’s penetrated in pop-culture as well, featuring in movies like Mean Girls. However, it has largely fallen out of favor with consumers, who claim that it is overrated. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a poor rating of 2.4 on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L) based on 1,565 reviews. Majority of reviewers complained about low maintenance, mediocre quality and unreasonable cost. Despite that, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is growing fairly well. Its YoY growth for fiscal year 2022 was 11% from the previous year.It's largely due to the fact that famous (not necessarily popular) brands often end up becoming status symbols. For instance, a University-of-Leicester study has discovered that consumption of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) food and beverages by the Chinese urban middle class is associated with status rather than quality of their products.  13. Dunkin’ DonutsTrustpilot Rating: 2.3 (Poor)Dunkin’ Donuts is an American doughnut and coffee company based in Canton, Massachusetts. It has a poor rating of 2.2 based on 181 reviews on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L). Dunkin’ Donuts has over 11,300 restaurants worldwide, with 8,500 in the US alone, making it a prominent brand. However, consumer reviews paint a rather negative picture, with many reviewers complaining about the quality of food, sanitation and customer service on Trustpilot. Dunkin’ Donuts has also been featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder, as an example of an overrated brand.12. GucciTrustpilot Rating: 2.1 (Poor)Gucci is a high-end fashion house headquartered in Florence, Italy. The company designs and sells products like luxury apparel, handbags and wallets, shoes, jewelry as well as watches and many other luxury items. However, 1,217 reviews on Trustpilot put Gucci’s rating at a poor 2.1, with a good majority of reviewers complaining about customer service issues, followed by product quality relative to cost.Gucci's products can be bought from their official store as well as from platforms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Target Corporation (NASDAQ:TGT), eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).11. Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)Trustpilot Rating: 2.0 (Poor)Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is a world-famous company of women’s undergarments based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.  The company has close to 1,350 retail outlets across the world. Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co.

Its products’ prices rose by 83% in 2021 from  the mid-2019, according to a UBS report.Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is another brand on the list of most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023 that has been described as overrated by Lucas Conley.10. PradaTrustpilot Rating: 1.9 (Poor)Prada, owned and operated by Prada S.p.A (PRDSY) and based in Milan, Italy, is another household name in the luxury market.

It has a poor rating of 1.9 on Trustpilot9. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV)Trustpilot Rating: 1.9 (Poor)Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is one of the largest airlines in the United States. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is yet another company to be featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder as an overrated company. Being also the largest low cost carrier in the world, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) naturally became very prominent with customers around the world and especially in the US. However, a PR disaster from 2008 dented the company’s reputation among consumers.The airline allegedly kept flying 46 airplanes for over 60,000 flights without inspections for fuselage cracks, as reported by New York Times. This resulted in a hefty $10 million fine by the Federal Aviation Authority.It is the ninth on the list of most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.8. SupremeTrustpilot Rating: 1.8 (Poor)Supreme is a lifestyle clothing brand based in New York City and is one of the most overrated brands heading into 2023. Based on over 400 reviews on Trustpilot, the company has a poor rating of 1.8.

(NYSE:GPS)Trustpilot Rating: 1.7 (Bad)The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is an American multinational apparel and accessories brand. It has over 2,800 stores across the world, to give you a perspective on its widespread prominence. That said, The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is also thought of as overrated.

(NYSE:NKE)Trustpilot Rating: 1.7 (Bad)NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an American manufacturer of sports-related apparel and accessories and really needs no further introduction given the business clout the company enjoys all over the world. But, the brand has received overwhelmingly negative reviews on Trustpilot, from close to 6,000 consumers, leading to NIKE, Inc.

Top trends to keep an eye on in the New Year include ongoing price action, investment in digital, restaurant design, and tipping, experts told Yahoo Finance.'More pricing in 2023'In 2022, menu prices increased by 12.9%, per new data from Pricelisto.com. Consumers can expect that number to rise even more in the New Year, according to analysts.""You're going to continue to see some more pricing in 2023,"" Peter Saleh, BTIG managing director and restaurant analyst, told Yahoo Finance, as fast food giants ""try and offset some of these inflationary pressures, which for the most part right now really haven't really eased yet.""Per the November Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI), the cost to dine out is still up 8.5% compared to last year, up 0.5% month-over-month. Saleh noted ""what they took did not fully offset the mid to mid-teens commodity inflation... They're not back to kind of even on that front.""Morningstar Analyst Sean Dunlop is on the same page. ""We'll particularly see that [higher prices] in the first half of the year, because a lot of operators are still looking at their own basket of costs increasing in the high single digits or sometimes low double digits.""The consumer isn't expected to pushback in 2023 though. Katie Thomas, lead at Kearney Consumer Institute, is ""bullish"" on the consumer.""We're not seeing consumers pushing back too much quite yet...they're still sort of absorbing it in the reality of the day to day, and especially even post pandemic, they still want to get out and eat out,"" she said.""Once we're through the holidays into 2023, that could start to happen ... but we're still pretty bullish on the consumer right now ... They're, they are just absorbing these price increases,"" Thomas said.Story continuesThere is an upside for the fast food giants though. Saleh said, ""A lot of the restaurants will have to continue to take some incremental pricing on, because the margins have just really come down substantially across the space.""Digital is 'the wave of the future'Camille Angenor, 17, a senior at Muhlenberg High School, places her order on a kiosk inside the newly renovated McDonald's along 5th Street Highway in Reading on Jan. 7, 2019.

Brand's recent investor day, CFO Christopher L. Turner said his aspiration is that, ""Someday, 100% of our sales should be powered by digital.""This recent quarter, the company behind Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and the Habit Burger Grill reported digital sales of nearly $6 billion, with digital mix exceeding 40%.Other chains are also seeing an increasing amount of sales come through its digital channels.In the recent quarter, McDonald's saw nearly $7 billion in digital sales, a third of total sales. At Chipotle, more than one-third, 37.2%, of total food and beverage revenue, which was $2.2 billion, were digital.Restaurant Brands International's digital sales grew 26% year-over-year, to $3.4 billion, representing a third of total sales. Following the quarterly report, the company, which owns Popeyes, Burger King, Tim Hortons and Firehouse Subs, named Patrick Doyle as Executive Chairman. Dolye is best down for driving digital growth as the former CEO of Domino's Pizza from 2010 to 2018. Earlier this year, Burger King announced a $400 million plan to bring it into the future, including advertising and digital investments.Don't expect any slowdown soon either, Saleh told Yahoo Finance. There will not be ""pullback and spending on trying to drive digital,"" he said.""I think this is the wave of the future, almost every company out there is trying to drive more digital mix ... We're going to continue to see that in '23 and '24 and, and for many years to come.""From 2022 to 2030, the digital payment market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 17.25%, per Precedence Research.Restaurant design that leads with digitalKFC's Next Gen Restaurant Design in Louisville, Kentucky. Photo taken by Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma.Speed, accuracy, and efficiency are the name of the game in 2023. Companies like KFC, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Burger King announced investments in restaurant layouts and redesigns in 2022.Earlier this year Yahoo Finance checked out KFC's Next-Gen restaurant design, which KFC Chief Development Officer Brian Cahoe called, ""forward-looking from an off-premise channel access standpoint,"" with mobile-order pickup and designated spots for delivery drivers.At Starbuck's Investor Day in September, Deborah Hall Lefevre, Starbucks Chief Technology Officer &amp; Executive Vice President noted the need to stabilize, modernize and optimize its store operations.""Our top priority is to have resilience in our digital channels because reliable store operations is just a must for our customers and our partners,"" Lefevre shared on the day.Part of Burger King's $400M plan includes investments in restaurant technology, kitchen equipment, building enhancements, remodels and relocations.Morningstar Analyst Sean Dunlop said this wave of companies investing in everything from in-store layout to delivery to drive-thru lanes is to ensure that ""omni-channel experience is relatively homogeneous for the customer.""Florida, Palm Beach Gardens, Starbucks Coffee, mature adult barista with customer, who is using mobile payment on smart phone. (Photo by: Jeff Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Tipping likely won't expand to other fast food chainsDigital tipping rolled out on the Starbucks mobile app which is ""a complement"" to its previous model, Chief Strategy &amp; Transformation Officer Frank Bitt said at during Starbucks' Investor Day, adding the feature provides ""more opportunities for customers to celebrate the great work our folks do.""Saleh expects it to stay at Starbucks, despite growing criticism.""I don't think they're gonna go back on [it] ... Whether customers utilize it or not? I don't know. I think it's here to stay.""Dunlop said don't expect it at other fast food chains, as they are already ""competing on convenience and price."" Anecdotally, he said, ""I wouldn't expect to tip for an ice cream at McDonald's drive thru.""And don't feel like you have to leave a tip, according to Ted Rossman, Bankrate.com and CreditCards.com senior industry analyst.""I don’t think you need to feel compelled to tip for fast food or a simple coffee pickup ...even if it’s awkward to have to push the 'no tip' button on the payment terminal."" Rossman, however, did say, ""It’s a nice gesture from time to time if you’re a regular at a certain coffee shop.""Rossman does warn that he expects the broader restaurant industry to utilize ""pre-entered tip suggestions in the future.""""Technology is enabling this sort of tipping, whereas the flip side is people carrying less cash and perhaps being less able to drop a few bucks in a physical tip jar or hand cash to a valet or bellhop,"" he said.Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:GS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 68% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$6.0b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 4.3% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Goldman Sachs Group, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Goldman Sachs Group. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Goldman Sachs Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Goldman Sachs Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 5.8% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$514m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 32% stake in Goldman Sachs Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Goldman Sachs Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Netflix’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Netflix What Is Netflix Worth?Good news, investors! Netflix is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $378.85, but it is currently trading at US$291 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Netflix’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Netflix?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Netflix. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NFLX is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NFLX for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NFLX. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

(NYSE:TJX) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TJX CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, sold US$6.1m worth of shares at a price of US$78.02 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$77.65. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, TJX Companies insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At TJX Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of TJX Companies shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$9.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. TJX Companies insiders own about US$149m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The TJX Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought TJX Companies stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, TJX Companies makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. When we did our research, we found 2 warning signs for TJX Companies (1 is concerning!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course TJX Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Both contracts were still trading near one-year lows, having logged steep declines in recent sessions on fears of a potential recession in 2023.But a pledge from the U.S. government that it will begin refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) from February also served as a buy signal for markets. The Biden administration said on Friday that it will initially buy 3 million barrels of oil, while also engaging in fixed-price purchases of crude.The U.S. government drew heavily from the SPR in a bid to cap rising fuel prices this year, bringing it to its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The Biden administration had also signaled that it would begin replenishing the reserve when crude prices were trading at lower levels.An earthquake in West Texas, the country’s biggest oil producing region, also ramped up fears of tightening U.S. crude supply, which benefited prices. Forecasts for a colder-than-expected winter also indicate that crude prices could be supported by more demand for heating oil in the near-term.Story continuesStill, crude prices were trading nearly flat for the year, as markets feared that rising interest rates and high inflation will result in a potential recession in 2023. A slew of hawkish signals from major central banks rattled crude markets last week, with the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank signaling that interest rates will keep rising for the near-term.Weak economic data from China also showed that the country has a long road to recovery, which could indicate a staggered recovery in demand.Related ArticlesOil rises on Chinese demand hopes, U.S. SPR replenishmentGold prices muted, copper rises on China reopening hopesEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

Gold is also well below peaks hit during the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, having largely relinquished its safe haven status to the dollar.This has also seen the yellow metal gain little in the face of a potential U.S. recession. Investors are growing increasingly wary of high inflation and rising interest rates triggering a recession in 2023.Spot gold was flat at around $1,793.55 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,802.90 an ounce by 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT).Bullion prices are expected to see little trading action for the remainder of the year, with market holidays and a lack of cues making for low volumes in the coming weeks.Other precious metals rose on Monday as the dollar inched lower, with platinum futures up 0.7%, while silver futures rose 0.6%. The two metals were also trading marginally higher for the year.Among industrial metals, copper prices surged on Monday, recovering from steep losses last week as markets bet on tightening supplies and improving demand in China going into 2023.Copper futures jumped nearly 1% to $3.8063 an ounce.The red metal was boosted by renewed hopes that major importer China will see an economic recovery in 2023, as it scales back its strict zero-COVID policy.Story continuesBut in the near-term, markets are expected to see increased volatility as easing COVID restrictions also ramp up infections in the country.Still, recent trade data showed that China’s copper imports grew steadily this year, as local manufacturers used recent weakness in prices as a buying opportunity.Related ArticlesGold prices muted, copper rises on China reopening hopesOil climbs on optimism over China's demand recoveryEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $370.39, but it is currently trading at US$246 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, General Dynamics’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from General Dynamics?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

51,93325bf0-a0e5-3d90-99e3-5ce8f168fc99,NEE,2022-12-19,NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-nyse-nee-hoping-120054977.html,1671451254,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NextEra Energy is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.027 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$156b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 2.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.6%. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NextEra Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From NextEra Energy's ROCE Trend?In terms of NextEra Energy's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 5.6%, but since then they've fallen to 2.7%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.What We Can Learn From NextEra Energy's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for NextEra Energy. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 144% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.Story continuesNextEra Energy does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Both contracts were still trading near one-year lows, having logged steep declines in recent sessions on fears of a potential recession in 2023.But a pledge from the U.S. government that it will begin refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) from February also served as a buy signal for markets. The Biden administration said on Friday that it will initially buy 3 million barrels of oil, while also engaging in fixed-price purchases of crude.The U.S. government drew heavily from the SPR in a bid to cap rising fuel prices this year, bringing it to its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The Biden administration had also signaled that it would begin replenishing the reserve when crude prices were trading at lower levels.An earthquake in West Texas, the country’s biggest oil producing region, also ramped up fears of tightening U.S. crude supply, which benefited prices. Forecasts for a colder-than-expected winter also indicate that crude prices could be supported by more demand for heating oil in the near-term.Story continuesStill, crude prices were trading nearly flat for the year, as markets feared that rising interest rates and high inflation will result in a potential recession in 2023. A slew of hawkish signals from major central banks rattled crude markets last week, with the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank signaling that interest rates will keep rising for the near-term.Weak economic data from China also showed that the country has a long road to recovery, which could indicate a staggered recovery in demand.Related ArticlesOil rises on Chinese demand hopes, U.S. SPR replenishmentGold prices muted, copper rises on China reopening hopesEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

With government agencies mandating shelter-in-place policies, going the VR route represented an alternative to socialization. Nevertheless, the sector was already booming well before the global health crisis.According to Grand View Research, the global VR market reached a valuation of $21.83 billion in 2021. Experts project that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from 2022 to 2030. By the end of the forecasted period, the sector may bring in a revenue tally of $87 billion. Therefore, investors ought to target the hottest virtual reality stocks to own for next year and beyond.MSFTMicrosoft$248.70GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$91.30METAMeta Platforms$115.52NVDANvidia$168.44QCOMQualcomm$117.16TCEHYTencent$40.26RBLXRoblox$27.01InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comA software and technology icon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) simply fits well into almost any circumstance. While it’s technically listed under the broad tech category, MSFT doesn’t carry the typical volatility (this year aside) of the underlying sector. Rather, the company established itself as a staple within the global business ecosystem. For example, its Windows operating system commands a 75.1% market share among desktops.However, MSFT really makes sense as one of the hottest virtual reality stocks to own. Fundamentally, it owns a major video game console system with the Xbox. Therefore, its VR accessories represent an organic business opportunity. And while Microsoft encountered antitrust pushback, it could potentially own Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). This too should help bolster Microsoft’s VR cred.Most importantly in my view, the company enjoys solid financials. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, MSFT rates as a modestly undervalued investment. As well, Microsoft carries a return on investment of 42.8%, reflecting a superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits.Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAnother all-around solid enterprise, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) already attracts contrarians for its value proposition. On a year-to-date basis, Alphabet shares dropped over 34% in equity value. While the present macro-environment doesn’t natively support tech firms, the discount is huge, considering that the company’s Google search engine utterly dominates the world market.Commanding relevancies in both VR and augmented reality, Alphabet presently focuses on the educational component of immersive technologies. For instance, through Google Earth VR, users can explore fascinating places from all over the planet. As well, its technology delivers perspectives that you simply can’t get as a mere mortal tourist. Thus, it makes for one of the hottest virtual reality stocks to own.Finally, Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations identify Alphabet as a significantly undervalued investment. For me, I’m looking at the strength of its balance sheet, particularly its Altman Z-Score of 9.72. This indicates a very low risk of bankruptcy. As well, the company features an ROE of 26.6%, suggesting a high-quality business.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comTo be completely fair, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has more than its fair share of downside threats. Primarily, META already hemorrhaged around 64% of market value. Further, management continues to double down on its bet regarding the metaverse or the next generation of connectivity solutions. For transparency’s sake, I’ve covered many stories regarding the harsh, high-level criticisms that Meta attracted for this commitment.Still, if you’re a believer in the hottest virtual reality stocks, then it’s difficult to ignore Meta Platforms. It’s not just the devices themselves, with the company delivering several VR headsets and accessories. It also features smart glasses thanks to its partnership with Ray-Ban. But beyond that, Meta aims to be the leader in the metaverse. Therefore, these products are a means to a greater end.Plus, we can’t forget that Meta owns Facebook, the biggest social media network in the world. True, management expressed concerns throughout this year about the digital advertisement slowdown. Still, enterprises need to advertise if they want to succeed. Arguably, there’s no better place to do it than on Facebook.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comOne of the powerhouses in the gaming arena, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) arguably generates the most attention for its graphics processing units. Powering some of the most intense applications, Nvidia’s GPUs represent the performance benchmark for professional gamers. In addition, its GPUs undergird multiple cryptocurrency-mining initiatives. Unfortunately, though, with the implosion of blockchain-related enterprises, NVDA took a massive hit.Since the start of the year, NVDA gave up over 41% of its equity value. However, in the trailing month, shares gained 6%. Could this be the start of a bullish recovery? As one of the pioneers of VR technology, Nvidia enjoys relevancies across multiple industries. From gaming to video capture to cloud-based solutions, the company delivers meaningful applications.Just as well, Nvidia represents a high-quality business. Specifically, it features strong profit margins, leading to a return on equity of 24.4%. This stat rates better than nearly 83% of the competition. It also reflects a superior capacity to convert equity financing into bottom-line expansion. Therefore, NVDA is worth a look among the hottest virtual reality stocks to buy.Qualcomm (QCOM)communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a multinational corporation specializing in the manufacturing of semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. Per its corporate profile, Qualcomm owns critical patents tied to 5G, along with prior-generation mobile communication standards. Of course, with the malaise of 2022 imposing particular hardships on the tech space, QCOM stock enjoyed no reprieve.Since the beginning of this year, QCOM gave up nearly 35% of its equity value. However, it’s starting to look a little bit more interesting. In the trailing five sessions, QCOM gained 2.5%. Leveraging its advanced Snapdragon semiconductor, Qualcomm powers far greater immersion in VR than was previously possible. In addition, the company carries relevancies for AR and mixed-reality solutions.To be fair, Gurufocus.com warns that QCOM may be a possible value trap. However, it’s difficult to agree because of pandemic-fueled distortions. Fundamentally, Qualcomm enjoys revenue growth and profit margins that rank among the underlying sector’s top echelon. Therefore, for risk-tolerant contrarians, QCOM may be one of the hottest virtual reality stocks to own.Tencent (TCEHY)Tencent stock TCEHY stockSource: ShutterstockPreviously one of the hottest stocks in general, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) tends to draw intrigue no matter what the circumstances. Based in China, Tencent is a multinational technology and entertainment conglomerate. Per its public profile, it’s one of the highest-grossing multimedia companies in the world based on revenue. Unfortunately, fissures in the Chinese economy imposed hardships on TCEHY.Since the January opener, Tencent shares gave up over 28% of their equity value. That said, it’s been rebounding sharply in recent sessions. In the past five days, it moved up almost 3%. In the trailing month, security gained nearly 13%. As Reuters noted earlier this year, Tencent plans to invest heavily in extended reality, creating unprecedented immersion in VR and AR applications.For those willing to take a shot, Tencent enjoys a very high-quality business. Per Gurufocus.com, the company’s ROE stands at 22.6%, beating out nearly 82% of its rivals. Therefore, it ranks among the hottest virtual reality stocks to own.Roblox (RBLX)An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.comFor full disclosure, I’m not entirely sold on the idea of buying Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). With the company suffering severe losses in the equities sector, the free market has already spoken loud and clear. Nevertheless, if you’re dead set on acquiring the hottest virtual reality stocks, RBLX could make for intriguing speculation. But you do have to treat it as that, legal gambling.Based in San Mateo, California, Roblox is a video game developer which specializes in a community-based endeavor. Essentially, the platform brings developers and users together in a constructive, family-friendly environment. As InvestorPlace contributor Ian Cooper argued, Roblox is “the closest thing to a mainstream social metaverse, with a mission of building a human co-experience platform that enables billions of users to come together to play, learn, communicate, explore and expand their friendships.”I can dig that sentiment.

A new report ties an increase in short-term rental listings with rising rents and home prices. Dennis Schaal / SkiftA new study on the impact of short-term rentals in Puerto Rico, where the proliferation of Airbnb listings played an outsized role in its tourism recovery following Hurricane Maria, found that a 10 percent increase in short-term rental density in relation to the total number of housing units, led to a 7 percent increase in median rents and a 23 percent jump in housing unit prices.The Center for a New Economy study used AirDNA and other data to assess short-term rental trends and their impact in Puerto Rico from 2014 to 2020. The backdrop is that Puerto Rico faces a housing crisis that includes a lack of affordable housing, as well as increasing rents, foreclosures and evictions as short-term rentals have proliferated, according to the study. The Center for a New Economy stated that hurricanes and earthquakes damaged more than 300,000 apartments and homes in Puerto Rico since 2017, exacerbating the crisis.“The large proportion of entire homes listed on short-term rental platforms signals that there are a significant number of housing units that are outside of the traditional housing market and thus unavailable for long-term rental clients,” the report found. “This is particularly worrisome in Puerto Rico given rising housing costs and the limited number of units available in certain submarkets.”The Puerto Rico government points out that the vast majority of hosts in the territory are locals, and a 2022 Oxford Economics study commissioned by Airbnb noted that 92 percent of hosts are “island-based.”But the Center for a New Economy study found that people or entities with multiple listings accounted for two-thirds of overall listings in Puerto Rico, and commanded 80 percent of the $729 million in short-term rental revenue generated on the island from 2014 to 2020.Single- Versus Multiple-Listing Hosts in Puerto Rico 2014-2020Host TypeHostsListingsRevenueCount% TotalCount% TotalCount% TotalSingle-listing hosts7,74061.2%7,74031%$154 million21.1%Multi-listing hosts4,89938.8%17,24069%$575 million78.9%Total12,63924,980$729 million“Contrary to the popular narratives surrounding short-term rentals, particularly the idea that these digital platforms mainly provide economic development opportunities for small property owners who’d like to generate a new source of additional income by subletting their underused units, this housing market segment is becoming increasingly concentrated, professionalized, and commercialized in Puerto Rico,” the study stated. “Single-listing hosts have increasingly outnumbered multiple-listing hosts since 2016, but it is the latter group who have accumulated more than two thirds of listings and almost 80 percent of accumulated revenue. As the data clearly demonstrates, the short-term rental market has tilted heavily towards professional or commercial hosts with multiple listings under their name.”Story continuesThe study, which noted that the proliferation of short-term rentals contributed to neighborhood gentrification, called for more robust regulation of short-term rentals on the island. Currently, according to the report, the island has very limited short-term rental regulation. The major element of such regulation is that the Puerto Rico Tourism Co., which oversees domestic tourism matters, collects a 7 percent room occupancy tax. That’s geared to level the playing field with the hotel industry.The earlier Airbnb-commissioned study from Oxford Economics highlighted how Airbnb guests staying in Puerto Rico in 2021 boosted gross domestic product and jobs.“The $1.7 billion of spending from guests using Airbnb in 2021 directly supported $872.4 million of GDP, 24,000 jobs in Puerto Rico, generating $460.4 million in wages, salaries and other labor income across a number of sectors,” the Oxford Economics study found.Adam Sacks, Tourism Economics president, said via email that he doesn’t see a contradiction between his company’s report and the housing impact study from the Center for a New Economy.“Short-term rentals have been a huge part of the tourism economy’s recovery, having been battered by successive waves of crises over the past decade,” Sacks said. “The economic benefits are significant and have played a big role in the rebound after Hurricane Maria and then Covid-19.”Sacks said short-term rentals “played a huge part of the island’s tourism recovery” given that before Hurricane Maria accommodations inventory was made up of around 15,000 hotel rooms and some 1,000 rental units, and that grew post-Maria to roughly 25,000-26,000 rooms and units together.“That said, the regulation of short-term rentals hasn’t caught up and it is impacting the housing situation in specific areas,” Sacks said. “At the same time, other factors have also distorted the housing market with mainland residents finding a tax haven in Puerto Rico under Act 22.”As shown in the following chart, the number of Airbnb listings and hosts in Puerto Rico from 2014-2020 dwarfed Vrbo’s, which the Center for a New Economy referred to as HomeAway (the predecessor company).Airbnb and Vrbo (HomeAway) Listings in Puerto Rico 2014-2020Listing TypeTotal STR ListingsAirbnb ListingsHomeAway ListingsHomeAway Managers/PartnersAirbnb HostsEntire home/apt25,19519,7944,7882810,012Hotel room1541540045Privte room4,6084,608112,399Shared room43442400183Total30,38124,9804,7892912,639Asked about the Center for a New Economy study tying short-term rentals to intensifying the housing crisis in Puerto Rico, an Airbnb spokesperson said the company wants to work with local governments on housing solutions.“Home sharing has been an important part of the fabric of Puerto Rico for decades, enabling the region to welcome visitors whose spending supports local businesses and creates economic opportunity for local residents,” the Airbnb spokesperson said. “The typical Airbnb host in Puerto Rico shares just one home and total listings represent less than one percent of the island’s housing stock. Most experts recognize the need to prioritize building new housing is an issue in communities large and small and Airbnb wants to be a good partner and work with local officials on efforts to help support housing solutions.”Expedia Group, which owns Vrbo, said in a statement that the new study can contribute to discussions about tourism regulation on the island.“Fair and effective vacation rental policies are rooted in open dialogue, reliable data, and proven solutions,” Expedia Group stated. “Expedia Group welcomes this new research as an input to discussions on how Puerto Rico can regulate tourism in a way that addresses important challenges and promotes a healthy travel economy.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 76% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Lockheed Martin. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Lockheed Martin already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lockheed Martin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lockheed Martin. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 6.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Lockheed Martin Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$85m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lockheed Martin. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Space Technology. Space exploration is one of the hottest topics these days. As compared to the decade between 2010 and 2020, interest in the sector is at an all time high globally. Before now, the U.S. Space Shuttle program had regularly piqued the attention of the American nation, but the only true global space movement occurred in the 1950s and 1960s when the U.S. and the then U.S.S.R. competed for the opportunity to first place a human on Earth orbit and then on the Moon. The U.S. and Soviet Russia were close rivals, with the latter being the first to send humans to space and make a lunar landing. But the former stole the ultimate crown when it landed astronauts on the Moon in 1969 through the Apollo program.The three and a half years between 1969 and 1972 is the only time period when humans have made their way to and across the Moon. America is the only country that has walked our closest celestial neighbor, as the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. and the relative infancy of other space programs ensured that this remarkable technological achievement remained out of reach of other countries.Fast forward to 2022, and it is appearing as if the U.S. will once again become the first to go to the Moon. NASA's Artemis program was launched in November 2022, and the Orion spacecraft successfully completed its journey around the Moon to land on Earth in December 2022. However, before we get to that, NASA is not the reason space has become a hot topic these days. Instead, the growing popularity is due to the private sector rising up to meet government agencies in establishing a regular rocket launch cadence. At the top of this list of firms is Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), whose Falcon 9 medium lift launch vehicle, or rocket, is capable of partial reuse through the remarkable feat of autonomously landing in the sea and on the ground. Watching a 135 feet tall rocket land regularly catches the public attention unlike anything else, and other firms, such as Rocket Lab, have also started to follow in SpaceX's footsteps when it comes to reusability.Story continuesThe space industry itself is based on thousands of firms that operate at different levels. These range from mega firms such as Boeing, which manufactures rockets, to those that make engines, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne, and others that provide systems and subsystems such as space suits, avionics, electrical systems, heat shields, and life support equipment.Some major players operating in the space technology include The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).12 Most Advanced Countries in Space TechnologyPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology We have ranked the countries by the total number of objects that they have launched into space since while launch capabilities are clustered in regions such as the U.S., Russia, and China, the objects such as satellites are made all over the globe.12 Most Advanced Countries in Space Technology12. Republic of Korea (ROK) Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 43 The Republic of Korea (ROK), or South Korea, is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. The country's government invests heavily in advanced technologies such as robotics and biotechnology. Korea's current national space agency is the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), but the country plans to set up a new space agency in mid 2023, called the Korea Aerospace Agency. The South Korean aerospace industry is estimated to sit at $8.4 billion by the end of this year, and up to 2021, it had launched a total of 43 objects into space, out of which 14 are satellites from the KARI.11. Italian Republic Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 52 The Italian Republic is a European country that is most well known for its car brands such as Ferrari and fashion brands such as Versace. Italy is also one of the earliest contributors to space exploration, through the telescope of the renowned polymath Galileo Galilee who provided insights into the Moon, Jupiter, and stars of the Milky Way. Italy's space agency is the Italian Space Agency, and Italy's first contribution to astronautics come as early as 1914 through the writings of Giulio Costanzi on space navigation and nuclear propulsion. The Italian industry has also contributed to manufacturing components for the space shuttle, the International Space Station (ISS), and a variety of other missions such as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) which took place earlier this year and was the first time that humans changed the course of a celestial body. To date, Italy has launched a total of 52 objects into space.10. Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 53The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a Western European country that also has one of the world's highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Its space industry is one of the most unique in the world since instead of others that generally focus on launch capability, human space flight, and satellite manufacturing, it is dedicated to stimulating the field of asteroid mining. Additionally, Luxembourg is also home to one of the largest satellite firms in the world, SES S.A. which was established in 1985 and operates dozens of satellites in geostationary and medium Earth orbits. The Luxembourg Space Agency, in partnership with the European Space Agency, is part of the European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC), a body that aims to develop and create space resource utilization technologies. To date, Luxembourg has launched 53 objects in space.9. Canada Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 82 Canada is a North American country that gained independence from the British parliament in 1982. Canada's space agency is the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). While not commonly known, Canada is one of the first countries in the world that has launched a satellite into space. In fact, it became the third - after the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. - to send a satellite into space that was not built by US or USSR. Canada is a regular contributor to the International Space Station (ISS), and its Canadarm2 has let dozens of vehicles dock on the orbiting body. Canada has also produced 17 astronauts to date and has launched 82 objects into space.8. Federal Republic of Germany Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 114 The Federal Republic of Germany is a European country that is one of the most advanced nations in the world. Its space agency is the German Aerospace Center and it is also one of the largest contributors to the European Space Agency (ESA). Germany is also one of the first countries to have developed rocket propulsion capabilities. Its astronauts have flown on the Space Shuttle, the Russian Soyuz, and the SpaceX Crew Dragon. Additionally, Germany also operates different research projects such as satellites and telescopes. It has launched 114 objects into space so far.European nations are increasing their collaboration with American companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to further their space programs.7. Republic of India Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 127The Republic of India is an Asian country that is one of the largest economies in the world. It also has one of the oldest space agencies, officially dubbed the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and formed in 1969. ISRO operates a space observatory, and its most notable program is the Chandrayaan program. This program has launched a lunar orbiter and a lunar lander that lost communications. ISRO technologies have also been spun off into heart devices, adhesives, and thermal shields. India is also one of the few countries in the world with a rocket program. It launched its first successful rocket in 1980, and since then has developed the capability to target a variety of different orbits such as polar and geosynchronous orbits.6. French Republic Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 130The French Republic, also known as France, is one of the most culturally diverse and powerful nations in the world. Its space agency is called the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES), and the country also contributes to the European Space Agency (ESA). Just as Canada was the first country to launch a satellite not built by the Americans or the Russians, France was the first country that launched a rocket not built by either of the two. French astronauts also regularly fly to the International Space Station (ISS), and the CNES also has an unidentified flying objects (UFO) archive that spans a whopping 100,000 pages. France is also home to the Thales Group, which is one of the largest space companies in the world with a presence in the avionics, satellite communications, and electrical systems for the astronautic industry. France has launched 130 objects into space so far as of 2021 end.As the private sector begins to spend a fortune on space technologies, companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are set to profit from humanity's space endeavors in the long term.

According to MarketsandMarkets.com, just the industrial robotics segment may reach a valuation of $30.8 billion by 2027. If so, this would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3% from the 2022 projection.Further, robotics stocks to buy doesn’t always have to involve massive machinery in the factory production line. For example, in 2021, the global medical robotic systems market size hit around $16.1 billion. Experts project that by 2030, this subsector will generate revenue of $76.4 billion. Therefore, it might pay to get involved early. Below are the stocks to buy as robots begin taking over.TRMBTrimble$52.40GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$91.25ABBABB Ltd.$30.57ROKRockwell Automation$257.96ISRGIntuitive Surgical$271.49FANUYFanuc$14.83KSCPKnightscope$1.53InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTrimble (TRMB)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockBased in Westminster, Colorado, Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) is a software, hardware and services technology company. Per its public profile, Trimble supports global industries in building &amp; construction, agriculture, geospatial, natural resources and utilities, governments, transportation and other sectors. Though the company commands myriad relevancies, Wall Street has been rough on TRMB. On a year-to-date basis, shares tumbled over 36%.Regarding the theme of stocks to buy for robotics technology, Trimble has a joint venture with Boston Dynamics. Together, the two enterprises developed Spot the Robot. Per Trimble’s website, this innovation “facilitates autonomous operation on construction sites and takes advantage of the Spot robot’s unique capabilities to navigate challenging, dynamic, and potentially unsafe environments.”According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Trimble rates as a modestly undervalued investment. Moreover, the company enjoys strong profitability margins. In particular, Trimble’s net margin stands at 12.8%, ranking better than 82% of the competition. Therefore, if robots are your thing, TRMB may be worth consideration for stocks to buy.Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThe tech powerhouse located in Mountain View, California, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns the Google juggernaut. While the enterprise’ bread and butter centers on its dominance of all things internet, it also ventures into other not-directly related segments. One of them is robot technology and it’s truly fascinating stuff. For instance, the company developed automated solutions that can conduct everyday tasks, such as cleaning tables.To be fair, activist investors have targeted Alphabet, criticizing the organization for focusing too much on its Other Bets segment. Instead, concerned financial backers want the Google parent to target businesses that generate income. Given the rough circumstances we’re in, it’s difficult not to sympathize with such exhortations.At the same time, by not investing in Other Bets (such as robotics technology), Alphabet can find itself behind regarding the industries of tomorrow. That’s just not management’s style. Therefore, if you believe in the robotics angle, GOOG/GOOGL could be an interesting idea for contrarian stocks to buy.ABB (ABB)ABB Robotics, Inc. training center in suburban Detroit.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, ABB (NYSE:ABB) specializes in robotics and automation technologies. Per its website, ABB’s solutions connect engineering know-how and software to optimize how things are manufactured, moved, powered and operated. Currently, it severs myriad industries, including automotive, building and infrastructure, hydrocarbons, chemicals, food and beverage and many more.Despite its vast footprint, market pressures weighed on ABB. Since the January opener, shares gave up more than 13% of equity value. At the same time, it’s picking up near-term momentum. In the trailing five days, ABB gained over 3%. And over the past half-year period, shares returned in excess of 19%.Financially, the company brings some positive attributes to the table. Right now, the market prices ABB at 15.7-times trailing-12-month earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 20.3 times. Also, ABB commands a return on equity of 29.5%, implying strong ability to convert equity financing to profits.Rockwell Automation (ROK)professional with manbun working on software on two monitors at a deskSource: ShutterstockBased in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) provides industrial automation whose brands include Allen-Bradley, FactoryTalk software and LifecycleIQ Services. Its operational footprint covers myriad applications, including advanced manufacturing, industrial networks, lifecycle services and even cybersecurity. Thus, on paper, ROK makes for one of the best robotics stocks to buy.However, Wall Street doesn’t quite see it that way. Since the beginning of this year, ROK dropped 20% of equity value. Nevertheless, it’s important for prospective investors not to forget nearer-term momentum. In the trailing month, shares gained 1.6%. And in the trailing half-year period, ROK shot up almost 36%.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for FMV, ROK features a fairly valued investment profile. Some of its positives include a three-year book growth rate of 89.2%, beating out over 98% of the competition. As well, its net margin stands at 12%, better than almost 80% of its rivals.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)a worker with a tablet remotely operates a standalone robot armSource: ShutterstockOne of the more intriguing names among stocks to buy as robots take over the future, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) develops, manufactures, and markets robotic products designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients through minimally invasive surgery, most notably with the da Vinci Surgical System.According to Grand View Research, the global market for minimally invasive surgical instruments will reach a valuation of $28.81 billion by the end of this year. Further, experts project that revenue for the segment will hit $60.65 billion by 2030. Therefore, Intuitive Surgical is well positioned for exceptional relevance.For contrarians, the compelling nature of ISRG centers on its red ink. Since the January opener, shares dropped nearly 22% of equity value. However, the market appears to have caught onto the opportunity. In the trailing month, ISRG gained nearly 9%. And in the trailing half-year period, ISRG popped up over 47%. Combined with the company’s zero-debt profile, ISRG ranks among the stocks to buy as robots dominate the medical space.Fanuc (FANUY)a computer rendering of Miso Robotics's ""Flippy"" robotSource: Miso RoboticsBased in Japan, Fanuc (OTCMKTS:FANUY) may be traded over the counter. However, don’t let that fool you as it’s one of the biggest names among stocks to buy for a robotic future. First, the company commands a market capitalization of 4.24 trillion yen (about the equivalent of $31.3 billion using the at-time-of-writing exchange rate).Second, carries significant relevance for anyone interested in robots as an investment vehicle. Per its website, Fanuc is the world’s leading supplier of automation for manufacturing including robotics, CNCs [computerized numerical controls] and motion control.Fundamentally, Fanuc deserves consideration as one of the robotics stocks to buy because of the implications regarding the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Per Precedence Research, industrial IoT reached a market size of $326.1 billion last year. However, by 2030, experts project that the segment could command a valuation of $1.74 trillion.Enticingly, not too many folks in the market believe in Fanuc. Shares slipped nearly 28% since the start of the year. However, this dynamic might spell opportunity for the contrarian.Knightscope (KSCP)A Knightscope robot with a Samsung logo patrols the Samsung corporate campus.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comWhile the riskiest name on this list for stocks to buy in anticipation of robots taking over society, Knightscope (NASDAQ:KSCP) actually lives up to this billing quite literally. Billed as a security camera and robotics firm, Knightscope specializes in the manufacturing and deployment of autonomous data robots.

By utilizing robots as the first point of contact regarding security protocols, Knightscope can help mitigate social tensions.Though incredibly intriguing, the problem is that KSCP is also incredibly risky.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Space Technology. Space exploration is one of the hottest topics these days. As compared to the decade between 2010 and 2020, interest in the sector is at an all time high globally. Before now, the U.S. Space Shuttle program had regularly piqued the attention of the American nation, but the only true global space movement occurred in the 1950s and 1960s when the U.S. and the then U.S.S.R. competed for the opportunity to first place a human on Earth orbit and then on the Moon. The U.S. and Soviet Russia were close rivals, with the latter being the first to send humans to space and make a lunar landing. But the former stole the ultimate crown when it landed astronauts on the Moon in 1969 through the Apollo program.The three and a half years between 1969 and 1972 is the only time period when humans have made their way to and across the Moon. America is the only country that has walked our closest celestial neighbor, as the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. and the relative infancy of other space programs ensured that this remarkable technological achievement remained out of reach of other countries.Fast forward to 2022, and it is appearing as if the U.S. will once again become the first to go to the Moon. NASA's Artemis program was launched in November 2022, and the Orion spacecraft successfully completed its journey around the Moon to land on Earth in December 2022. However, before we get to that, NASA is not the reason space has become a hot topic these days. Instead, the growing popularity is due to the private sector rising up to meet government agencies in establishing a regular rocket launch cadence. At the top of this list of firms is Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), whose Falcon 9 medium lift launch vehicle, or rocket, is capable of partial reuse through the remarkable feat of autonomously landing in the sea and on the ground. Watching a 135 feet tall rocket land regularly catches the public attention unlike anything else, and other firms, such as Rocket Lab, have also started to follow in SpaceX's footsteps when it comes to reusability.Story continuesThe space industry itself is based on thousands of firms that operate at different levels. These range from mega firms such as Boeing, which manufactures rockets, to those that make engines, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne, and others that provide systems and subsystems such as space suits, avionics, electrical systems, heat shields, and life support equipment.Some major players operating in the space technology include The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).12 Most Advanced Countries in Space TechnologyPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology We have ranked the countries by the total number of objects that they have launched into space since while launch capabilities are clustered in regions such as the U.S., Russia, and China, the objects such as satellites are made all over the globe.12 Most Advanced Countries in Space Technology12. Republic of Korea (ROK) Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 43 The Republic of Korea (ROK), or South Korea, is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. The country's government invests heavily in advanced technologies such as robotics and biotechnology. Korea's current national space agency is the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), but the country plans to set up a new space agency in mid 2023, called the Korea Aerospace Agency. The South Korean aerospace industry is estimated to sit at $8.4 billion by the end of this year, and up to 2021, it had launched a total of 43 objects into space, out of which 14 are satellites from the KARI.11. Italian Republic Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 52 The Italian Republic is a European country that is most well known for its car brands such as Ferrari and fashion brands such as Versace. Italy is also one of the earliest contributors to space exploration, through the telescope of the renowned polymath Galileo Galilee who provided insights into the Moon, Jupiter, and stars of the Milky Way. Italy's space agency is the Italian Space Agency, and Italy's first contribution to astronautics come as early as 1914 through the writings of Giulio Costanzi on space navigation and nuclear propulsion. The Italian industry has also contributed to manufacturing components for the space shuttle, the International Space Station (ISS), and a variety of other missions such as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) which took place earlier this year and was the first time that humans changed the course of a celestial body. To date, Italy has launched a total of 52 objects into space.10. Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 53The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a Western European country that also has one of the world's highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Its space industry is one of the most unique in the world since instead of others that generally focus on launch capability, human space flight, and satellite manufacturing, it is dedicated to stimulating the field of asteroid mining. Additionally, Luxembourg is also home to one of the largest satellite firms in the world, SES S.A. which was established in 1985 and operates dozens of satellites in geostationary and medium Earth orbits. The Luxembourg Space Agency, in partnership with the European Space Agency, is part of the European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC), a body that aims to develop and create space resource utilization technologies. To date, Luxembourg has launched 53 objects in space.9. Canada Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 82 Canada is a North American country that gained independence from the British parliament in 1982. Canada's space agency is the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). While not commonly known, Canada is one of the first countries in the world that has launched a satellite into space. In fact, it became the third - after the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. - to send a satellite into space that was not built by US or USSR. Canada is a regular contributor to the International Space Station (ISS), and its Canadarm2 has let dozens of vehicles dock on the orbiting body. Canada has also produced 17 astronauts to date and has launched 82 objects into space.8. Federal Republic of Germany Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 114 The Federal Republic of Germany is a European country that is one of the most advanced nations in the world. Its space agency is the German Aerospace Center and it is also one of the largest contributors to the European Space Agency (ESA). Germany is also one of the first countries to have developed rocket propulsion capabilities. Its astronauts have flown on the Space Shuttle, the Russian Soyuz, and the SpaceX Crew Dragon. Additionally, Germany also operates different research projects such as satellites and telescopes. It has launched 114 objects into space so far.European nations are increasing their collaboration with American companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to further their space programs.7. Republic of India Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 127The Republic of India is an Asian country that is one of the largest economies in the world. It also has one of the oldest space agencies, officially dubbed the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and formed in 1969. ISRO operates a space observatory, and its most notable program is the Chandrayaan program. This program has launched a lunar orbiter and a lunar lander that lost communications. ISRO technologies have also been spun off into heart devices, adhesives, and thermal shields. India is also one of the few countries in the world with a rocket program. It launched its first successful rocket in 1980, and since then has developed the capability to target a variety of different orbits such as polar and geosynchronous orbits.6. French Republic Number of Objects Launched as of 2021: 130The French Republic, also known as France, is one of the most culturally diverse and powerful nations in the world. Its space agency is called the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES), and the country also contributes to the European Space Agency (ESA). Just as Canada was the first country to launch a satellite not built by the Americans or the Russians, France was the first country that launched a rocket not built by either of the two. French astronauts also regularly fly to the International Space Station (ISS), and the CNES also has an unidentified flying objects (UFO) archive that spans a whopping 100,000 pages. France is also home to the Thales Group, which is one of the largest space companies in the world with a presence in the avionics, satellite communications, and electrical systems for the astronautic industry. France has launched 130 objects into space so far as of 2021 end.As the private sector begins to spend a fortune on space technologies, companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are set to profit from humanity's space endeavors in the long term.

69,768eb4c8-ca71-33d6-a81b-0c3167cc937a,CI,2022-12-19,Cigna Corporation's (NYSE:CI) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporations-nyse-ci-stock-130018476.html,1671454818,STORY,['CI'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Cigna's (NYSE:CI) stock increased significantly by 14% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Cigna's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Cigna How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:15% = US$6.7b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cigna's Earnings Growth And 15% ROETo start with, Cigna's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%. This probably goes some way in explaining Cigna's significant 23% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 16%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Cigna Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Cigna's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.3%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Additionally, Cigna has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Cigna's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

You can skip our detailed analysis of factors leading to a brand becoming overrated and its consequences and head directly to 5 Most Overrated Companies and Brands Heading into 2023. Factors Leading to Brands Becoming OverratedBrand-recognition strategies can be highly effective in increasing revenue. However, a brand can become a victim of its own success due to factors that can be avoided. These include complacency, rigid bureaucratic frameworks that arise as a result of scaling and other corrosive business practices like bad customer service.However, one core factor has specifically to do with luxury goods. Luxury companies price their products on value-based pricing, which is tied around their wealthy customers’ perceived value of their products for social status. McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, stated that the luxury apparel industry is well-placed in the ongoing market downturn to outperform the rest of the clothing industry. It puts the CAGR of luxury fashion at 5-10% in the US in 2023, since its core market comprises affluent customers mostly insulated from the impact of rising interest rates and inflation. However, its Consumer Pulse survey also showed that more people from the luxury brands’ peripheral market have switched from top-tier brands to private-label products for lower prices than at any other time since the Covid pandemic began. Impact of Brand ReviewsOverrated brands do not directly suffer from declining revenue, at-least in the short to medium term. What they directly result in, is bad customer reviews. Reviews play an important role in the global economy, especially in the American economy where consumers are highly inclined to give their feedback about products they buy and use other people's feedback while making a buying decision.A Quality Logo Product survey shows 85% of people trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Bad reviews can lead to a halt in the growth of customer-base and then eventually, dwindling reputation may even lead to a decline in revenue due to customer alienation and the background inflation rate.  Story continuesAccording to data from Statista, 92% of potential customers are less likely to buy from a negatively reviewed business. The reviews for most of these overrated brands and companies can be checked out on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L), among others.Photo by Erik Mclean on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe’ve ranked brands and companies based on the review ratings from Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L), a major consumer-review platform, where consumers rate a company with stars, with 5-stars being the best and 1 star being the worst. We’ve also accounted for customer service and general sentiment around the brands in question. For major brands, we’ve also discussed consumer survey results from sources like American Affluence Research Center and also considered brands from the book Obsessive Branding Disorder, by journalist Lucas Conley.Let’s dive in. Here's the 15 most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.15. Champion, by Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)Trustpilot Rating: 2.5 (Poor)Champion is a sportswear clothing brand owned and operated by the US apparel company Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI). Based on its Trustpilot reviews categorized as “poor”, the brand has quality control as well as customer service issues. Some other customers claimed that the products they had ordered from their store were never delivered. Champion is one of the largest brands of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) which the latter acquired in 2016 for $90 million. 14. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Trustpilot Rating: 2.4 (Poor)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a Seattle-based multinational chain of coffee houses. The company is a household name due to its nearly 36,000 coffee houses across the globe. It’s penetrated in pop-culture as well, featuring in movies like Mean Girls. However, it has largely fallen out of favor with consumers, who claim that it is overrated. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a poor rating of 2.4 on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L) based on 1,565 reviews. Majority of reviewers complained about low maintenance, mediocre quality and unreasonable cost. Despite that, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is growing fairly well. Its YoY growth for fiscal year 2022 was 11% from the previous year.It's largely due to the fact that famous (not necessarily popular) brands often end up becoming status symbols. For instance, a University-of-Leicester study has discovered that consumption of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) food and beverages by the Chinese urban middle class is associated with status rather than quality of their products.  13. Dunkin’ DonutsTrustpilot Rating: 2.3 (Poor)Dunkin’ Donuts is an American doughnut and coffee company based in Canton, Massachusetts. It has a poor rating of 2.2 based on 181 reviews on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L). Dunkin’ Donuts has over 11,300 restaurants worldwide, with 8,500 in the US alone, making it a prominent brand. However, consumer reviews paint a rather negative picture, with many reviewers complaining about the quality of food, sanitation and customer service on Trustpilot. Dunkin’ Donuts has also been featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder, as an example of an overrated brand.12. GucciTrustpilot Rating: 2.1 (Poor)Gucci is a high-end fashion house headquartered in Florence, Italy. The company designs and sells products like luxury apparel, handbags and wallets, shoes, jewelry as well as watches and many other luxury items. However, 1,217 reviews on Trustpilot put Gucci’s rating at a poor 2.1, with a good majority of reviewers complaining about customer service issues, followed by product quality relative to cost.Gucci's products can be bought from their official store as well as from platforms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Target Corporation (NASDAQ:TGT), eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).11. Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)Trustpilot Rating: 2.0 (Poor)Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is a world-famous company of women’s undergarments based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.  The company has close to 1,350 retail outlets across the world. Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is known for charging a premium on their products, owing to its luxury market. Its products’ prices rose by 83% in 2021 from  the mid-2019, according to a UBS report.Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is another brand on the list of most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023 that has been described as overrated by Lucas Conley.10. PradaTrustpilot Rating: 1.9 (Poor)Prada, owned and operated by Prada S.p.A (PRDSY) and based in Milan, Italy, is another household name in the luxury market. It is one of the oldest fashion houses in the world, dating back to 1913. Prada designs and sells luxury clothes, handbags and footwear among other luxury items. It has a poor rating of 1.9 on Trustpilot9. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV)Trustpilot Rating: 1.9 (Poor)Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is one of the largest airlines in the United States. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is yet another company to be featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder as an overrated company. Being also the largest low cost carrier in the world, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) naturally became very prominent with customers around the world and especially in the US. However, a PR disaster from 2008 dented the company’s reputation among consumers.The airline allegedly kept flying 46 airplanes for over 60,000 flights without inspections for fuselage cracks, as reported by New York Times. This resulted in a hefty $10 million fine by the Federal Aviation Authority.It is the ninth on the list of most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.8. SupremeTrustpilot Rating: 1.8 (Poor)Supreme is a lifestyle clothing brand based in New York City and is one of the most overrated brands heading into 2023. Based on over 400 reviews on Trustpilot, the company has a poor rating of 1.8. Most customers have complained about their lack of maintenance of their website which results in a poor shopping experience. Others have highlighted their “poor” customer service. 7. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Trustpilot Rating: 1.7 (Bad)The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is an American multinational apparel and accessories brand. It has over 2,800 stores across the world, to give you a perspective on its widespread prominence. That said, The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is also thought of as overrated. It was another brand that was featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder as an overrated company. It has a bad rating of 1.7 based on 430+ consumer reviews on Trustpilot. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has largely been criticized for its quality and cost but most importantly for its customer service and strict return-policies. 6. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Trustpilot Rating: 1.7 (Bad)NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an American manufacturer of sports-related apparel and accessories and really needs no further introduction given the business clout the company enjoys all over the world. But, the brand has received overwhelmingly negative reviews on Trustpilot, from close to 6,000 consumers, leading to NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) having a bad rating of 1.7.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Overrated Companies and Brands Heading into 2023.   Suggested articles:15 Most Well-Known Clothing Brands in the World15 Biggest Jewelry Companies in the World12 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: none. 15 Most Overrated Companies and Brands Heading into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE: PFE) and LianBio (Nasdaq: LIAN), a biotechnology company dedicated to bringing innovative medicines to patients in China and other major Asian markets, today announced that Pfizer opted in to the right to develop and commercialize sisunatovir, a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) therapeutic candidate, in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore pursuant to the companies’ existing strategic collaboration to expand patient access to novel therapeutics in Greater China.Sisunatovir is an investigational, orally administered fusion inhibitor designed to block RSV replication by inhibiting F-mediated fusion with the host cell. Sisunatovir is being evaluated for the potential treatment of RSV infection in pediatric and adult patients.“Like LianBio, Pfizer recognizes the promise of sisunatovir to address significant treatment gaps for patient populations vulnerable to severe complications of RSV,” said Yizhe Wang, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of LianBio. “During typical RSV seasons, more than 400,000 pediatric and elderly patients in China are hospitalized with RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections. Pfizer is a leader in advancing research and development for RSV vaccines and therapeutics, and their expertise studying different modalities of treatment is expected to be instrumental in bringing a new therapeutic option to as many patients in need as possible.""Story continuesIn June 2022, Pfizer acquired ReViral Ltd. and its portfolio of RSV therapeutic candidates with the exception of development and commercialization rights for sisunatovir in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore, which LianBio had previously in-licensed from ReViral in March 2021.“At Pfizer, we are committed to advancing potentially critical vaccines and therapies to help address significant unmet need in infectious diseases around the world, including RSV, and we’re pleased that this ongoing collaboration with LianBio has the potential to provide more patients with access to a much-needed treatment,” said Jean-Christophe Pointeau, China President for Pfizer Global Biopharma Business. “We believe that, if clinically successful and approved, sisunatovir may help change the standard of care for patients with RSV disease, for whom treatment options are currently limited.”Under the terms of Pfizer’s opt-in to sisunatovir rights, LianBio will receive a $20 million upfront payment, to be released from previously restricted cash paid by Pfizer to LianBio in 2020 under the companies’ existing strategic collaboration. Additionally, LianBio is eligible to receive up to $135 million in potential development and commercial milestone payments and tiered low single digit percent of sisunatovir net sales in the territories. Pfizer will assume all development and commercial activities and costs in the region and will release LianBio from its royalty and milestone obligations for sisunatovir.About SisunatovirSisunatovir is an investigational orally administered fusion inhibitor designed to block RSV replication by inhibiting F-mediated fusion with the host cell. It has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It significantly reduced viral load in a phase 2 RSV human challenge study in healthy adults and is currently being evaluated in a global phase 2 clinical study in children.Further clinical studies in adults and children are being planned and will be initiated following feedback from regulatory agencies.About the Pfizer and LianBio Strategic Collaboration In 2020, LianBio and Pfizer entered into a collaboration aimed at developing and commercializing transformative pharmaceutical products in Greater China leveraging both LianBio’s and Pfizer’s clinical development, regulatory and commercial expertise. Under the terms of the collaboration, Pfizer will contribute up to $70M of non-dilutive capital toward in-licensing, development and commercialization. At LianBio’s discretion, products are presented to Pfizer, and Pfizer can opt-in to development and commercial rights. The first program under development as part of the Pfizer and LianBio strategic collaboration is sisunatovir, an investigational therapeutic for the treatment of RSV in pediatric and adult patients.Pfizer Inc: Breakthroughs that change patients’ livesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Insiders purchase with the hope of seeing their investments increase in value over time. However, due to recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth US$2.3m, which is not great.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PayPal HoldingsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Vice President of Global Sales, Peggy Alford, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$97.82 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$69.26). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Peggy Alford was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 33.36k shares worth US$3.7m. But insiders sold 21.79k shares worth US$2.1m. In total, PayPal Holdings insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.1% of PayPal Holdings shares, worth about US$99m.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Battery Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. As the automobile sector transitions towards electric vehicles, battery demand is increasing. The battery industry will advance due to gigafactory construction, improving supply chains, and talent acquisition. Battery demand is forecasted to grow by nearly 30%, reaching 4,500 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year worldwide by 2030. The battery value chain is anticipated to increase by ten times between 2020 and 2030 to reach annual revenues of as much as $410 billion.In 2030, China is forecasted to be the largest market for lithium-ion batteries, with 40% of the global demand concentrated in the Asian country. About 90 percent of the total batteries will be demanded by mobility applications, primarily electric vehicles. Most OEMs and battery manufacturers have constructed or are aiming to initiate gigafactories for the production of lithium-ion batteries at scale, either independently or via joint ventures. The global lithium-ion market is expected to be worth $135.1 billion by 2031, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 13.1% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2031. Some of the best battery stocks to buy heading into 2023 include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). Our Methodology We selected the following battery stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Battery Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023Photo by Kumpan Electric on UnsplashBest Battery Stocks To Buy Heading Into 202310. Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) was incorporated in 2006 and is based in Stafford, Texas. The company designs, develops, and manufactures battery systems for electric vehicles and energy storage systems, offering a range of cell chemistries, such as lithium titanate oxide, lithium iron phosphate, and nickel manganese cobalt. Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) expects year-over-year revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 to be in the range of 35% to 40%. Story continuesOn December 7, Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) announced that it had won a contract to provide a utility-scale battery energy storage system to a U.S. customer. Shipments are expected to arrive at the project site in 2023 and the commercial operation date is anticipated to be in 2024.Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch on August 18 initiated coverage of Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) with an Outperform rating and an $8 price target. The analyst views Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) as a ""pioneering battery material company, innovating around the molecular structure of critical battery composition to improve battery performance and reduce material use."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, 11 hedge funds were bullish on Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 12 funds in the prior quarter. The collective stakes held by elite funds in the third quarter amounted to $24 million, compared to $28.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) is one of the best battery stocks to consider for next year. 9. Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) is a technology company that works to develop energy and transportation solutions. It operates through two business units, Truck and Energy. The Truck segment manufactures and commercializes battery hydrogen-electric and battery-electric semi-trucks and the Energy segment constructs a network of hydrogen fueling stations, as well as offers BEV charging solutions. On December 15, Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) and Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) announced that they have agreed to a strategic relationship focused on advancing the hydrogen economy. The green hydrogen supply agreement will begin on January 1, 2023. Plug Power will provide up to 125 tons per day of green hydrogen to Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) as its hydrogen production network continues to come online. The agreement forecasts 125 TPD volume by the conclusion of 2026, with 80% under a take-or-pay contract.Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne on November 4 maintained an Outperform rating on Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $10 from $12.50. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 11 hedge funds held stakes in Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA), compared to 13 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent position holder in the company, with 3 million shares worth $10.6 million.  8. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) operates as a resource company in the United States and Argentina, primarily exploring for lithium deposits. The company was incorporated in 2007 and is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. In the beginning of November, Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) announced plans to separate its North American and Argentine business units into two independent public companies. It is one of the best battery stocks to buy for next year. The lithium miner has several ongoing projects in the U.S. and Argentina while lithium faces potential supply shortages due to the huge EV demand, which will benefit the stock. On December 15, Piper Sandler analyst Charles Neivert reiterated an Overweight rating on Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $36 from $38. As a result of the high electric vehicle costs and a slight easing in the short-term lithium demand growth rate, the analyst modestly lowered earnings estimates for the company. However, the new target still factors in meaningful upside for the stock since lithium ""will essentially be sold out for the foreseeable future,"" the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 14 hedge funds were long Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC), compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter. Jay Chen’s Himension Capital held the leading stake in the company, comprising 3.26 million shares worth $85.6 million. Here is what Massif Capital has to say about Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“Lithium Americas: The volatility noted above in LAC has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position. At the current time, we are short calls on LAC, as we have done multiple times throughout the position’s life, expiring on May 21, 2021, at a $17.5 and $22.5 strike price. The volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money, and the underlying equity gets called away from us. The thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point, there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre-selling the stock we would have sold anyway.High levels of volatility positively impact the price of options, increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls. To date, we have sold covered calls on LAC that have expired worthless four times, yielding a roughly 7% return on the equity position’s current value of 71 bps for the portfolio overall. The outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration. If they do, the covered call trades on LAC will result in us owning the shares with committed capital of -$0.28 per share.Although we believe in the fullness of time LAC warrants a $30+ valuation, the prices achieved in early January of this year were not justified by the underlying fundamentals. Some will argue we should have sold down our position. We had already established our option positions and believe LAC is an emerging major in the lithium mining industry. Thus, we decided to maintain the position unchanged. Although still relatively high, the current $15 per share valuation is not crazy compared to where we think the firm should be trading based on fundamentals, so we are no longer overly concerned with the position as is.LAC management also took advantage of the volatility issuing stock on January 22 for $22 a share. The ~$400 million in proceeds will be used to develop Thacker Pass, the US-based clay lithium deposit, which will likely be the largest producing Lithium mine in America when turned on. In our opinion, the stock issuance could not have come at a better time. LAC management has advanced the project through various development stages (de-risking), but with the share issuance, they have significantly reduced the need to bring in an outside partner to develop the asset as the first phase of the project is expected to cost roughly $581 million. After-tax and at an 8% discount rate, the Thacker Pass project’s present value is approximately $2.6 billion (the firm’s current market capitalization is $1.5 billion). Although the share issuance was dilutive, increasing the total shares by 17%, we believe it will, in the long run, prove a forward-looking, value-additive decision by management.The lithium market remains an area of interest and focus for us. This reflects our belief that the most exciting investment opportunities to capture secular trends in EV’s and batteries are found upstream in the mining industry. It is also a reflection that there is a greater diversity of lithium investment opportunities relative to other battery metals.”7. Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Louisville, Colorado. The company is engaged in the development and commercialization of all-solid-state battery cells and solid electrolyte materials for the battery-powered electric vehicle market in the United States. It is one of the premier battery stocks to buy heading into 2023. Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP)’s Q3 revenue of $2.81 million climbed 346% year-over-year, beating market estimates by $2.07 million. Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) expects to have total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term investments of between $460 million to $470 million at the end of this year.On December 14, Citi analyst P.J. Juvekar initiated coverage of Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) with a Neutral rating and a $3 price target. Solid-state batteries, while promising, face a challenging path to commercialization by 2026, with potential for delays and technology risk, the analyst told investors in a research note. Longer term, there is no doubt that the Inflation Redaction Act bill will quicken EV adoption in the U.S. and automakers will be keen to bring new technologies like solid state, noted the analyst. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 15 hedge funds were long Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP), compared to 17 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group held the largest position in the company, consisting of 688,515 shares worth $3.6 million. 6.

81,efd5abfc-6c8d-3c66-acd5-fd94a6d800a8,MKC,2022-12-19,The 7 Hottest Food Stocks to Own for 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-hottest-food-stocks-own-180702361.html,1671127622,STORY,"['BRBR', 'MKC-V', 'PEP', 'HRL', 'COST', 'AVO', 'HSY']","[Food stocks have regained some favor in 2022. Over the past few years, many investors passed over the sector. After all, food tends to be a slowly growing industry that may not hold the glamor or appeal of, say, tech stocks. However, food stocks have dramatically outperformed many other sectors in 2022. That isn’t too surprising because the food and beverage sector is known for being a safe harbor during market storms. Since that’s the case, it’s a great time to look at the seven hottest food stocks.But there’s a lot more to food stocks than just their defensiveness. Many of the leading food companies have dramatically outperformed versus the S&amp;P 500 over the longer term. The combination of food makers’ recession-resistant businesses, high profit margins, and strong brands tend to lead to superior returns.HSYHershey$233PEPPepsiCo$179HRLHormel Foods$45.60MCKMcCormick$368BRBRBellring Brands$24.65AVOMission Produce$15COSTCostco$466InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHershey (HSY)The entrance to the Hershey factory in downtown Hershey, Pennsylvania. HSY stock.Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.comConfection and snack maker Hershey (NYSE:HSY) has been one of 2022’s more surprising winners. The shares have rallied 21% in 2022 and reached new all-time highs recently.The company’s success isn’t hard to explain. The American chocolate sector has limited competition, with Hershey and Mars holding most of the U.S. chocolate  market. Additionally, people have strong taste preferences when it comes to chocolate. That generally protects firms like Hershey from facing cheaper, store-brand competition. That, in turn, has allowed Hershey to hike prices quickly during the current inflationary shock, protecting the firm’s profit margins.Hershey’s best-in-class earnings results and operational momentum have allowed HSY stock to stand out even during this bear market. In addition to Hershey’s strong chocolate business, it has acquired several snack brands in recent years which give the company additional growth avenues, particularly with younger consumers.Story continuesPepsico (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comMost investors probably know Pepsico (NYSE:PEP) for its soft-drink business. However, there’s more to Pepsico than just soda. The company also owns Frito-Lay, which is one of the world’s most dominant snack businesses.The addition of chips and other savory snacks has given Pepsico a tremendous second lever for growth. There are natural synergies from owning both beverages and snacks, in terms of supply chains, marketing, and cross-promotion. More broadly, the snack business has given Pepsico a clearer long-term outlook than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), since Pepsico is less reliant on sugary-drink sales for its profits.Pepsico has shown tremendous consistency over the years. PEP stock has appreciated at an  annualized rate  of over 11% in the past three, five, and ten years, respectively. Pepsico is rarely flashy, but the company consistently generates value for its shareholders, leading to strong and steady returns by PEP stock.Hormel Foods (HRL)Grocery shelf of SPAM cans made by Hormel (HRL)Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.comHormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a Minnesota-based packaged foods company that was founded way back in 1891. The company’s fortunes were long tied to products such as Spam, its canned-meat product. Investors might think Hormel is behind the times, given its history.However, Hormel has overhauled its portfolio to prepare for future decades. The company is now a leader in all sorts of healthier and more fashionable proteins. Specifically, Hormel has invested heavily in deli meats, turkey, nuts, nut butters, guacamole, and even plant-based meat alternatives. Hormel has a protein of every type and price point to meet the tastes of the next generation of consumers.While Hormel has a forward-looking assortment of brands, it manages its business conservatively, as it tends to maintain a strong balance sheet with low amounts of debt. That has allowed Hormel to become a Dividend King. In other words,  it has raised its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years, thanks to its continuing financial strength.In 2002, HRL stock was trading for $6 a share on a split-adjusted basis. Nowadays the shares are up to over $45 each.  A strong portfolio of food brands paired with a superior management team can make a great deal of money for investors.McCormick (MKC)A steak surrounded by flame on a grill.Source: Joshua Resnick / Shutterstock.comMcCormick (NYSE:MKC) is America’s leading purveyor of spices and flavors. The company naturally has a strong business because  grocery stores don’t want to carry multiple brands of such simple spices as bottled black pepper, vanilla, and cinnamon. Throw in McCormick’s deep supply chain and its ability to obtain spices globally, and the company’s business is hard to disrupt.However, there’s more to McCormick than spices. It has become one of the hottest food stocks, in more ways than one, thanks to its various acquisitions in the hot-sauces category. McCormick has purchased Frank’s and Cholula, among other brands, in recent years.Hot sauce is one of the fastest-growing categories within packaged foods, with the global market expected to grow at an annual pace of 7.9% going forward. That’s far faster growth than that of most food products, whose sales tend to only keep pace with population growth and inflation.McCormick has done a great job positioning its portfolio to benefit from millennials’ interest in more unique cuisines and distinct flavors. And, after several years of MCK stock being relatively flat, its shares should be set for another leg higher in 2023.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comAnother way to get exposure to the food industry is through  grocery stores. And there have arguably been few hotter food stocks over the past few years than Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). Indeed, COST stock has rallied more than 150% over the past five years.The pandemic helped highlight Costco’s various strengths. The company is known for treating its employees well and providing them with wages and benefits well above those of its direct peers. That strategy proved invaluable in 2020 when it was hard to retain qualified staff. Because of its approach, Costco had a tremendous edge when it came to keeping its stores open, clean, and humming along.Costco also tends to fare well during periods of high inflation. The company’s differentiated business model, featuring membership charges and rock-bottom prices, has given consumers confidence that their dollars can stretch farther when they shop at Costco. The company’s gas stations have proven to be another big competitive edge as gas prices have soared throughout much of 2022.But COST stock is changing hands for around 34 times its forward earnings today. That’s admittedly not cheap. However, Costco’s exemplary, long-term returns and continued strong, long-term outlook into the mid-2020s make Costco a reasonable food stock even at its current, loftier valuation.Bellring Brands (BRBR)7 Food Stocks to Buy NowSource: Shutterstock.comBellring Brands (NYSE:BRBR) is another food company that makes a point of appealing to younger consumers. Primarily, Bellring operates in the protein space.The company has a three-sided approach to protein. It sells protein beverages under the Premier Protein label, it markets Dymatize, which is a line of protein powder, and Bellring also sells its high-protein PowerBar.In this way, the company can reach protein-focused consumers regardless of whether they want to buy bars, shakes, or protein powder. In recent years, we’ve seen more interest in reducing consumption of carbohydrates while prioritizing protein consumption. Add in increased focus on fitness, and Bellring should enjoy a strong growth in the coming years.Mission Produce (AVO)Source: ShutterstockRounding out the list is fresh foods leader Mission Produce (NASDAQ:AVO). The company is a dominant player in the worldwide avocado market, with operations spanning many countries. Mission is also involved in the mango business.Avocados have grown in popularity in recent years. Guacamole is a popular snack food, of course. Additionally, younger consumers have increasingly turned to avocado oil  as a healthier substitute to butter or vegetable oil.A recent report suggested that the global avocado market will grow at an annualized rate of 7% throughout the next decade.The stock completed its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020, and its shares quickly doubled, reaching a peak in the mid-$20s. Now, however, the stock has pulled back to $15, creating a more tasty entry point.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held long positions in HSY, HRL, and MKC stock.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.3% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 20% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Intuitive Surgical, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuitive Surgical. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Intuitive Surgical already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Intuitive Surgical, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intuitive Surgical. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 6.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Intuitive Surgical, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$427m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

According to MarketsandMarkets.com, just the industrial robotics segment may reach a valuation of $30.8 billion by 2027. If so, this would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3% from the 2022 projection.Further, robotics stocks to buy doesn’t always have to involve massive machinery in the factory production line. For example, in 2021, the global medical robotic systems market size hit around $16.1 billion. Experts project that by 2030, this subsector will generate revenue of $76.4 billion. Therefore, it might pay to get involved early. Below are the stocks to buy as robots begin taking over.TRMBTrimble$52.40GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$91.25ABBABB Ltd.$30.57ROKRockwell Automation$257.96ISRGIntuitive Surgical$271.49FANUYFanuc$14.83KSCPKnightscope$1.53InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTrimble (TRMB)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockBased in Westminster, Colorado, Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) is a software, hardware and services technology company. Per its public profile, Trimble supports global industries in building &amp; construction, agriculture, geospatial, natural resources and utilities, governments, transportation and other sectors. Though the company commands myriad relevancies, Wall Street has been rough on TRMB. On a year-to-date basis, shares tumbled over 36%.Regarding the theme of stocks to buy for robotics technology, Trimble has a joint venture with Boston Dynamics. Together, the two enterprises developed Spot the Robot. Per Trimble’s website, this innovation “facilitates autonomous operation on construction sites and takes advantage of the Spot robot’s unique capabilities to navigate challenging, dynamic, and potentially unsafe environments.”According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Trimble rates as a modestly undervalued investment. Moreover, the company enjoys strong profitability margins. In particular, Trimble’s net margin stands at 12.8%, ranking better than 82% of the competition. Therefore, if robots are your thing, TRMB may be worth consideration for stocks to buy.Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThe tech powerhouse located in Mountain View, California, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns the Google juggernaut. While the enterprise’ bread and butter centers on its dominance of all things internet, it also ventures into other not-directly related segments. One of them is robot technology and it’s truly fascinating stuff. For instance, the company developed automated solutions that can conduct everyday tasks, such as cleaning tables.To be fair, activist investors have targeted Alphabet, criticizing the organization for focusing too much on its Other Bets segment. Instead, concerned financial backers want the Google parent to target businesses that generate income. Given the rough circumstances we’re in, it’s difficult not to sympathize with such exhortations.At the same time, by not investing in Other Bets (such as robotics technology), Alphabet can find itself behind regarding the industries of tomorrow. That’s just not management’s style. Therefore, if you believe in the robotics angle, GOOG/GOOGL could be an interesting idea for contrarian stocks to buy.ABB (ABB)ABB Robotics, Inc. training center in suburban Detroit.Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, ABB (NYSE:ABB) specializes in robotics and automation technologies. Per its website, ABB’s solutions connect engineering know-how and software to optimize how things are manufactured, moved, powered and operated. Currently, it severs myriad industries, including automotive, building and infrastructure, hydrocarbons, chemicals, food and beverage and many more.Despite its vast footprint, market pressures weighed on ABB. Since the January opener, shares gave up more than 13% of equity value. At the same time, it’s picking up near-term momentum. In the trailing five days, ABB gained over 3%. And over the past half-year period, shares returned in excess of 19%.Financially, the company brings some positive attributes to the table. Right now, the market prices ABB at 15.7-times trailing-12-month earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 20.3 times. Also, ABB commands a return on equity of 29.5%, implying strong ability to convert equity financing to profits.Rockwell Automation (ROK)professional with manbun working on software on two monitors at a deskSource: ShutterstockBased in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) provides industrial automation whose brands include Allen-Bradley, FactoryTalk software and LifecycleIQ Services. Its operational footprint covers myriad applications, including advanced manufacturing, industrial networks, lifecycle services and even cybersecurity. Thus, on paper, ROK makes for one of the best robotics stocks to buy.However, Wall Street doesn’t quite see it that way. Since the beginning of this year, ROK dropped 20% of equity value. Nevertheless, it’s important for prospective investors not to forget nearer-term momentum. In the trailing month, shares gained 1.6%. And in the trailing half-year period, ROK shot up almost 36%.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for FMV, ROK features a fairly valued investment profile. Some of its positives include a three-year book growth rate of 89.2%, beating out over 98% of the competition. As well, its net margin stands at 12%, better than almost 80% of its rivals.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)a worker with a tablet remotely operates a standalone robot armSource: ShutterstockOne of the more intriguing names among stocks to buy as robots take over the future, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) develops, manufactures, and markets robotic products designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients through minimally invasive surgery, most notably with the da Vinci Surgical System.According to Grand View Research, the global market for minimally invasive surgical instruments will reach a valuation of $28.81 billion by the end of this year. Further, experts project that revenue for the segment will hit $60.65 billion by 2030. Therefore, Intuitive Surgical is well positioned for exceptional relevance.For contrarians, the compelling nature of ISRG centers on its red ink. Since the January opener, shares dropped nearly 22% of equity value. However, the market appears to have caught onto the opportunity. In the trailing month, ISRG gained nearly 9%. And in the trailing half-year period, ISRG popped up over 47%. Combined with the company’s zero-debt profile, ISRG ranks among the stocks to buy as robots dominate the medical space.Fanuc (FANUY)a computer rendering of Miso Robotics's ""Flippy"" robotSource: Miso RoboticsBased in Japan, Fanuc (OTCMKTS:FANUY) may be traded over the counter. However, don’t let that fool you as it’s one of the biggest names among stocks to buy for a robotic future. First, the company commands a market capitalization of 4.24 trillion yen (about the equivalent of $31.3 billion using the at-time-of-writing exchange rate).Second, carries significant relevance for anyone interested in robots as an investment vehicle. Per its website, Fanuc is the world’s leading supplier of automation for manufacturing including robotics, CNCs [computerized numerical controls] and motion control.Fundamentally, Fanuc deserves consideration as one of the robotics stocks to buy because of the implications regarding the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Per Precedence Research, industrial IoT reached a market size of $326.1 billion last year. However, by 2030, experts project that the segment could command a valuation of $1.74 trillion.Enticingly, not too many folks in the market believe in Fanuc. Shares slipped nearly 28% since the start of the year. However, this dynamic might spell opportunity for the contrarian.Knightscope (KSCP)A Knightscope robot with a Samsung logo patrols the Samsung corporate campus.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comWhile the riskiest name on this list for stocks to buy in anticipation of robots taking over society, Knightscope (NASDAQ:KSCP) actually lives up to this billing quite literally. Billed as a security camera and robotics firm, Knightscope specializes in the manufacturing and deployment of autonomous data robots. This security force monitors people in malls, parking lots, neighborhoods and other public areas.To understand Knightscope’s wider implications, think about film franchises like Robocop. Aside from the gratuitous depictions of wanton violence, that’s pretty much what Knightscope robots do: use self-driving technology to monitor public places, reporting security concerns to law enforcement officers if necessary.While I don’t want to dive into the granularity, it’s safe to say that socially, America stands on delicate ground. By utilizing robots as the first point of contact regarding security protocols, Knightscope can help mitigate social tensions.Though incredibly intriguing, the problem is that KSCP is also incredibly risky. Since the start of the year, shares plunged 72%. Therefore, you must think carefully before pulling the trigger.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

We designed this program to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longer-term financial objectives. Under the Trifecta Program, we are targeting Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of at least $100, Adjusted EPS of at least $10, and ROIC of 13% or higher by the end of 2025.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within Item 2 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 for a discussion of items adjusted to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (""Adjusted EPS"") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within Item 2 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, and within Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of items adjusted to arrive at Adjusted Net Income (Loss).Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that represents operating income (loss) including income (loss) from equity investments and income taxes but excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. Refer to Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 for a discussion of items adjusted to arrive at Adjusted Operating Income (Loss). We use this non-GAAP measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).Available Passenger Cruise Days (""APCD"") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis.Invested Capital represents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus Total shareholders' equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).Return on Invested Capital (""ROIC"") represents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. ROIC is also used as a key metric in our long-term incentive compensation program for our executive officers.1 iCON Infrastructure Partners VI (""iCON VI"") comprises two parallel limited partnerships, iCON Infrastructure Partners VI, L.P. and iCON Infrastructure Partners VI-B, L.P. iCON Infrastructure Management VI Limited, the managing general partner of each of iCON Infrastructure Partners VI, L.P. and iCON Infrastructure Partners VI-B, L.P., is licensed by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. iCON Infrastructure LLP (""iCON""), the investment advisor to the managing general partner, is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1213007/RCG_Logo.jpg SOURCE Royal Caribbean Group]"

Both contracts were still trading near one-year lows, having logged steep declines in recent sessions on fears of a potential recession in 2023.But a pledge from the U.S. government that it will begin refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) from February also served as a buy signal for markets. The Biden administration said on Friday that it will initially buy 3 million barrels of oil, while also engaging in fixed-price purchases of crude.The U.S. government drew heavily from the SPR in a bid to cap rising fuel prices this year, bringing it to its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The Biden administration had also signaled that it would begin replenishing the reserve when crude prices were trading at lower levels.An earthquake in West Texas, the country’s biggest oil producing region, also ramped up fears of tightening U.S. crude supply, which benefited prices. Forecasts for a colder-than-expected winter also indicate that crude prices could be supported by more demand for heating oil in the near-term.Story continuesStill, crude prices were trading nearly flat for the year, as markets feared that rising interest rates and high inflation will result in a potential recession in 2023. A slew of hawkish signals from major central banks rattled crude markets last week, with the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank signaling that interest rates will keep rising for the near-term.Weak economic data from China also showed that the country has a long road to recovery, which could indicate a staggered recovery in demand.Related ArticlesOil rises on Chinese demand hopes, U.S. SPR replenishmentGold prices muted, copper rises on China reopening hopesEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

If you want to read about some more cheapest stocks with the biggest upside, go directly to 5 Cheapest Stocks With Biggest Upside.According to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in late October 2022, the real gross domestic product (GDP) in the US increased at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in real GDP reflected increases in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, which were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and private inventory investment. The stock market has been witnessing high volumes as the latest numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate that the US economy grew an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2022, better than the initial estimate of 2.6%, and beating forecasts of 2.7%. The performance reflects the upward revisions to consumer and business spending and net trade. The biggest positive contribution came from net trade, as imports sank more while exports rose more. The nonresidential investment jumped at a faster 5.1% which is better than the expected 3.7%. Considering the expenditure side, personal consumption expenditures account for 68% of total GDP, out of which purchases of goods constitute 23% and services 45%. Moreover, private investment accounts for 16% of GDP and government consumption and investment for 18%. The figures paint a warmer picture for the US economy considering the slowdown witnessed in the first two quarters of the year, boosting stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX). As far as the global economy is concerned, it is still adjusting to the pandemic shock and the subsequent policy response. In 2023, the US economy will continue to face a rather different set of risks, according to a recent Bloomberg report which shows that a recession is effectively certain in the next 12 months. Likewise, analysis published by Financial Times shows that economists are thinking about a recession likely to happen in the US, with the probability of such a recession being more than 60%.  Story continuesMoreover, tightening financial conditions, persistent inflation and expectations of a hawkish Federal Reserve are raising the risk of a contraction as well. These uncertainties are fanning the flames of inflation and nudging the Fed toward an even more aggressive policy path. However, there is hope that the cyclical sector of the US market still contains plausible soft-landing potential, a combination of an outcome where job openings are falling while the unemployment rate remains low. As the stock market recovers from a dismal 2022 and prepares for an uncertain 2023, investors eager for an entry point into the stock world should consider investing in some cheap stocks that have explosive growth potential. These options can provide investors with some balanced risk/reward profiles in a market where investments in value stocks are soaring and putting money into prominent growth stocks carries much higher levels of risk. Some of these options are discussed below. Investing in the US market is also advisable since it is the largest and the most accessible market in the world.  No other market is as liquid as the US stock market. The number of listed companies in the US far outnumber those in other parts of the world. The NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange also represent one of the single biggest concentrations of money in global history. This means that they have a large market capitalization and high transaction volumes, boosting chances of solid returns.Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies that have upcoming growth catalysts and were priced under $50 per share, as of December 18, were selected for the list.

93,9de79b85-b6bb-3e25-a1a7-ee84cd324d72,NVDA,2022-12-19,Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent 5.5% drop adds to one-year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-dramatic-actions-110016719.html,1671447616,STORY,['NVDA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 5.5% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 40% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell NVIDIA, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NVIDIA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 5.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can see that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$17b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

The Walt Disney Company, which released the film, earlier said it expected China sales to fall between $50 million and $100 million.Globally, the film opened with $134 million from U.S. and Canadian cinemas, and $301 million globally (including sales in China). Avatar: The Way of Water’s North American haul came in slightly below Disney’s expectations of $135 million to $150 million, and below analyst predictions of $175 million, according to CNBC.Still, the combined total of $435 million is enough to give Avatar: The Way of Water the second-biggest global opening weekend of the year, behind fellow Disney film Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, which earned a total of $450 million in its opening weekend.The Avatar sequel needs to rake in a huge box office haul to recoup its development costs, with a reported production cost of $350 million—a figure that does not include the money spent on marketing. James Cameron, the film’s director, himself suggested that Avatar: The Way of Water would need to be “the third or fourth highest-grossing film in history” to break even.The science fiction film is the first Western blockbuster to be released in China since August’s Minions: The Rise of Gru. Beijing has blocked the release of other films from Disney, including recent Marvel movies like Dr. Strange and Spider-Man: No Way Home (which holds the record of biggest global opening weekend during the pandemic).Analysts said that a China release was necessary for the film to hit its target. “If Avatar: The Way of Water had not gotten a release in China, that would really not be a good thing for the movie,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, previously told Fortune.Story continuesThe Walt Disney Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.China's COVID surgeChina is grappling with a surge in cases as the country pivots away from its COVID-zero policy. Beijing had used lockdowns and mass testing to suppress COVID outbreaks, but economic damage and growing public dissatisfaction encouraged Beijing to ease several regulations earlier this month.Beijing announced earlier this month that it would roll back several of its pandemic control measures, including limiting lockdowns to individual floors and apartment buildings, removing testing requirements for public venues and travel, and allowing mild and asymptomatic COVID cases to recover at home rather than in centralized isolation camps.Yet health officials warn that China could see several waves of COVID as the country lifts more containment measures. A surge could drag down the economy as people stay home because they’ve either fallen ill or are worried about catching COVID. China’s business confidence is now at its lowest point since January 2013, according to a survey from World Economics.Official Chinese data suggests that COVID cases are falling from their peak earlier this month, but observers note the official count could be less reliable after Beijing repealed many of the country’s testing requirements and stopped including asymptomatic cases in its data. Chinese shoppers are flocking to drugstores to buy cold and flu medication, and funeral homes in Beijing are reporting an increase in deaths from COVID-positive individuals.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

The film has little major competition until February.""The Way of Water"" is ""built for the long haul, as are almost all James Cameron films,"" said Jeff Bock, senior media analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. Audiences ""may not show up the opening weekend, but they will show up eventually.""Studios split ticket sales with theaters, and Cameron has said ""The Way of Water"" will need to make $2 billion just to break even. Disney has not disclosed the budget and marketing costs.The movie was released 13 years after the first installment wowed audiences with pioneering 3D technology. The original ""Avatar"" remains the all-time box office champion with $2.9 billion in global ticket sales.The first ""Avatar"" and Cameron's ""Titanic"", which also dominated at the box office the year it was released, played in theaters for weeks longer than most movies.Story continuesTony Chambers, head of theatrical distribution at Disney, said he expected ""The Way of Water"" to bring in strong sales over the holiday period and said its performance should be judged after the New Year.""We know it's resonating,"" he said, noting positive reactions from ticket buyers and film critics. ""We are in very good shape.""The sequel was delayed multiple times as Cameron and co-writers crafted a story to be told over four additional movies. A third ""Avatar"" installment and part of a fourth already have been filmed.In ""The Way of Water,"" actors Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana return as Jake Sully and Neytiri 10 years later, now parents of five children. Their peaceful life is interrupted when the Sky People, the Na'vi name for humans, return to go after Jake.Film critics praised the visual spectacle of ""The Way of Water,"" and 94% of ticket buyers provided a positive rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on F5 is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$418m ÷ (US$5.3b - US$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, F5 has an ROCE of 12%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.7% generated by the Communications industry. See our latest analysis for F5 roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for F5 compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering F5 here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For F5 Tell Us?In terms of F5's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 37%, but since then they've fallen to 12%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.In Conclusion...In summary, F5 is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 8.9% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing F5 that you might find interesting.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Consumers can expect that number to rise even more in the New Year, according to analysts.""You're going to continue to see some more pricing in 2023,"" Peter Saleh, BTIG managing director and restaurant analyst, told Yahoo Finance, as fast food giants ""try and offset some of these inflationary pressures, which for the most part right now really haven't really eased yet.""Per the November Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI), the cost to dine out is still up 8.5% compared to last year, up 0.5% month-over-month. Saleh noted ""what they took did not fully offset the mid to mid-teens commodity inflation... They're not back to kind of even on that front.""Morningstar Analyst Sean Dunlop is on the same page. ""We'll particularly see that [higher prices] in the first half of the year, because a lot of operators are still looking at their own basket of costs increasing in the high single digits or sometimes low double digits.""The consumer isn't expected to pushback in 2023 though. Katie Thomas, lead at Kearney Consumer Institute, is ""bullish"" on the consumer.""We're not seeing consumers pushing back too much quite yet...they're still sort of absorbing it in the reality of the day to day, and especially even post pandemic, they still want to get out and eat out,"" she said.""Once we're through the holidays into 2023, that could start to happen ... but we're still pretty bullish on the consumer right now ... They're, they are just absorbing these price increases,"" Thomas said.Story continuesThere is an upside for the fast food giants though.

Top trends to keep an eye on in the New Year include ongoing price action, investment in digital, restaurant design, and tipping, experts told Yahoo Finance.'More pricing in 2023'In 2022, menu prices increased by 12.9%, per new data from Pricelisto.com. Consumers can expect that number to rise even more in the New Year, according to analysts.""You're going to continue to see some more pricing in 2023,"" Peter Saleh, BTIG managing director and restaurant analyst, told Yahoo Finance, as fast food giants ""try and offset some of these inflationary pressures, which for the most part right now really haven't really eased yet.""Per the November Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI), the cost to dine out is still up 8.5% compared to last year, up 0.5% month-over-month. Saleh noted ""what they took did not fully offset the mid to mid-teens commodity inflation... They're not back to kind of even on that front.""Morningstar Analyst Sean Dunlop is on the same page. ""We'll particularly see that [higher prices] in the first half of the year, because a lot of operators are still looking at their own basket of costs increasing in the high single digits or sometimes low double digits.""The consumer isn't expected to pushback in 2023 though. Katie Thomas, lead at Kearney Consumer Institute, is ""bullish"" on the consumer.""We're not seeing consumers pushing back too much quite yet...they're still sort of absorbing it in the reality of the day to day, and especially even post pandemic, they still want to get out and eat out,"" she said.""Once we're through the holidays into 2023, that could start to happen ... but we're still pretty bullish on the consumer right now ... They're, they are just absorbing these price increases,"" Thomas said.Story continuesThere is an upside for the fast food giants though. Saleh said, ""A lot of the restaurants will have to continue to take some incremental pricing on, because the margins have just really come down substantially across the space.""Digital is 'the wave of the future'Camille Angenor, 17, a senior at Muhlenberg High School, places her order on a kiosk inside the newly renovated McDonald's along 5th Street Highway in Reading on Jan. 7, 2019.

At Chipotle, more than one-third, 37.2%, of total food and beverage revenue, which was $2.2 billion, were digital.Restaurant Brands International's digital sales grew 26% year-over-year, to $3.4 billion, representing a third of total sales. Following the quarterly report, the company, which owns Popeyes, Burger King, Tim Hortons and Firehouse Subs, named Patrick Doyle as Executive Chairman. Dolye is best down for driving digital growth as the former CEO of Domino's Pizza from 2010 to 2018. Earlier this year, Burger King announced a $400 million plan to bring it into the future, including advertising and digital investments.Don't expect any slowdown soon either, Saleh told Yahoo Finance. There will not be ""pullback and spending on trying to drive digital,"" he said.""I think this is the wave of the future, almost every company out there is trying to drive more digital mix ...

Like the Oracle of Omaha, we give Occidental Petroleum a high rating for terrific value, dependable dividends and powerful energy production.Occidental Petroleum has a dual mandate. Helping achieve a “net-zero future” is part of Occidental’s credo, but so is providing “reliable energy now.” Why is energy needed now, though?It’s because the U.S. and other free nations are seeking independence from not-always-friendly petroleum-producing countries. Occidental Petroleum has everything that a Buffett-style investor could ask for, and is also a problem-solver as America works toward energy self-sufficiency.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$62.45What’s Great About OXY Stock?If you’re like Buffett, you’re constantly on the lookout for a great value. OXY stock fits that description perfectly, as Occidental Petroleum’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is quite reasonable at just 5.29x.Occidental Petroleum’s shareholders have enjoyed good returns in 2022 despite the broad market’s downturn. At the same time, it’s not too late to take a position as the shares aren’t overbought by any reasonable valuation measure. Plus, long-term investors can collect dividend distributions. Occidental pays a forward annual dividend yield of 0.81%.Now, we’re starting to see why OXY stock would be a Buffett pick. Now, if you’re wondering whether those dividend payments are safe, consider this. Occidental Petroleum generated a whopping $2.5 billion of net income during this year’s third quarter.In other words, Occidental has vast income streams coming in and should have no problem maintaining its dividend payouts.An Energy Crisis Could Favor OXY StockIs there a looming energy crisis? Faisal Humayun is bracing for the possibility of a petroleum supply shortfall, and he identified OXY stock as a prime pick. Nobody’s hoping that an energy crisis will occur, but Humayun is 100% right to consider Occidental Petroleum shares as an ideal investment amid geopolitical tensions and conflict.Story continuesIf any American oil producer can be counted on to step up to the plate, it’s Occidental Petroleum. During 2022’s third quarter, the company produced 1.18 million of barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed). This result “exceeded the midpoint of guidance by 25 Mboed,” Occidental pointed out.This is a timely result as OPEC+ isn’t as cooperative as America and other nations would like them to be. OPEC+ includes the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and also includes Russia. In October, OPEC+ agreed to reduce its petroleum output by 2 million barrels per day.That production cut is supposed to last until the end of 2023. In early December, OPEC+ reaffirmed its commitment to that production reduction. Therefore, a global energy crisis is a distinct possibility in the coming months and years. Clearly, America’s energy security is a priority now and Occidental Petroleum’s high-volume domestic production is well-timed.What You Can Do NowNow, we’ve figured out what Buffett probably sees in Occidental Petroleum. There’s a great value proposition plus reliable dividend distributions. However, there’s more to the story here.At stake is America’s energy security and independence. Domestic drillers must step up and produce oil now, even if they’re committed to a net-zero future, and that’s exactly what Occidental Petroleum is doing. So, feel free to be like Buffett and invest in a great value, and in U.S. energy independence, with OXY stock.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in OXY.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Coca-Cola has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola peKeen to find out how analysts think Coca-Cola's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Coca-Cola's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Coca-Cola's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 12% gain to the company's bottom line. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 26% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 7.5% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.3% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.In light of this, it's curious that Coca-Cola's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.What We Can Learn From Coca-Cola's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesOur examination of Coca-Cola's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Having said that, be aware  Coca-Cola is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

With the Federal Reserve committed to attacking escalating prices, hydrocarbons (and other commodities) may face pricing pressure. As well, the Fed’s rate hikes could spark a recession.On the other hand, discounted oil stocks may represent a viable opportunity because the sector may rise again. Sadly, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will likely continue. And that means Russian hydrocarbons effectively remain shelved for perhaps years to come. Also, normalization trends bode cynically well for energy providers. With 90% of companies likely to recall their workers, commuting volume may rise.While many if not most hydrocarbon players shot up into overvalued territory, a few names remain undervalued. Below are the discounted oil stocks to pick up on recession jitters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVLOValero Energy$117.82MTDRMatador Resources$56.08EPSNEpsilon Energy$6.62PNRGPrimeEnergy Resources$82.50PARXFParex Resources$13.35IMOImperial Oil$47.19WDSWoodside EnergyValero Energy (VLO)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comListed in the Fortune 500, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) represents an international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels, other petrochemical products and power. At the moment, Valero commands a market capitalization of $46.5 billion. On a year-to-date basis, VLO gained over 56%, which might not sound like a great discount on paper.However, circumstances have been slow in the second half of 2022. For instance, in the trailing half-year period, shares dipped nearly 10%. And in the trailing month, VLO stares at a loss of almost 12%. Likely, much of this volatility centers on how the Fed will navigate its monetary policy. Though a hawkish strategy will raise borrowing costs, VLO may still benefit if full normalization in the workforce materializes.Story continuesBetter yet, the market prices VLO at only 5.14-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 8.3 times. Also, Valero’s price-to-sales ratio sits at 0.28 times, favorably lower than 82% of the competition. Thus, it’s one of the discounted oil stocks to pick up.Matador Resources (MTDR)rising oil prices concept. oil next to green up arrowSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, Matador Resources (NYSE:MTDR) is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the U.S. Per its website, it focuses on oil and natural gas shale and other unconventional mechanisms. Currently, Matador commands a market cap of $6.84 billion.Since the start of the year, MTDR gained 48.5% of equity value. Again, it doesn’t immediately sound like Matador ranks among discounted oil stocks. However, as stated above, circumstances shifted dramatically in the second half of 2022. In the trailing half-year period, MTDR slipped almost 6%. Further, in the past month, Matador absorbed a market loss of over 16%.On the fundamental level, the market prices MTDR at 5.9-times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 8.3 times. Further, the company’s price-to-operating-cash-flow ratio is 3.68 times, favorably below 61.5% of the competition.Epsilon Energy (EPSN)oil pumps and oil barrels with world map and financial chart graphsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, Epsilon Energy (NASDAQ:EPSN) is an on-shore focused independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, gathering and production of oil and gas reserves. Per its website, Epsilon’s areas of operation are the Marcellus basin in northeast Pennsylvania and the Anadarko basin in Oklahoma. Presently, the company commands a market cap of just under $153 million.In terms of discounted oil stocks to buy, EPSN is a bit friendlier for those who dislike buying into strength. Still, with a 17% YTD performance, it doesn’t exactly appear a contrarian play. However, shares have been choppy in recent trades. For example, in the trailing month, EPSN slipped nearly 9%. And its trailing five-day performance only lifted shares by a little over half-a-percent.However, the value proposition as one of the cheapened oil stocks comes into clearer view in the financials. Per Gurufocus.com, Wall Street prices EPSN at 4.7-times trailing earnings. This ranks favorably below 71.5% of the competition.PrimeEnergy Resources (PNRG)Big industrial oil tanks in a refinery base.

Specifically, the company operates approximately 710 active wells and owns non-operating and royalty interests in over 822 additional wells. At time of writing, PrimeEnergy carries a market cap of almost $158 million.As with the other oil stocks on this list, PNRG enjoyed a solid performance this year, gaining roughly 17%. While that might not appeal to those seeking a strict discount in the charts, consider that in the trailing half-year period, PNRG slipped nearly 9%. Still, it’s fair to point out that shares are gaining momentum recently. In the trailing month, PrimeEnergy popped up over 2.5%.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, PNRG rates as a modestly undervalued investment. Against traditional indicators, the market prices shares at just under 5-times trailing earnings. This ranks favorably below almost 69% of the competition.Parex Resources (PARXF)Oil barrel and spilled oil in form of United States isolated on white; oil stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in Calgary, Alberta, Parex Resources (OTCMKTS:PARXF) bills itself as a sustainable oil and gas producer, responsibly developing the resources needed to fuel social and economic development. Per its website, the Canadian hydrocarbon specialist is now the largest independent exploration and production company in Colombia. Presently, the company features a market cap of 2 billion CAD (roughly equivalent to $1.47 billion).One aspect about Parex that might appeal to speculative contrarian investors is its market performance. Since the beginning of this year, PARXF gave up almost 21% of equity value. Further, in the trailing half-year period, shares dropped nearly 34%. Near term, shares still find themselves in the red, with a 7.6% loss in the trailing month.Intriguingly, though, this dynamic makes Parex one of the most undervalued oil stocks to buy. The market prices PARXF at 3.5-times trailing earnings. Also, it prices shares at only 3.9-times forward earnings. Both stats rate well below their respective sector median values.Imperial Oil (IMO)Source: ShutterstockAlso headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Imperial Oil (NYSEAMERICAN:IMO) represents Canada’s second-biggest integrated oil firm. Per its public profile, Imperial Oil is a significant producer of crude oil, diluted bitumen and natural gas. Currently, Imperial Oil commands a market cap of $30.7 billion.As with most of the oil stocks on this list, IMO performed very well this year. Since the January opener, shares gained almost 35% of market value. While this won’t appeal to all contrarian traders, a discount materialized in the charts recently. In the trailing month, shares dropped 13%. As well, in the past five sessions, IMO slipped 5%.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculation, IMO rates as modestly undervalued. Against traditional metrics, the market prices shares at 0.8-times sales. However, the sector median value is 1.06 times, translating to Imperial Oil ranking favorably below 60.5% of the competition.Woodside Energy (WDS)oil stocks: stacks of oil barrelsSource: ShutterstockBased in Perth, Western Australia, Woodside Energy (NYSE:WDS) is an Australian petroleum exploration and production company. Per its public profile, Woodside is the operator of oil and gas production in Australia and also Australia’s largest independent dedicated oil and gas company. At the moment, the company carries a market cap of 67.7 billion AUD (approximately $46.4 billion).One of the top-performing oil stocks, since the start of the year, WDS gained a whopping 52%. Again, it doesn’t sound like much of a discount at face value. However, the second half of this year presented far different circumstances. In the trailing six months, WDS gained only about 9%. Also, in the trailing one-month period, it slipped nearly 7%.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculation for FMV, WDS is a significantly undervalued investment. Against traditional valuation metrics, it’s somewhat middling. However, investors should also note its strong profitability. For instance, Woodside’s net margin stands at 31.7%, beating out 82.5% of the competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 111% in five years. Unfortunately, though, the stock has dropped 6.6% over a week. But note that the broader market is down 2.2% since last week, and this may have impacted Automatic Data Processing's share price.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Automatic Data Processing achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Automatic Data Processing has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Automatic Data Processing will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Automatic Data Processing, it has a TSR of 134% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Automatic Data Processing has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 9.8% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 19% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Automatic Data Processing better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Automatic Data Processing .If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

124,7c2aae37-81ae-3219-a140-3e8f55c38421,PG,2022-12-19,Subdued Growth No Barrier To The Procter & Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/subdued-growth-no-barrier-procter-130050997.html,1671454850,STORY,['PG'],"[The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 25x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Procter &amp; Gamble could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble peKeen to find out how analysts think Procter &amp; Gamble's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Procter &amp; Gamble's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 5.3%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 275% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 4.4% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.2% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it concerning that Procter &amp; Gamble is trading at a P/E higher than the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Our examination of Procter &amp; Gamble's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Having said that, be aware  Procter &amp; Gamble is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Procter &amp; Gamble. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Over three-quarters (82%) of respondents say they will cut back on holiday gifts, travel expenses or take on credit card debt this holiday season because of financial concerns, with two-thirds doing so because of health care or related out-of-pocket costs.(PRNewsfoto/Aflac)""The study paints a picture of the sacrifice many households are making this holiday season, because it's difficult to pay for necessities and health care costs,"" said Diana Steinhoff, senior vice president, Aflac Benefits Solutions. ""The holiday-focused data brings awareness to how financial stress can affect the physical and mental health of Americans during what should be the most wonderful time of the year.""Stretching a buck is harder this yearAccording to the survey, almost half (44%) of American workers do not believe that their income has kept up with increases in everyday expenses, a sentiment most common among those earning less than $50,000 per year. More than two-thirds (70%) of respondents said they feel that they spent more money in 2022 on necessities than in 2021, including living expenses, mortgage/rent, out-of-pocket health care costs, health care premiums and transportation.With so many Americans struggling to pay the bills, many said they'll rein in holiday spending. A full 64% said they'll cut back on holiday costs in at least one category, including hosting parties (35%), attending parties (33%), presents (33%), sending cards (26%) and work holiday events (23%).Many don't recharge throughout the year, contributing to holiday stress Even though many Americans want quality time with loved ones this season, nearly 2 in 3 (70%) admitted they'll do at least some work during the holiday season. Checking work email, completing work assignments and taking on additional gig or contract work were most likely to overshadow quality time this season.Story continuesAlmost two-thirds (64%) agreed that, even when they are sick, they ""power through"" rather than take a sick day. This is true regardless of working arrangement (66% on-site employees; 59% remote employees; 61% hybrid employees), which means that on-site employees may be inadvertently putting their colleagues at risk by coming into work sick.More employees indicated they took less time off this year overall (31%) than those who said they took more time off (26%). And parents are far more likely than non-parents to have said they took more time off this year (35% parents, 21% non-parents). Among those taking more time off this year, doctor appointments/wellness visits are the main reason (34%), along with mental health days (32%) and planned vacation days (32%).""It's more important than ever to be smart about taking care of our physical and mental health,"" explained Steinhoff. ""Health concerns and costs compound when we don't take care of ourselves, and that is why Aflac is enhancing products to include mental health coverage and incentives for making wellness visits a priority.""Americans need more than a mental health day this holiday seasonAccording to the study, more than half (55%) of all employees admitted they feel more anxious during the holiday season, and over 2 in 5 (43%) said they feel more depressed during the holidays. Anxiety is particularly high among Gen Z, and women are disproportionately impacted compared to men. The survey uncovered a variety of coping strategies that employers can use to help offer time and resources to address the holiday blues.Time and allowances for exercise, yoga and self-care: Half (51%) of American workers use regular exercise to protect their mental health and well-being during the holidays.Holiday health hazard awareness: Almost half (46%) of American workers have suffered an injury from a holiday-related accident or mishap. Most common is slipping and falling on ice (25%), but over 1 in 10 have also hurt themselves tripping over new toys in the household (17%) or lifting heavy gifts (14%). These physical ailments can add to the holiday stress, making it important to take precautions against holiday hazards and seek medical care when necessary.Mental health and substance abuse resources: Over a third (37%) admitted that they turn to alcohol or other intoxicants to get through the holiday season, and slightly more turn to retail therapy (42%). But 36% turn to counseling to protect themselves over the holiday season.To see additional survey findings and learn more about the financial effects of health care issues — and how Aflac can help with the expenses health insurance doesn't cover — visit Aflac.com/healthcareissues.MethodologyThe 2022 Aflac Holiday Health Issues Survey is an online survey among a nationally representative sample of 1,000 salaried, hourly and self-employed workers across the U.S., which was fielded between Oct. 24 and Oct. 27, 2022, by Kantar Profiles on behalf of Aflac. Learn more about the survey findings at Aflac.com/healthcareissues.ABOUT AFLAC INCORPORATED Aflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) is a Fortune 500 company helping provide protection to more than 50 million people through its subsidiaries in Japan and the U.S., paying cash fast when policyholders get sick or injured.

True, 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, making it appear a common commodity. However, only half a percent of the Earth’s water is drinkable.Just that stat alone provides an immediate sharpening of the concept surrounding the hottest water stocks to own. Further, as the world’s population continues to increase, a mathematical conundrum materializes. For decades now, geopolitical experts warned that the wars of tomorrow could be fought over water, not oil.For this discussion, I don’t want to get too macabre. However, it’s important to lay out the facts and not take this resource – or its management – for granted. With that in mind, below are the hottest water stocks to own for 2023 and beyond.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWTRGEssential Utilities$47.63AWKAmerican Water Works$156.19YORWYork Water$45.06XYLXylem$109.99CWCOConsolidated Water$15.04VEOEYVeolia Environment$25.95SMRNuScale Power$10.36Essential Utilities (WTRG)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comAn American utility firm, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) has stakes in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. Per its public profile, Essential Utilities provides drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. Currently, the company commands a market capitalization of $12.7 billion. On a year-to-date basis, WTRG dipped more than 8%. However, in the trailing month, shares gained 3%.Last month, the company beat top-and-bottom line estimates for earnings and revenue. Essential delivered earnings per share of 26 cents, beating the consensus target of 23 cents. Further, it posted operating revenue of $435 million, easily exceeding analysts’ view of $376 million.Story continuesTo be fair, the financials present somewhat of a mixed narrative. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, WTRG rates as a modestly undervalued investment. However, the company’s balance sheet could use some work, particularly with a lowly Altman Z-Score that suggests higher-than-normal risk of bankruptcy. Still, with strong revenue growth and profit margins, Essential owns the goods to succeed. Therefore, it ranks among the hottest water stocks to own.American Water Works (AWK)A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comAnother public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) through its subsidiaries provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company offers water and wastewater services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states serving a population of approximately 14 million through 3.4 million customer connections. Since the start of the year, AWK gave up 14% of equity value. However, in the trailing month, shares gained over 8%.As with Essential Utilities above, American Water could use some work in the balance sheet. Again, the Altman Z-Score is a bit distracting at 1.32, reflecting higher-than-normal bankruptcy risk. As well, it features a poor cash-to-debt ratio of only 0.01 times. Still, AWK attracts positive attention overall. Per TipRanks, the company features a moderate buy consensus view.In addition, American Water has a three-year book growth rate of 7.4%, beating out over 67% of the competition. As well, its return on equity pings at 17.8%, reflecting superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits. Thus, it’s well worth consideration among the hottest water stocks to own.York Water (YORW)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comAn investor-owned, public utility company operating in Pennsylvania, York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) features a very rich history. Founded in 1816 by a group of local business men concerned about fire protection, York is the oldest company of its kind in this country. As well, it has the longest record of consecutive dividends since 1816.Just for context, James Monroe was elected as POTUS in 1816. And while contemporary politics loves to mention the Founding Fathers, Monroe actually was one. Unfortunately for YORW stakeholders, heritage alone couldn’t save the underlying company from market volatility. Since the January opener, YORW dipped almost 7%. However, shares have enjoyed near-term momentum. In the trailing month, they gained 4.5%, possibly reflecting the early innings of a recovery.Depending on the metrics you use, YORW runs between fairly valued to significantly overvalued. However, under these circumstances, people may continue to pay a premium for stability. Also, keep in mind that York is a decent-quality business, featuring a ROE of nearly 11%. Thus, it’s a solid idea for the hottest water stocks to own.Xylem (XYL)a picture of waterSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered Rye Brook, New York, Xylem (NYSE:XYL) is a large American water technology provider, in public utility, residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial settings. Per its corporate profile, the company does business in more than 150 countries. Its products and services are focused in two areas: water infrastructure and applied water.Since the start of the year, XYL comes in around 2% below parity. That’s a decent performance considering that during the same period, the benchmark equities index is down nearly 17%. However, shares really came alive during the back half of 2022. Specifically, in the trailing six months, XYL gained a whopping 50%.To be fair, such a performance came at a cost. According to Gurufocus.com – against both its proprietary FMV calculations and traditional metrics – XYL rates as overvalued. On the plus side, Xylem’s Altman Z-Score hits 3.94, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Also, Xylem is another decent quality enterprise with an ROE of 10%, making it one of the hottest water stocks.Consolidated Water (CWCO)Source: ShutterstockBased in the Cayman Islands, Consolidated Water (NASDAQ:CWCO) is an international water solutions company, supplying potable water, treating water for reuse, and manufacturing and providing water-related products and services. Its customer base covers the Bahamas, the U.S., the British Virgin Islands along with its home market.If you’ve ever doubted the pertinence of the hottest water stocks to own for the future, just look at CWCO. Since the January opener, shares exploded higher to the tune of 45%. Better yet, the back half performance is similarly robust, with CWCO gaining nearly 21% in the trailing six months.If anything, the one analyst that covers Consolidated Water likes it too, pegging it as a moderate buy. As well, the price target is $20, reflecting a respectable double-digit gain from the time-of-writing price of $15.58.Per Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculation, CWCO is fairly valued. Investors should check out its balance sheet, particularly its robust cash balance. If you want a long-term idea, CWCO rates as one of the hottest water stocks to own.Veolia Environment (VEOEY)Source: ShutterstockMoving into the more speculative realm of the hottest water stocks to own, Veolia Environment (OTCMKTS:VEOEY) may intrigue market gamblers. A French transnational firm, Veolia features activities in three main service and utility areas traditionally managed by public authorities: water management, waste management and energy services.In particular, Veolia may represent a compelling idea because of its expertise in desalination. Per its website, desalination allows converting seawater into a life sustaining and usable resource. As one of the holy grails at the intersection of science and economics, desalination works. However, getting the process to financially make sense represents another matter altogether.Currently, VEOEY shareholders stare at a loss of over 27% in the charts. However, in the trailing month, the stock rebounded, gaining more than 5%.Against forward earnings, VEOEY rates as a fairly valued investment. Performance metrics in the balance sheet and income statement run somewhere in the middle of the road: not great, not terrible. Nevertheless, if you like high-risk wagers, Veolia could be one of the hottest water stocks to own.NuScale Power (SMR)Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comTo be completely upfront with you, NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) is not a direct play among the hottest water stocks. Rather, the company plies its trade in the nuclear power industry. However, NuScale does things differently, specializing in small modular reactors. As the name suggests, SMRs occupy a smaller physical footprint and integrates the latest safety protocols. Therefore, these facilities can integrate in areas previously inaccessible for traditional nuclear powerplants.What does this have to do with the world’s most precious resource? The combination of NuScale’s SMR technology and available desalination platforms can make the process of converting ocean water into potable water an economically viable enterprise. Per NuScale’s website, a single SMR coupled to a desalination plant can produce 77 million gallons of clean water.To be fair, investors interested in SMR stock should realize that the underlying company presents risks. However, if you’re comfortable with market wagers, NuScale is easily one of the hottest water stocks to own.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

131,efd5abfc-6c8d-3c66-acd5-fd94a6d800a8,PEP,2022-12-19,The 7 Hottest Food Stocks to Own for 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-hottest-food-stocks-own-180702361.html,1671127622,STORY,"['BRBR', 'MKC-V', 'PEP', 'HRL', 'COST', 'AVO', 'HSY']","[Food stocks have regained some favor in 2022. Over the past few years, many investors passed over the sector. After all, food tends to be a slowly growing industry that may not hold the glamor or appeal of, say, tech stocks. However, food stocks have dramatically outperformed many other sectors in 2022. That isn’t too surprising because the food and beverage sector is known for being a safe harbor during market storms. Since that’s the case, it’s a great time to look at the seven hottest food stocks.But there’s a lot more to food stocks than just their defensiveness. Many of the leading food companies have dramatically outperformed versus the S&amp;P 500 over the longer term. The combination of food makers’ recession-resistant businesses, high profit margins, and strong brands tend to lead to superior returns.HSYHershey$233PEPPepsiCo$179HRLHormel Foods$45.60MCKMcCormick$368BRBRBellring Brands$24.65AVOMission Produce$15COSTCostco$466InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHershey (HSY)The entrance to the Hershey factory in downtown Hershey, Pennsylvania. HSY stock.Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.comConfection and snack maker Hershey (NYSE:HSY) has been one of 2022’s more surprising winners. The shares have rallied 21% in 2022 and reached new all-time highs recently.The company’s success isn’t hard to explain. The American chocolate sector has limited competition, with Hershey and Mars holding most of the U.S. chocolate  market. Additionally, people have strong taste preferences when it comes to chocolate. That generally protects firms like Hershey from facing cheaper, store-brand competition. That, in turn, has allowed Hershey to hike prices quickly during the current inflationary shock, protecting the firm’s profit margins.Hershey’s best-in-class earnings results and operational momentum have allowed HSY stock to stand out even during this bear market. In addition to Hershey’s strong chocolate business, it has acquired several snack brands in recent years which give the company additional growth avenues, particularly with younger consumers.Story continuesPepsico (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comMost investors probably know Pepsico (NYSE:PEP) for its soft-drink business. However, there’s more to Pepsico than just soda. The company also owns Frito-Lay, which is one of the world’s most dominant snack businesses.The addition of chips and other savory snacks has given Pepsico a tremendous second lever for growth. There are natural synergies from owning both beverages and snacks, in terms of supply chains, marketing, and cross-promotion. More broadly, the snack business has given Pepsico a clearer long-term outlook than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), since Pepsico is less reliant on sugary-drink sales for its profits.Pepsico has shown tremendous consistency over the years. PEP stock has appreciated at an  annualized rate  of over 11% in the past three, five, and ten years, respectively. Pepsico is rarely flashy, but the company consistently generates value for its shareholders, leading to strong and steady returns by PEP stock.Hormel Foods (HRL)Grocery shelf of SPAM cans made by Hormel (HRL)Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.comHormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a Minnesota-based packaged foods company that was founded way back in 1891. The company’s fortunes were long tied to products such as Spam, its canned-meat product. Investors might think Hormel is behind the times, given its history.However, Hormel has overhauled its portfolio to prepare for future decades. The company is now a leader in all sorts of healthier and more fashionable proteins. Specifically, Hormel has invested heavily in deli meats, turkey, nuts, nut butters, guacamole, and even plant-based meat alternatives. Hormel has a protein of every type and price point to meet the tastes of the next generation of consumers.While Hormel has a forward-looking assortment of brands, it manages its business conservatively, as it tends to maintain a strong balance sheet with low amounts of debt. That has allowed Hormel to become a Dividend King. In other words,  it has raised its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years, thanks to its continuing financial strength.In 2002, HRL stock was trading for $6 a share on a split-adjusted basis. Nowadays the shares are up to over $45 each.  A strong portfolio of food brands paired with a superior management team can make a great deal of money for investors.McCormick (MKC)A steak surrounded by flame on a grill.Source: Joshua Resnick / Shutterstock.comMcCormick (NYSE:MKC) is America’s leading purveyor of spices and flavors. The company naturally has a strong business because  grocery stores don’t want to carry multiple brands of such simple spices as bottled black pepper, vanilla, and cinnamon. Throw in McCormick’s deep supply chain and its ability to obtain spices globally, and the company’s business is hard to disrupt.However, there’s more to McCormick than spices. It has become one of the hottest food stocks, in more ways than one, thanks to its various acquisitions in the hot-sauces category. McCormick has purchased Frank’s and Cholula, among other brands, in recent years.Hot sauce is one of the fastest-growing categories within packaged foods, with the global market expected to grow at an annual pace of 7.9% going forward. That’s far faster growth than that of most food products, whose sales tend to only keep pace with population growth and inflation.McCormick has done a great job positioning its portfolio to benefit from millennials’ interest in more unique cuisines and distinct flavors. And, after several years of MCK stock being relatively flat, its shares should be set for another leg higher in 2023.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comAnother way to get exposure to the food industry is through  grocery stores. And there have arguably been few hotter food stocks over the past few years than Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). Indeed, COST stock has rallied more than 150% over the past five years.The pandemic helped highlight Costco’s various strengths. The company is known for treating its employees well and providing them with wages and benefits well above those of its direct peers. That strategy proved invaluable in 2020 when it was hard to retain qualified staff. Because of its approach, Costco had a tremendous edge when it came to keeping its stores open, clean, and humming along.Costco also tends to fare well during periods of high inflation. The company’s differentiated business model, featuring membership charges and rock-bottom prices, has given consumers confidence that their dollars can stretch farther when they shop at Costco. The company’s gas stations have proven to be another big competitive edge as gas prices have soared throughout much of 2022.But COST stock is changing hands for around 34 times its forward earnings today. That’s admittedly not cheap. However, Costco’s exemplary, long-term returns and continued strong, long-term outlook into the mid-2020s make Costco a reasonable food stock even at its current, loftier valuation.Bellring Brands (BRBR)7 Food Stocks to Buy NowSource: Shutterstock.comBellring Brands (NYSE:BRBR) is another food company that makes a point of appealing to younger consumers. Primarily, Bellring operates in the protein space.The company has a three-sided approach to protein. It sells protein beverages under the Premier Protein label, it markets Dymatize, which is a line of protein powder, and Bellring also sells its high-protein PowerBar.In this way, the company can reach protein-focused consumers regardless of whether they want to buy bars, shakes, or protein powder. In recent years, we’ve seen more interest in reducing consumption of carbohydrates while prioritizing protein consumption. Add in increased focus on fitness, and Bellring should enjoy a strong growth in the coming years.Mission Produce (AVO)Source: ShutterstockRounding out the list is fresh foods leader Mission Produce (NASDAQ:AVO). The company is a dominant player in the worldwide avocado market, with operations spanning many countries. Mission is also involved in the mango business.Avocados have grown in popularity in recent years. Guacamole is a popular snack food, of course. Additionally, younger consumers have increasingly turned to avocado oil  as a healthier substitute to butter or vegetable oil.A recent report suggested that the global avocado market will grow at an annualized rate of 7% throughout the next decade.The stock completed its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020, and its shares quickly doubled, reaching a peak in the mid-$20s. Now, however, the stock has pulled back to $15, creating a more tasty entry point.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held long positions in HSY, HRL, and MKC stock.

132,21f21303-0e55-3bc1-b260-991ea1285510,PEP,2022-12-19,Our 3 Top Defensive Stock Picks for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-defensive-stock-picks-163600217.html,1671122160,STORY,"['COST', 'PEP', 'DG', 'KO']","[Defensive stocks are securities that reliably perform well in good times and bad. They tend to be the stocks of established, market-leading, blue-chip companies that pay out consistent dividends and post stable earnings regardless of the state of the economy or stock market. Their products tend to be necessary rather than discretionary in nature, and they have pricing power when needed, which means they can raise their prices without losing customers. Defensive stocks tend to fall less and rise more as markets ebb and flow. So with many economists forecasting a recession in the U.S. during 2023, defensive stocks are likely to become more important to investors’ portfolios. Here are our three top defensive stock picks for 2023.DGDollar General$250PEPPepsiCo$180COSTCostco$460Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs 2022 draws to a close, the share price of Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is up 4% on the year at $250 That might seem like a small gain, but it trounces the 19% decline posted by the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.DG, which owns a chain of retail stores, sells products for $5 or less, with many items selling for only $1. As might be expected, Dollar General’s business has picked up with inflation running at a 40-year high in the U.S. and with the prices of many consumer products increasing to unaffordable levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDollar General has performed strongly throughout 2022, announcing that its net sales rose 11% last quarter to $9.5 billion. The Tennessee-based company also continues to expand, having added 734 new retail outlets and bringing its total store count to 18,818.With many economists forecasting a recession for America in 2023, Dollar General, in light of its status as one of the top defensive stocks of 2023, is likely to continue performing well in the months ahead. Its price-earnings ratio of 23 is decent, and DG stock pays a quarterly dividend of 55 cents, which is helpful to shareholders.Story continuesPepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comSome people might put Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) on this list. But we give the nod to Coke’s archrival, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). What distinguishes PepsiCo from Coca-Cola is that New York-based Pepsi sells food products in addition to beverages. Its popular food brands, such as Quaker Oatmeal, Ruffles potato chips, and Rold Gold pretzels, help to widen the competitive moat around PepsiCo, which also sells a signature line of beverages that includes Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Consumers remain loyal to PepsiCo’s products and will continue to buy them even if we enter a recession in 2023. This gives PepsiCo strong pricing power, a characteristic that has been reflected in the performance of its stock throughout 2022.Over the past 12 months, PEP stock has gained 5% and now trades at $180 a share. Even with the gain, the stock still trades at a fair price-earnings ratio of 25. And the stock pays a strong dividend that yields 2.55%.Costco (COST)Source: ShutterstockFew companies’ customer base is as loyal as that of Costco’s (NASDAQ:COST) . Additionally, few have greater pricing power than the retail giant.In September, Costco reported that 92.6% of its customers in the U.S. and Canada had renewed their membership, agreeing to pay at least $60 a year for the privilege of shopping at the company’s retail outlets. That represented an all-time high renewal rate for the company in the U.S. and Canada.Globally, 90.4% of customers renewed their Costco memberships. That huge renewal rate is the envy of the retail sector and shows the fervent loyalty consumers have to Costco.As consumer prices remain elevated and consumers’ wallets are squeezed, it is likely that they will rely even more on Costco, which marks up its products less than the average of grocery retailers. Costco has also greatly benefited in 2022from  selling gasoline to motorists at cheaper prices than they can find at other gas stations.The sharp decline of gasoline prices this past autumn caused Costco’s third-quarter results  to come in slightly below analysts’ average estimates But don’t be fooled; Costco is built to help consumers survive an economic recession.Over the last year, COST stock has declined 17% to $460 a share, pulling its price-earnings ratio down to 35. Investors should take advantage of the decline by buying the dip.The stock pays a quarterly dividend of 90 cents a share, though the company has been known to also pay out special one-time dividends to further reward shareholders.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

You can skip our detailed analysis of factors leading to a brand becoming overrated and its consequences and head directly to 5 Most Overrated Companies and Brands Heading into 2023. Factors Leading to Brands Becoming OverratedBrand-recognition strategies can be highly effective in increasing revenue. However, a brand can become a victim of its own success due to factors that can be avoided. These include complacency, rigid bureaucratic frameworks that arise as a result of scaling and other corrosive business practices like bad customer service.However, one core factor has specifically to do with luxury goods. Luxury companies price their products on value-based pricing, which is tied around their wealthy customers’ perceived value of their products for social status. McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, stated that the luxury apparel industry is well-placed in the ongoing market downturn to outperform the rest of the clothing industry. It puts the CAGR of luxury fashion at 5-10% in the US in 2023, since its core market comprises affluent customers mostly insulated from the impact of rising interest rates and inflation. However, its Consumer Pulse survey also showed that more people from the luxury brands’ peripheral market have switched from top-tier brands to private-label products for lower prices than at any other time since the Covid pandemic began. Impact of Brand ReviewsOverrated brands do not directly suffer from declining revenue, at-least in the short to medium term. What they directly result in, is bad customer reviews. Reviews play an important role in the global economy, especially in the American economy where consumers are highly inclined to give their feedback about products they buy and use other people's feedback while making a buying decision.A Quality Logo Product survey shows 85% of people trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Bad reviews can lead to a halt in the growth of customer-base and then eventually, dwindling reputation may even lead to a decline in revenue due to customer alienation and the background inflation rate.  Story continuesAccording to data from Statista, 92% of potential customers are less likely to buy from a negatively reviewed business. The reviews for most of these overrated brands and companies can be checked out on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L), among others.Photo by Erik Mclean on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe’ve ranked brands and companies based on the review ratings from Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L), a major consumer-review platform, where consumers rate a company with stars, with 5-stars being the best and 1 star being the worst. We’ve also accounted for customer service and general sentiment around the brands in question. For major brands, we’ve also discussed consumer survey results from sources like American Affluence Research Center and also considered brands from the book Obsessive Branding Disorder, by journalist Lucas Conley.Let’s dive in. Here's the 15 most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.15. Champion, by Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI)Trustpilot Rating: 2.5 (Poor)Champion is a sportswear clothing brand owned and operated by the US apparel company Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI). Based on its Trustpilot reviews categorized as “poor”, the brand has quality control as well as customer service issues. Some other customers claimed that the products they had ordered from their store were never delivered. Champion is one of the largest brands of Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) which the latter acquired in 2016 for $90 million. 14. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Trustpilot Rating: 2.4 (Poor)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a Seattle-based multinational chain of coffee houses. The company is a household name due to its nearly 36,000 coffee houses across the globe. It’s penetrated in pop-culture as well, featuring in movies like Mean Girls. However, it has largely fallen out of favor with consumers, who claim that it is overrated. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a poor rating of 2.4 on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L) based on 1,565 reviews. Majority of reviewers complained about low maintenance, mediocre quality and unreasonable cost. Despite that, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is growing fairly well. Its YoY growth for fiscal year 2022 was 11% from the previous year.It's largely due to the fact that famous (not necessarily popular) brands often end up becoming status symbols. For instance, a University-of-Leicester study has discovered that consumption of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) food and beverages by the Chinese urban middle class is associated with status rather than quality of their products.  13. Dunkin’ DonutsTrustpilot Rating: 2.3 (Poor)Dunkin’ Donuts is an American doughnut and coffee company based in Canton, Massachusetts. It has a poor rating of 2.2 based on 181 reviews on Trustpilot Group plc (LSE:TRST.L). Dunkin’ Donuts has over 11,300 restaurants worldwide, with 8,500 in the US alone, making it a prominent brand. However, consumer reviews paint a rather negative picture, with many reviewers complaining about the quality of food, sanitation and customer service on Trustpilot. Dunkin’ Donuts has also been featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder, as an example of an overrated brand.12. GucciTrustpilot Rating: 2.1 (Poor)Gucci is a high-end fashion house headquartered in Florence, Italy. The company designs and sells products like luxury apparel, handbags and wallets, shoes, jewelry as well as watches and many other luxury items. However, 1,217 reviews on Trustpilot put Gucci’s rating at a poor 2.1, with a good majority of reviewers complaining about customer service issues, followed by product quality relative to cost.Gucci's products can be bought from their official store as well as from platforms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Target Corporation (NASDAQ:TGT), eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).11. Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO)Trustpilot Rating: 2.0 (Poor)Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is a world-famous company of women’s undergarments based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.  The company has close to 1,350 retail outlets across the world. Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is known for charging a premium on their products, owing to its luxury market. Its products’ prices rose by 83% in 2021 from  the mid-2019, according to a UBS report.Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) is another brand on the list of most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023 that has been described as overrated by Lucas Conley.10. PradaTrustpilot Rating: 1.9 (Poor)Prada, owned and operated by Prada S.p.A (PRDSY) and based in Milan, Italy, is another household name in the luxury market. It is one of the oldest fashion houses in the world, dating back to 1913. Prada designs and sells luxury clothes, handbags and footwear among other luxury items. It has a poor rating of 1.9 on Trustpilot9. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV)Trustpilot Rating: 1.9 (Poor)Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is one of the largest airlines in the United States. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is yet another company to be featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder as an overrated company. Being also the largest low cost carrier in the world, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) naturally became very prominent with customers around the world and especially in the US. However, a PR disaster from 2008 dented the company’s reputation among consumers.The airline allegedly kept flying 46 airplanes for over 60,000 flights without inspections for fuselage cracks, as reported by New York Times. This resulted in a hefty $10 million fine by the Federal Aviation Authority.It is the ninth on the list of most overrated companies and brands heading into 2023.8. SupremeTrustpilot Rating: 1.8 (Poor)Supreme is a lifestyle clothing brand based in New York City and is one of the most overrated brands heading into 2023. Based on over 400 reviews on Trustpilot, the company has a poor rating of 1.8. Most customers have complained about their lack of maintenance of their website which results in a poor shopping experience. Others have highlighted their “poor” customer service. 7. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Trustpilot Rating: 1.7 (Bad)The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is an American multinational apparel and accessories brand. It has over 2,800 stores across the world, to give you a perspective on its widespread prominence. That said, The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is also thought of as overrated. It was another brand that was featured in Obsessive Branding Disorder as an overrated company. It has a bad rating of 1.7 based on 430+ consumer reviews on Trustpilot. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has largely been criticized for its quality and cost but most importantly for its customer service and strict return-policies. 6. NIKE, Inc.
