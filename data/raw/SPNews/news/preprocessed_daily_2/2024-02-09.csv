If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the intricacies of retirement living in America’s East Coast, you may go to 5 Best East Coast Cities to Retire on a Budget of $1,200 a Month.\xa0', 'Retirement has always been a glorified period of life in the American household. It is a time when the kids have left home, work life is done and dusted, and all that’s left are long relaxing days spent at the golf course followed by evenings filled with gatherings and decadent food. In 2024, the average American retiree’s reality is very different - and not in a good way.\xa0', 'A study by\xa0The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans think they need a minimum of $1.8 million to maintain a comfortable retirement lifestyle. This is coupled with social media personalities such as Tori Dunlap and Steph and Den talking about how they’ll be retiring early with millions in the bank, far overtaking the figure quoted by this study by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) - and how other people can do so too. However, the average American household is a lifetime away from these millions.\xa0', '“Through a tax-advantaged retirement account, like a 401(k) or IRA. Open an account, put money in, and then choose your investments. It doesn’t have to be much, even $20 a month is a good start” Tori Dunlap, Founder, Her First $100K\xa0', 'While it sounds simple enough, the problem is having money to invest. The Federal Reserve Board’s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances found that about 54% of all American households were without any retirement savings, making\xa0The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) study estimate of $1.8 million figure seem rather impossible. This lack of retirement funds is due to several factors, the first among which is an organizational shift away from providing employees with defined benefit plans. USA Facts notes that in 1989 half of all working households with members in the 50 to 60 age bracket had a defined benefit plan - by 2022, only a quarter did.\xa0', ""While some companies continue to provide retirement support for their employees - such as Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE:KODK) and Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M)- in the form of defined benefit plans, the same cannot be said for all companies. Even for those employed at companies such as Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE:KODK) and Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M), the future is unstable keeping in mind America’s ever-changing economic landscape. Within the first 20 days of 2024,\xa0Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) has already announced job cuts of over 2,000, with unplanned unemployment also being a factor that deters retirement planning.\xa0"", 'Another is the newfound trend of parents financially supporting their adult children. Findings from the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel state that 55% of young adults are not financially independent from their parents. When parents are financially supporting their children well into their 30s, the former’s retirement savings take a hit - understandably so - and this leads to an unstable retirement period. So, the question then arises: how does America’s retiring class survive? Many Americans leave the States and move abroad to find affordable places to retire in the world. Others venture to find the cheapest places across America where they can retire.\xa0', 'For those who take the latter pick, moving to the American East Coast is a popular option. Rich history, stunning nature offerings, and lively culture make it an ideal retirement spot. Add its range of affordable cities, and the East Coast is one of the best places to retire on a budget in the US.\xa0', 'Not only that but there are plenty of other advantages of an East Coast retirement. The area experiences all four seasons, and offers skiing in Vermont, beaches in Miami, Disney World in Orlando, and of course, thin-crust pizza! So even if you’re living in one of the cheaper East Coast cities where a small monthly salary is considered rich, you’ll have lots near you to keep yourself entertained. After all, there’s nothing like a post-retirement trip to Disney World!\xa0', 'To know more about the best East Coast cities to retire on a budget of $1,200 a month, read below.', 'Methodology', 'To compile this list of the 15 best East Coast cities to retire on a budget of $1,200 a month, we consulted several sources including our list of 30 Cheapest Places Across America Where You Will Want to Retire, and Nasdaq, GOBankingRates, Kiplinger, Moneywise, Trulia, and RentCafe. Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, they were then further shortlisted by the cost of living index and livability scores to separate the cheaper cities from the rest - for this article, cost of living indexes were taken from Best Places and livability scores were taken from Area Vibes. Those cities with a cost of living index above 90 and a livability score of below 65 were removed from the list. A consensus approach was then used to finalize our 15 best East Coast cities to retire on a budget of $1,200 a month.\xa0', 'Once finalized, the 15 selected cities were ranked according to their cost of living with the top spot going to the city with the lowest cost of living. We also researched figures for monthly rent, taking figures from Zumper for the lowest rent tier for each city. Additionally, we also included average figures for a single person’s monthly grocery, taking quotes from the Economic Policy Institute. The resulting list is presented in descending order, ranging from the highest cost of living to the lowest cost of living.\xa0', 'It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the city you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.', ""Shares of this insurance company have returned +4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, to which Unum belongs, has lost 3.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Unum is expected to post earnings of $1.96 per share, indicating a change of +4.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $8.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.5%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Unum."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'In the case of Unum, the consensus sales estimate of $3.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.9%.

(NYSE:CF) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase CF Industries Holdings' shares before the 14th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.50 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.60 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that CF Industries Holdings has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current share price of US$76.51. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether CF Industries Holdings's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether CF Industries Holdings has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. CF Industries Holdings has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 15% of its income after tax. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether CF Industries Holdings generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 13% of its cash flow last year."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", 'Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising.

CF Industries Holdings earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky ""beep-beep"". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.\'', ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. CF Industries Holdings has delivered 20% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid CF Industries Holdings? We love that CF Industries Holdings is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. CF Industries Holdings looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", ""In light of that, while CF Industries Holdings has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can skip it and go directly to 5 Countries That Gave the Most Foreign Aid in 2023.', 'Governments of developed and established countries help other countries in need through foreign aid. Mostly, this is to form alliances and develop friendships as countries.\xa0In the year 2022, as per the latest data available from the OECD database, the member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) gave a total foreign aid of $211 billion to developing countries and those in need of urgent humanitarian aid. ', ""Compared to 2021, the volume of foreign aid had increased by 17% in 2022. Note that volume does not equate to provision of capital. That's because foreign aid comes in various forms, including gifts, grants, loans, food supplies, services, medical assistance, training services, peacebuilding, infrastructure building, healthcare, or humanitarian assistance, by one or multilateral countries or international institutions. Moreover, according to the rules set by OECD’s DAC, the first-year costs, such as accommodation, food, health, and education, spent on asylum seekers or refugees by the host country can also be considered official development assistance (ODA).\xa0"", 'Foreign aid can also be fiscal and military, which is considered one of the significant sources of foreign exchange. While it may seem odd for a country to aid another country with military services, it primarily demonstrates goodwill. One of the most common reasons why countries give out foreign aid is to help developing countries fight poverty, and that clause comes under the Official Development Assistance (ODA) program. The main source of ODA comes from bilateral grants from one country to another, including loans channeled by International and non-governmental organizations.\xa0', 'Sometimes, countries offer foreign aid to another country to improve their own security. For instance, when a hostile government tries to take over politically friendly countries or goes to war with them, helping the countries with military and financial assistance improves the donor’s security. A good example of this was seen during the Russia-Ukraine war. According to the Media Govt report, the United States has sent a total of $44.2 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine to help the country win the Russia-Ukraine war. Another common reason behind giving foreign aid is to accomplish a political aim, such as getting diplomatic recognition in a region.\xa0', 'Whatever the purpose behind it may be, almost every country either provides or receives foreign aid. However, generosity is not compared by how much total volume of aid a country gives. Rather, it’s compared by how much foreign aid a country gives per capita (See: 25 Countries that Give the Most Foreign Aid Per Capita), or the ODA/GNI scale, which measures what percent of Gross National Income a country spends on aid.\xa0In 1970, the United Nations set the target of ODA/GNI at 0.7% for every developed country and has been re-endorsing it since. In the list below, we’ll discuss countries that gave the most foreign aid in 2023 as measured by the ODA/GNI scale.\xa0 The primary goal of the 0.7% ODA/GNI target is to help developing countries achieve economic stability.\xa0', 'Interestingly, governments and international organizations are not the only entities to help another country. Some companies also engage in helping countries in dire need. Leading companies like American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) generously give back to society in charities that go worldwide.\xa0', 'American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) has adopted a Global Giving Strategy, where they focus on spreading breast cancer awareness, disaster relief, and donating to NGOs that work in humanitarian causes. Similarly, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) globally donates 1.3 billion dollars to NGOs dedicated to anti-hunger programs. From food, refrigerated trucks, and other logistics, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) donates to make this world a better place.', ""Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) does similar philanthropic work, donating generously to humanitarian aid reliefs. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) also assists underserved communities to participate in college programs in AI and Robotics.

So we're changing that game."", 'BRAD SMITH: The latest theory is that the two hip hop moguls rejected a proposal by Post Foods to buy the cereal outright according to the lawsuit filed on Tuesday.

To skip our detailed analysis of the retail sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Discount Retailer Stocks to Buy.', ""The US economy's consistent battle with inflation has resulted in consumer spending habits being reshaped and transformed. Where once the shopping season saw consumers succumbing to higher prices as long as they brought back high-quality products for themselves and their loved ones, the fourth quart of 2023 saw a new trend emerging: bargain hunting."", 'Deloitte published an Emerging Retail Trends Report for the fourth quarter, which delved into the rise of this new trend. According to the report, US consumers are now seeking value in their purchases and avoiding high-priced items. They are beginning to ""hunt"" for bargains and deals, often frequenting discount retailers and off-price stores in favor of their usual shopping haunts in hopes of meeting their new needs. As a result of this shift in shopping behaviors, discount retail companies such as\xa0Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) can be considered well-placed to benefit from this emerging trend.', 'The Deloitte report noted that while 2021 and 2022 saw luxury retailers experiencing strong growth, 2023 saw this growth slowing. The second quarter of 2023 saw huge declines in growth for several luxury brands, some even suffering drops as high as 23%. As a result of this, many of these companies were seen to be prioritizing their discount business divisions, as these were the units attracting the most consumers.', 'As mentioned above, this shift in consumer spending habits and attitudes is beginning to prove overwhelmingly beneficial for discount and off-price retailers. For instance, The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) was mentioned by the Deloitte report as a discount retailer that reported ""strong gains in profit and revenue"" in its latest earning report. In the third quarter, The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) reported a revenue of approximately $13.3 billion, growing 9.03% year-over-year and beating estimates by $183.1 million. The company has reportedly benefitted immensely because of the increase in customer traffic after the shift to bargain hunting. Additionally, with many luxury retailers now finding their stores practically empty, companies like The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) have also found themselves gaining access to premium inventory items sold off by high-end retailers.', ""The shift to off-price retailers does not mean, however, that consumers don't want high-quality products anymore. They merely want to be more cautious in their approach to shopping now. By going to discount retailers hoping to find premium products on sale, they are doing just that."", 'According to the report, the only way luxury and discount retailers can regain and retain their customers is to work on increasing customer loyalty. Acts like simplifying the return process and engaging with customers over social media helpfully can go a long way in this respect. However, the actions of some retailers after the recent holiday season have been going in the exact opposite direction. On December 26, CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" team discussed how several retail companies have begun charging return fees to their customers after the holiday season. Additionally, retailers are also now shortening the return window for items purchased online. It was noted that about 40% of retailers are beginning to charge their customers for online returns, a 9% increase from the 31% figure reported in 2022.', 'This new development in the retail sector may have emerged as a desperate bid to retain profits. However, it is likely that such policies will alienate customers rather than increase their loyalty to a certain brand. In the long run, it may be inadvisable for retail companies to succumb to such measures, as the Deloitte report clarifies. The Squawk Box team also seemed to agree with the report in noting that ""nothing would disrupt customer loyalty"" more than placing huge return fees on purchased items.', 'Regardless of the above, it is evident that in the current market economy, consumers prefer stores that offer them products at discounted prices or as part of attractive deals. As a result, discount retailers are not only gaining popularity among the consumer base but also among investors as their profitability surges. As such, we have compiled a list of the best discount retailer stocks to buy. These include some of the best department store stocks to invest in, alongside several top discount retailer stocks for the long term.', 'Our Methodology', ""We selected the names for our list of the best discount retailer stocks to buy by consulting Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the third quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.

(NYSE:BJ) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:"", '“BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:BJ)’s is the third largest warehouse club operator in the U.S., with locations primarily along the East Coast. The warehouse club business model has many attractive characteristics, offering a limited number of items in each product category (sold in large pack sizes) which allows them to drive down purchasing costs. These companies have low operating costs, efficient distribution networks, and are typically located in low-cost areas. Their no-frills stores, simple operations, and large real estate footprints create labor efficiencies. This allows for merchandise to be offered at very sharp prices. Customers gain access to these low prices by purchasing annual memberships to the clubs, which have high retention rates and generate steady, recurring revenue. The business earns high returns on capital despite low prices and operating margins. BJ’s has a checkered history but has made significant improvements to the business over the past decade. The market remains skeptical as to how sustainable these improvements are and how well they can compete against strong peers in the warehouse club industry. We believe this misses the mark, as the club industry commands a small share of a vast retail market. We believe all of the warehouse club operators can grow and take share from indirect competitors that can’t match their pricing. If this proves out, we believe BJ’s valuation multiple should re-rate higher to better reflect the underlying strength of its business model.”', ""Like Walmart Inc.

The company’s stores offer a constantly changing selection of close-out items and other brand-name merchandise at deeply discounted prices. A steady flow of inventory acquired from distressed retailers has attracted customers to Ollie’s and boosted sales. In the company’s most recent quarter, net sales rose a better-than-expected 13.7% year over year, driven by an increase of 7.9% in comparable-store sales and the addition of six new locations. With margins and earnings also exceeding estimates, management upped its guidance for fiscal year 2023. Because the discounts at Ollie’s help consumers stretch their dollars, we think the company is better situated than most other retailers in the current inflationary environment.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30', 'At the end of the third quarter, Lee Munder Capital Group was the most prominent shareholder in Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE).', ""Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE) is a specialty value retailer based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company's discount stores offer accessories, cosmetics, personalized living space products, and more."", 'An Overweight rating was maintained on shares of Five Below, Inc.

But the stock was down because upcoming quarterly margins and earnings are projected to decline due to theft and expenses associated with theft prevention.

Reconciliations of which, along with other pertinent information can be found in this morning's press release and at about.underarmour.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Stephanie."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone joining today's call. Let me begin by saying that despite a challenging retail environment and consumer buying behavior that was inconsistent market to market we are pleased with the results we achieved in our third quarter, with revenue in line with our November outlook and better-than-expected earnings.As I approach my first year at Under Armour, I am genuinely inspired by the power of the brand and our commitment to the strategies we are undertaking to unlock our full potential. Following our Protect This House 3 plan launched last spring, I am pleased with our progress in driving global demand creation and our focus on evolving and simplifying our approach to connecting with consumers.I also feel good about how our efforts are shaping up to deliver elevated design and products to the athletes we serve in nearly 100 countries around the world, strengthening our ability to drive success across our largest growth opportunities in footwear, sports style and our women's business. With respect to driving U.S. sales, this remains a multiyear journey. And candidly, we have much more work to do to become a healthier business capable of returning to growth in our largest market.As detailed previously, inconsistency has permeated our U.S. business over the past years in how we go to market across consumers, customers and geographies, how our product is created and delivered with a consistent design language, channel segmentation and how we show up in our owned physical and digital businesses. With a critical mass of work underway, an additional analysis that will yield more work and decision points in the months ahead, we are on right path to addressing these inconsistencies and turning them into strength.All of this will take time, and it starts with leadership. To drive success, the right talent must be in the right places with the trust and the freedom necessary to empower execution. Bolstering our leadership was amongst my highest priorities in my first year at UA, and we've made excellent progress. Since last summer, we've added several new experienced officers to lead our product, design, consumer, supply chain and communications teams.Additionally, we named a 9-year company veteran to lead our Americas region and announced the return of the UA veteran to head our EMEA business. We have also streamlined our business to be more responsive, including our marketing functions, where we recently consolidated our global and North American teams who will report to a new Chief Marketing Officer, a search that's currently underway. This unification will bring a cleaner integrated approach to empower faster decision-making to accelerate our ability to connect more deeply with consumers.About 2/3 of my executive leadership team is new compared to last year and each of these leadership changes is tied directly to the inconsistencies I mentioned earlier. So we are making good progress and hitting challenges head on. The next steps are activating and empowering these teams to drive our strategic priorities, creating a future flywheel of operational excellence and execution that drives consistency back into our business.During the third quarter, I visited our Asia Pacific region and met with our team, athletes and retail and factory partners. Like my EMEA trip, I am encouraged by the energy, passion and effort we're bringing to our daily business. I also toured many of our North American stores to evaluate the opportunities we have to leverage our full-price locations as a premium brand showcase to further build relevance with our consumers.In the near to midterm, as we navigate a dynamic global environment, and our new leaders take time to ramp up we are focused on cost management and profitability, as we close out fiscal '24 and assess how to best to allocate our investments in the year ahead. This includes efforts to understand where and how we are putting our resources to work to drive the best possible returns and identifying which strategies will be most critical to driving demand creation over the long term, especially in North America.With more strategic deployment of our marketing resources, we continue to see positive momentum here. A great example is the Curry Brand, driven by the Curry 11 basketball shoe. And we recently launched the Dub Nation pack celebrating Stephen's commitment to the Golden State Warriors fans with unique colorways for the 11, the Curry 1 Retro and the Spawn FloTro. The Curry Brand also dropped exciting collaborations with Bruce Lee and apparel and footwear, including the new Curry SlipSpeed. And with the addition of De'Aaron Fox from the Sacramento Kings, we're looking forward to De'Aaron's first signature shoe later this year. In Global Football, we're leveling up our roster with some of the best up-and-coming talent at the highest levels of sport. We recently signed Mexican national team players, Sebastian Cordova, FC Barcelona's Fermín López and Real Madrid's Antonio Rüdiger. As we look to grow relevance in the world's most popular sport, this marks a significant move to bolster our presence. So we are very excited about the possibilities this brings in the years ahead. In American football, I want to congratulate our hometown Baltimore Ravens for a fantastic season, reaching the AFC championship game, including UA Athlete, Kyle Hamilton, who was named a first team All Pro and to the Pro Bowl in just a second year. On the college side of the game, (inaudible) finish this season with a dominant ball win powered by Under Armour performance gear on the field and had off the field Swagger with UA SlipSpeed, Heat Gear base layer, hoodies and fleece. Adding an excellent example of our evolving approach to brand activation, was last month's UA Next All-American event in Orlando. We're the best U.S. high school volleyball and football players engaged in a week of unforgettable experiences and elite level competition.As a Pinnacle Grassroots program, this provides the next generation of athletes an opportunity to elevate their physical and mental game. And of course, they were kitted out an amazing UA gear, like the all-new SlipSpeed Mega, a maximalist running shoe in Fire and Ice colorways and other products like Unstoppable pants, Infinite Pro running shoes and all the accessories necessary to excel at their sport.With a massive social media activation, the UA Next All-American week demonstrates how we maximize the authentic connection to sports culture showcasing product innovations that make athletes better and leveraging up-and-coming influencers to generate brand buzz and engagement. We have also made significant strides across social media over the past year and continue to gain traction. During this time, our Instagram followers showed strength across all UA accounts with a significant uptick in the Curry Brand.Likewise, our TikTok followers have also gotten stronger as have our engagement rates. This past quarter, our focus was elevating footwear and sports style and our strategic collaboration with external content creators and influencers meaningfully helped to amplify the impact of our social media content. To drive engagement and demand for the brand, we must deliver elevated design and products. With the appointment of Yassine Saidi as our Chief Product Officer, I am incredibly excited about the evolution and style for our apparel and footwear.Joining us just last week Yassine brings nearly 20 years of industry experience from several powerhouse brands with a deep pedigree in developing authentic performance and sportswear apparel and a reputation as a significant influencer in the sneaker market.With our Chief Product Officer and a new Head of Design in place, along with additional apparel, sneaker and branding experts, we are making significant progress in getting the right team together to ensure a balanced approach to continuing to deliver industry-leading performance innovations on pitch, field and court with an ability to attack the massive sports sell opportunity more effectively.Given our product creation cycle, it will take time for this newly led team to start driving more critical mass into the equation, yet we're not hitting pause until then. We have a lot of newness to be excited about as we head into spring, summer '24, especially in apparel. Over the past few quarters, we've made substantial progress in style consolidation and leaning into premium as we started to place smaller run capsules and reposition existing products within our Sportstyle offering.Although early, we are excited for fresh updates of our key apparel franchises to hit shelves later this spring, including the Unstoppable Air Vent, a new bag year on-trend silhouette of our classic woven pants. Additionally, an expanded line of our soft and versatile Meridian performance apparel is due out this spring. With stylist flattering products for women, including body suits and tanks that she can wear from the classroom to practice and from the gym to the office. Next is an update to our iconic warm weather base layer with super light heat gear compression shirts and shorts that wick sweat from maximum performance, receiving new and improved fits, colorways and styles for more versatile occasions.Our retail partners are excited about this evolution and bookings for this product are strong, especially our women's products. Speaking of our women's business, we were honored to have received 2 Women's Health Fitness Magazine awards. Our UA SmartFarm Evolution mid sports bra received the best sports bra overall and our Women's UA Reign 6 training footwear was also recognized. We are proud of these wins, which help drive more incredible momentum in this business, especially as we expand our Sportstyle offerings. Shifting to our ability to harness innovation for our athletes in the planet, I'd highlight our collaboration with Celanese, a global chemical and materials company in developing a new fiber for performance stretch fabrics called Neolast. This incredibly innovative fiber has the potential to offer our industry a high-performing, more sustainable alternative to elastane or spandex, which has recycling challenges.With the first apparel products due out later this year, we believe Neolast fiber could have a transformative impact on Under Armour in the textile industry. Next is footwear, which remains our single most significant growth opportunity, and we know we have a lot of work to do here. During the third quarter, our footwear business was down 7% in part due to a tougher prior year growth comparison of 25%, but also due to softer demand, primarily in North America.In the rearview, we recognized some of the inconsistencies from our past are showing up in our current results. However, we believe these challenges are near term in nature, and we continue to look forward by evolving our footwear strategies and investments to support our long-term growth expectations. Rounding out our product leadership changes, a search for a new head of footwear is also underway, further emphasizing our commitment to having the right talent to drive the right results in the years ahead.Leveraging our knowledge of knits, expertise in midsoles and innovative cushioning, we have made good headway in our approach to our running footwear. As a highlight, our Velociti and Infinite running franchises are getting important updates for spring/summer '24 with base, pro and elite styles to cover our good, better, best segmentation. In this spirit, we are intensely focused on franchises identifying where we can land and partnering with our wholesale customers to scale our footwear business more effectively. Shifting next to our Americas business and much work remains. During the third quarter, our North American business was down 12%, which I will note was in line with our expectations and reflective of a challenging wholesale environment in the U.S. and softer demand. Here, we remain focused on serving our retail partners and working with them to optimize our assortment and segmentation, ensuring greater overall consistency and profitability.In our North American DTC business, I'd highlight that underneath flattish results in the quarter, we are encouraged by specific operational gains made during the crucial holiday period. These included exceptional customer service scorecards, elevated talent across our fleet and significantly improved in-stock levels. Thus, our work to become a better retailer is beginning to shine through.We are also progressing on our new full-price brand house design and are set to test a smaller, easier- to-navigate format with a more premium and curated product positioning. One of the bright spots for our North American DTC business continues to be our UA Rewards Loyalty Program with encouraging member engagement and spending trends. Our enrollment has hit nearly 3 million members, which is well ahead of the target we set for fiscal '24. Our members continue to show a higher premium purchase frequency than nonmembers in these early months.We drove engagement during the third quarter via our first-ever members week, along with 8 members-only holiday campaigns, which directly contributed to peak holiday business. We are also working to improve our digital business. Given that our North American e-commerce channel has been tempered during fiscal '24, as we turn to fiscal '25, we are exploring plans to reduce our promotional dependence to create a more premium online presence. Simply put, ua.com will become a showcase for our brand. We have done a lot of work to make our website more functional to increase conversion, but we must create a more premium shopping experience to elevate the brand.Closing out North America, we recently appointed Kara Trent to head up our largest region. Kara has been with Under Armour since 2015 and most recently led our EMEA business to consistent double-digit revenue growth during her tenure. She is an exemplary leader and an industry veteran who builds performances teams, disciplined segmentation, optimized marketing strategies and strong wholesale relationships. As she steps into this role, I am confident that she has the right skill set, demeanor and drive necessary to put this business back on a path of top line growth over the long term. And finally, another leadership appointment is the return of 25-year industry and 9-year Under Armour veteran, Kevin Ross, who will serve as Kara's replacement in EMEA to lead that business as Senior Vice President and Managing Director. With deep experience in general management, sales team sports and product creation, we look forward to Kevin's ability to hit the ground running in one of our most successful markets.In summary, as we close out the fiscal year amid a dynamic market environment, we are incredibly focused on managing the business and making the hard but necessary decisions now to set ourselves up for a more promising future. In the near term, this is involved making several leadership changes engineered to address our areas of opportunity. In concert, we are committed to prudent cost management, including identifying and optimizing the investments in our business towards the highest returns.Over the mid- to long-term, we are confident in our ability to drive global demand creation and elevate design and product while ensuring the trifecta of product, place and promotion, are optimized to put us on a trajectory to reignite growth and deliver improved value to our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Dave for his comments on the quarter and our outlook."", 'David E. Bergman', ""Thanks, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was down 6% to $1.5 billion, which align with our outlook. On a regional basis, North America revenue declined by 12%, coming in at $915 million, which was in line with our expectations. Wholesale was down meaningfully due to challenges in our full-price business, partially offset by growth related to inventory management strategies, which included increased sales to the off-price channel.Our North American DTC business was down slightly during the quarter. EMEA revenue was up 7% to $284 million or up 2% on a currency-neutral basis. This was driven by strong growth in our DTC business related to improved traffic trends across our retail and e-commerce channels. Our EMEA wholesale business was also up during the quarter.APAC revenue was up 7% to $212 million or up 8% on a currency-neutral basis. We saw solid sales growth within our retail stores and wholesale was also up during the quarter. China was a leading contributor to third quarter growth. And finally, our Latin American business was up 9% to $70 million in the quarter or up 3% on a currency-neutral basis.From a channel perspective, wholesale revenue was down 13% to $712 million, with decreases in our full price and distributor businesses, partially offset by higher sales to the off-price channel. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 4% to $741 million due to a 5% increase in our owned and operated store revenue and a 2% increase in our e-commerce business. And licensing revenue decreased 2% in the quarter to $29 million, driven by declines in our Japanese and North American licensee businesses.By product type, apparel revenue was down 6%, driven primarily by declines in our train and outdoor businesses, partially offset by strength in our sideline in basketball categories. Footwear was down 7% due to a tough comparison and softer demand, primarily in North America. As a reminder, we had robust growth during the third quarter of fiscal '23 as a significant volume of footwear products that were previously delayed due to COVID-related factor constraints meaningfully hit the market. And finally, our accessories business was flat year-over-year.Moving down moving the P&L. Gross margin was up 100 basis points to 45.2% during the third quarter driven by approximately 260 basis points of supply chain benefits, mainly due to lower freight costs. These tailwinds were better than our previous expectation and were responsible for most of the overdrive on gross margin. These benefits were partially offset by 140 basis points of unfavorable pricing due to increased promotional activities in our DTC business, our proactive strategy to reduce inventory through our factory houses and deeper discounts in our sales to the off-price channel along with about 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency impacts.In the third quarter, SG&A expenses were flat year-over-year at $602 million. Excluding a $23 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted SG&A expenses were down 4% to $579 million. Next, operating income was $70 million. And excluding our litigation reserve expense, our adjusted operating income was $92 million, which was above our outlook of $65 million to $75 million due to the gross margin overdrive and lower SG&A.After tax, we realized a net income of $114 million or $0.26 of diluted earnings per share. Excluding a $50 million benefit from our final earnout on the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform and a $23 million litigation reserve expense along with the related tax impacts of each, adjusted net income was $84 million or $0.19 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. This came in above our third quarter outlook of $0.09 to $0.11, due to our adjusted operating income overdrive and favorability on the other expense and tax lines.Now moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, our inventory was down 9% to $1.1 billion as we trended towards normalized levels. This was in line with our outlook. And as we end the year, we anticipate our inventory to be down at a mid-teen percentage rate, which should put us close to $1 billion.Rounding out the quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $1 billion, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. And finally, we repurchased $25 million of Class C common stock during the third quarter. This concluded our 2-year $500 million program announced in February of 2022, thus retiring 45.6 million previously outstanding shares.Next, let's turn to our full-year outlook. To start, we have tightened our revenue expectation to a 3% to 4% decline for the full year, which is within our previous range of being down 2% to 4%. The shift within the range represents continued softer wholesale revenue. Breaking this down further, we now expect revenue in North America to be down at a high single-digit rate versus the previous expectation of a 5% to 7% decline. And we now expect our international business to be up at a high single-digit rate versus the previous low double-digit rate increase.From a product perspective, we expect our apparel and footwear businesses to both be down at a low single-digit percentage rate for the full year. Next, we expect gross margin to be up 120 to 130 basis points versus our previous expectation of a 100 to 125 basis point increase. This improvement is related to supply chain benefits and lower-than-expected full-year sales to the off-price channel.Moving down the P&L. Full year SG&A should be flat to down slightly, which is unchanged from our previous expectation. Dropping this through, our reported operating income is expected to reach $287 million to $297 million. Excluding the company's litigation reserve, adjusted operating income is expected to reach $310 million to $320 million. Putting it all together, our reported diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.57 to $0.59, which includes a $0.12 after-tax benefit from our final earn-out on the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform and a $0.05 negative impact from our litigation reserve. Excluding these net positive impacts of $0.07, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.50 and $0.52. So to close, we remain encouraged by our evolving strategies to turn our inconsistencies into strengths. At the same time, we are maintaining a cautious view of the market, and we will continue to work the levers of our P&L to deliver appropriate financial performance while positioning the company for long-term growth. That means managing our supply chain to maximize gross margin opportunities, tightening expenses, optimizing investments, focusing on cash management and making prudent capital expenditures in the near to midterm. Without question, there is much work ahead of us and we look forward to sharing more specific details on our year-end call in May, where we will provide our initial thoughts on fiscal '25.That said, we have confidence in our market sector and that our work will proactively set us up to return to creating value for our shareholders. And with that, we finished our prepared remarks, so I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital Markets.', 'Simeon Avram Siegel', ""Nice progress, guys. So Stephanie just wondering if you could share a little bit more on your broader color on how you're viewing North America landscape. Maybe how are you guys thinking about when you think about the proactive inventory management. I feel like you're in a good place and maybe versus competition. Just any color there. And then if we can just -- any thoughts on freight and promotions embedded in the full year guidance?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Sure. So I'll start, and then and Dave, I'm sure we'll jump in. And good morning Simeon, thanks for your question. As it relates to North America, as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, the softness in North America is largely being driven by wholesale. And as the year went on, we saw continued softness in that channel, including at-once and replenishment wholesale orders. That's a big piece of the puzzle in North America. And then if you really particularly look at the holiday time frame, there was quite a lot of promotional activity that impacted our performance and others. As it relates to inventory, I'll turn it to Dave in a second, but our inventory continues to trend to be in a much better place. For Under Armour in the industry overall, I'd say, though, that doesn't necessarily mean there'll be no promotional activity that really ties to demand. So there's not always that one-to-one correlation. I think people think could be the case. So I think we're really, really excited about the game plan we have for North America. I'd highlight, again, Kara Trent coming back to lead that business. She has a great track record from her time in EMEA. Terrific leader, terrific relationship with wholesale partners, disciplined segmentation, great targeted marketing efforts that have been driving the brand in that part of the world. And we know she's going to bring those same skills and leadership back when she starts her role in about a week here in North America. So we're excited about the work underway and our efforts around marketing, product and distribution, which I'm sure we'll get into in -- further in the Q&A. But Dave, why don't you weigh in on inventory, that specific question?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. I mean I think you covered the inventory pretty well in that the market, we think, is coming back to normalization at this point, maybe a little bit longer to go, but pretty close. However, we are still seeing a fairly promotional environment out there even with the inventory levels at the retailers in a lot better place. So I think the retailers are being fairly cautious and still really trying to keep clean after a year or two of obviously having more than they wanted. So we do see some of that promotional impact on gross margin continuing a little bit. And so you asked a little bit about freight and promotion relative to our assumptions on the full-year outlook or essentially Q4. And I would say that from a freight perspective, we've seen the rates normalize pretty well at this point, and they had really stopped with the big increase in our fiscal Q4 of last year. So when we think about Q4 of this fiscal year as we finish out the year, we're kind of at a more stabilized freight rate in Q4. So that's not going to be a huge tailwind for us in Q4. However, we are starting to work more deeply with our inventory vendors and have made a lot of progress on some of the costing initiatives there, which we're seeing some of that benefit favorably for Q4 of this year. And then I did mention relative to the promotion levels, we do anticipate it continuing to be more promotional than normal for a while here. And so we're continuing to expect that in our full year forecast as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jay Sole, UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""My question just a little bit on Europe. If you could just maybe touch on that business, how the wholesale channel there is looking if it's different than sort of the comments that you made about the U.S.? And then Stephanie, I'd love to hear a little bit more about the product innovation pipeline, what you see coming over the next couple of quarters and really into the Olympics perhaps. Would love to hear your view on that."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes. Sure, of course. As it relates to EMEA, in Europe, we are -- that is -- continues to be a strong market for us. The brand is doing very well there. That being said, we mentioned this in the remarks, we're seeing a little bit of cooling there with the consumer, particularly in Eastern Europe and some of our distributor markets. But again, the European market, particularly in England and Spain and France, is very strong for us. Let me touch on product, and I'll let Dave jump in on Europe as well. But on the product side, I mean, we have a lot to be excited about. With Yassine just started last week, but we're super excited to have him as our new Chief Product Officer. And of course, as we've shared with you about 5 months ago, John Varvatos joined us as our new Chief Design Officer, and there's just a lot of exciting things happening on both the apparel side and the footwear side. So let me hit a couple of things that we're excited about on the apparel side. We continue to see a lot of traction with our Meridian product for women, where we're really winning with women is in legs -- or sorry, it's bottoms and tops and particularly with bras. We're having a lot of success there. I mentioned that we've got some exciting new things coming with our Unstoppable franchise that's really going to be terrific. And our core base layer really has some new upgrades in terms of fit and colorways and we're excited about that on the apparel side. On the footwear side, we have some real traction with Curry and the Curry 11, excited about what's happening with our running footwear, in particular, with our Velociti Elite and Infinite franchises. As a quick reminder, the Velociti Elite running shoe was worn by last year's New York City's Marathon winner, Sharon Lokedi. She wore again this year and came in third place with only a couple of seconds off the top spot, which is remarkable. So that Velociti running shoe is a real winner at the highest levels of performance and running. And then on the Infinite shoe, we've really reimagined the HOVR technology, which is incredible cushioning. And so we have a base, pro and elite level with that shoe really hitting that segmentation of good, better and best. So we're excited about that. But we're just getting started. Again, Yassine just started last week and we've got an amazing team here that's put -- has some great innovation pipeline, but we're excited to see what Yassine in partnership with the new head of footwear when he fills that position, that search is underway, and of course, with our design talent. So we're excited with what we've got in the product pipeline. I will say it's worth noting that it will take time, though. When we think about the product creation cycle in terms of any real mass of new product, I think we're looking at spring/summer 25-plus just given the product creation cycle that we're dealing with. But Dave, do you want to jump in with any additional color on Europe?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""I mean I think the only thing maybe that I would point out is we have a lot of strength moving forward in Europe, which is great to see. I think one of the points that is a little bit of pressure is just some of the Red Sea shipping disruptions do impact us a little bit there. And that is part of what went into our outlook tightening is that we see about a 1 point headwind from the Red Sea impacts, and that's primarily related to EMEA. And then obviously, there's some geopolitical challenges in that region as well that we're dealing with. So we're working through that. And that's really what I'm mentioning that 1 point headwind that's really talking about fourth quarter and how do we see it finishing out the year."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""I'd add one more thing on the product side, just really quickly, I should have mentioned because it's getting a lot of traction is with our SlipSpeed Mega, which we did a soft launch at the UA All- American game, we did a soft launch there. We have a very cool activation at the Super Bowl this weekend, but the SlipSpeed Mega it's a very cool shoe that I think is really resonating with consumers. So that's another highlight on the footwear front."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu, BNP Paribas.', 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""I was hoping to drill down on North America wholesale. If possible, could you possibly quantify how down North America wholesale was for the quarter or just your expectations for the year, so the audience can better understand the dynamics within this channel. Are you starting to see -- are you starting to have conversations with North American retailers regarding restocking of inventories, particularly for the back half of 2024. And then just, Dave, on that point on the Red Sea, I understand there's some delays, but can you maybe just share with the audience how you -- how much you're contracted out? And when you renegotiate your contracts with the shipping merchants?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. So I guess a couple of things. North America wholesale is definitely a pressure point. We've talked about that. We've talked about kind of the softer orders as we saw coming in through fiscal '20 -- or fall/winter '23 and also a little bit relative to spring/summer '24. We haven't been quantifying the actual percentage for the channel within a region, but definitely is a pressure point, and we're continuing to see an experience where our DTC channels in North America are performing much better than where we are with wholesale. I think again, the retailers are being very cautious right now even though the inventory levels at retail are in a much better place. And that's why we're continuing to see some of the promotional levels as well. When you think about the Red Sea impacts, we are seeing some impacts there from shipping disruptions mainly impacting EMEA. The impact includes some increased shipping costs as well, not just some delays. And to kind of think about that, about 20% or so of our global apparel comes through that area, so it is meaningful to us. We're mitigating that through regional air freight, adjusted shipping lanes, differing forward buys, PO prioritization, et cetera. So -- and with all that, we don't really see any concerns with daily operations of our inventory vendors in that region. But again, we are estimating for Q4 about a 1 point revenue headwind because of the delays and mainly the impact on the EMEA region, and that's considered in our tightening of our outlook for the full year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robert Drbul, Guggenheim.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""Stephanie, just I guess, a bigger picture question for you, but you've made a significant amount of new hires, new leaders since last summer, when I look at the list and think about it Chief Design Officer, Supply Chain Product Officer in Americas. When you think about all these new leaders in the organization, how should we think about the time it will take for the organization to actually absorb the leadership changes, the impacts on the culture, the execution, eventual change and field of the years ahead?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""During my first year, my top priority was building out the right team and to build out the right team to address some of the inconsistencies and challenges that we've had in the past. And you're right, there's been a lot of change. Let me just put a little more color around it. This is -- I've been in the job for about 11 months coming up on my first year. But since last summer, we filled the following jobs. Let me just tick through them quickly. Chief Consumer Officer, Jim Dausch, season Marriott executive, a lot of experience in products, marketing, sales and brand; a new Chief Communication Officer, Amanda Miller, came from PayPal, bringing us real PR horsepower; new Chief Design Officer, John Varvatos, great experience with his own company, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Converse; a new Chief Supply Chain Officer, Shawn Curran, a 30-year veteran at the Gap who was most recently the COO at Old Navy, but held various positions at that company over the years; a new Chief Product Officer Yassine Saidi, who started again last week, as I mentioned, coming from some powerhouse brands and most recently, owning his own company, so he's got that entrepreneurial spirit. A new President of the Americas just starting Kara Trent, industry and UA veteran. We talked about how spectacular she's going to be in her new role. I mentioned that Kevin Ross will backfill Kara and EMEA, a 25-year veteran of the industry knows UA, was with us for 9 years, but experienced at Taylor Made and Yeti in addition to Under Armour. We did also -- I didn't mention this, but in my remarks, we did hire a new SVP of direct-to-consumer for the Americas last summer too Josh Denton, who came -- Under Armour veteran, who came back to us, and we have an open CMO role and a new head of footwear that I covered in my prepared remarks. So when you put all that in the blender, that is a lot of change in roughly 6 months. What's terrific is, again, these executives who all have really incredible backgrounds have hit the ground running. I'm so excited to see how well they're working together. Interestingly, Yassine and Kara work together for close to 9 years at Puma. So to have the Head of North America and the Head of Product already have a deep working relationship between the two of them is terrific. Of course, when you think about executives like Kevin Ross and Josh Denton coming back, they know UA. So this team has hit the ground running, but they do need time to settle in, get their teams organized. I should underscore too, we have amazing talent at Under Armour already that these leaders are joining. Really deep experience, particularly in terms of performance apparel, performance footwear. So we've got a great team in Under Armour. We brought these critical new roles in. Most of when you think about it on a forward-facing part of the business. I put supply chain in there, too, because we can't get things to the right place at the right time they won't be delivered to the customer. It's got quite a lot of work underway on the supply chain front under Shawn's leadership. So it's going to take some time, but to get going, but I'm confident that we have the right team, we have the right strategy and we're firing on all cylinders. So I'm excited with the amount of progress we've made on the talent front in less than a year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sam Poser, Williams Trading.', 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""I've got 3, and I'm just going to read them all out. One, when we think forward, do we anticipate that the SG&A is going to go down? And then you mentioned the Olympics, is that going to be like pump up of investment sort of at the end of Q1 into Q2 of next year? And then two is, what's the base of -- like what's the base sales you look at for North America? Are we close to it? And then on product, it's like use of logo, you've got some good stuff going on with some of the Unstoppable apparel, the Fat Tire, the Forge 96, that really don't scream with the big UA logo and seem to be doing generally better than most out there of the non-Curry product. And I just wondered sort of directionally how you're thinking of logo use and stuff like that and maybe optimize -- exploiting some of those styles that are sort of quieter don't make the list that often, but appear to be -- have pretty good demand."", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes, Sam, this is Dave. I'll take your first 2 questions, and then maybe I'll hand off to Stephanie on the logo. Relative to SG&A and going forward, obviously, this is an area that we continue to focus on. We worked hard over the past few years to become more agile from a cost structure perspective. But we do have more work to do. We understand the areas of highest returns, and we're continuing to validate those and also understand where the best investments need to go. So this is a continual work in process. We continue to drive further savings within our hiring, our incentive comp, tightening up our marketing prioritization, spending, travel and entertainment, et cetera. And we're going to continue that work as we drive into next year. So could we drive SG&A lower? Potentially and that's our focus is to be able to be as optimized as possible, and we're going to keep working with that. Relative to North America, I think your question is, how we hit kind of base sales level for North America? And I would say that's kind of a loaded question because there's a lot of decisions within that. And we know that we want to be -- continue to strive to be more premium. We know that we want to make some right choices as far as backing off some of the deeper discounts, for example, on our on our website. So all of that goes into the blender as we think forward. And as we get to our May call, we'll be getting into much more details on kind of fiscal '25 and beyond. And then as far as you mentioned the Olympics relative to SG&A. And is that going to be a heavy investment? Obviously, we're going to activate some things around the Olympics, but it is not a large investment for us, so it shouldn't be a big pop in SG&A for us in any way. Stephanie, do you want to take the third point on logo."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""On the logo front, I mean, you highlighted some of our best-performing franchises when you mentioned Unstoppable, I'd put Meridian in their base layer. And I think our design teams always do a terrific job of finding the most appropriate and elegant and stylish way to place our logo and so we'll continue. That's in the very able hands of Yassine and John Varvatos as we think about logo treatment. I think there's a broader point I'd like to make, though, around where we're headed with Sportstyle because I think that, that is going to be a really important part of our story in the years to come.And let me define Sportstyle again. We are not trying to be anything other than authentically Under Armour, and performance is in our DNA. It always will be. So for us, Sportstyle is that intersection of performance and style and they're inextricably linked. And I think what you'll see from us and we're thinking about Sportstyle is really more of an evolution versus a revolution. And we started with Phase 1, which is remerchandising and remarketing products to demonstrate kind of that nonactive use occasion. And some of the franchises you mentioned, Unstoppable, Meridian, would be great examples of where we have an opportunity where we have great, particularly on the apparel side, Sportstyle offerings, but we need to market them differently, and we're doing that. And then Phase 2 is really when we'll see more new product. We've already done some limited run capsules and some smaller collections or groupings of items. But again, it's not until spring/summer 25-plus where we think we'll see more mass in terms of new product, given the product creation cycle. But again, throughout all of that, our talented design teams will be figuring out the best way to place the Under Armour logo for maximum return. So again, we're excited. We're excited about where we're headed with product and including the best use of our logo."", 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""Just one last thing. I mean, the one thing about the logo is that like on the forge and some of these other ones, they are more -- they're there, but they're more discrete. So it makes the shoe more flexible rather than having the big Under Armour logo on the side of the shoe, which then makes it more active. Having it more discrete seems to -- would make it more style regardless of what the design of the shoe is or apparel for that matter."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes. Again, I think it depends on what's the particular item and what's its use. And so we'll continue to always be evolving and looking at the best way to -- like, I think, like all world-class brands, the best way to use our logo. But you gave an example with a couple of items where it was more less smaller, but I think we'll continue to evolve and work on that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.', 'James Vincent Duffy', ""Stephanie, prepared remarks and comments are fairly deliberate about your subdued expectations for the North American marketplace, the timing for inflection. Can you give us some perspective on what you're hearing in your discussions with wholesale partners? What are their forward thoughts on consumer spending behavior what's the messaging on subdued orders despite what seems to be pretty well managed channel inventories? What are they asking of Under Armour at this point? And then I have a question on D2C."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes, I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to Dave to add his perspective. And when we talked about the pressure that we're seeing in North America this year. And as we think about heading into fiscal year '25, I think we can see some anticipated continued bumpiness when I think about the fall/winter '23 order book that, of course, has an impact on the order book coming up. I should note, we're in the middle of it right now. So we're not going to comment on fiscal year '25 in any detail today. But I think it's fair to say for the first part of the year, we'll see some continued bumpiness. Dave can jump in on that. But I think what we're working very, very closely with our wholesale partners to make sure that we have the right assortment and we are continuing to work with our wholesale partners as we deliver more better and best products to make sure that we get those better and best products on their shelves. And so there -- our wholesale partners are incredibly important to us. When I think about our strategy on that side of the house, it really is all about getting more shelf space and better product in our existing partners, but then opening new doors of distribution too on the wholesale side. And that ties to having new product offerings. So that is an important part of our business. I think, again, with -- and particularly in North America with Kara, coming back to lead our charge there. She has tremendous relationships with wholesale partners. I think that's going to just further bolster our success in this area. But I know you had a question on D2C, but let me let Dave jump in on wholesale, if he wants to add any other information..."", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. I mean, I think we've talked, as Stephanie mentioned around kind of the environment and the continued discounting, which is a little bit of a headwind. I would say the other thing is we're kind of finishing out the year moving into next year is, again, we are looking to try and push harder into more premium distribution. We've got some good early reads on mall penetration and new doors there, which is good. And then also, we're going to continue to edit and improve our segmentation as well as we move into next year. But again, it is a little bit bumpy out there still, and it's still a pretty promotional environment."", 'James Vincent Duffy', ""Then just quickly on the D2C. You spoke to your intent to be less promotional in North America D2C that seems to suggest you're planning for declines in fiscal '25, lapping more promotional comparison fiscal '24. Is that a fair assessment?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes. So Jim, we're not going to get into details on fiscal '25 yet, but I will say as it relates to our own D2C channels. Let me start with our website and our shop app. We've made a lot of progress on the functional side of that channel, things like improving mobile speed to better search algorithms, upgrading product description pages, et cetera. So there's been a lot of great work done on improving conversion and having a more functional website and shop app. At the same time, and I think this is where you're headed, we do have plans to reduce our dependence on promotions. We need for ua.com and our shop app to be the most premium expression of our company. It's our largest storefront when you think about it. So we are going to reduce our dependency on promotions. Could that have some reduction in revenue? Yes, it could. But at the same time, it will lift ASPs, it will drive profitability and it will lead to a much better, more premium experience for our customers. So that's one piece of the D2C channel. The other part is our stores, our physical stores. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that we have a great effort underway to reimagine the Under Armour brand health of the future, a smaller store format, curated with more premium offerings and easier to shop experience. We're going to be piloting new concept later this year with a goal to roll out more full-price brand houses in the years ahead. We know that our ratio of factory to full price brand houses is not where we want it. So there's a lot of effort underway to think about our physical space as well. And we all know that the -- those two are inextricably linked, meaning the physical and the digital. So we've got a lot of great work underway on the direct-to-consumer front, as it relates to the future."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tom Nikic, Wedbush. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.', 'Kelly Crago', ""This is Kelly on for Paul. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the gross margin. It looks like you're guiding up 200 basis points or so in the fourth quarter and you mentioned some costing initiatives. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that. And if there's any sort of raw material deflation that is benefiting you guys and whether that can continue into F '25? And then on the freight side, while it's no longer going to be a benefit, is there any chance with some of the Red Sea pressures that freight could become a headwind to the gross margin in the next 12 months based on what you're seeing today?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. Kelly, this is Dave. Relative to Q4, there are definitely a few puts and takes that we're seeing there. We do expect some continued supply chain benefits in Q4. And that's -- but that's shifting a little bit more towards the product costing initiatives that we're working on with our vendors that we're going to starting to see those benefits in this Q4 and then looking to see full year benefits next year. The freight component, obviously, we saw pretty substantial tailwinds in Q1, Q2 and Q3 of this year. But again, those have kind of normalized for Q4, so not as much of an increase year-over-year for Q4. Now to your point, relative to the Red Sea, we are seeing some increased shipping costs, but we're probably in the neighborhood of $1 million or $2 million there, not something that is significant at this point. So we're managing through that and that's all considered in our tightened outlook as well. And then a couple of the things that are going to be a little bit of headwinds for Q4, we do believe that the kind of promotional environment is going to continue a little bit longer. So that's assumed in our Q4 as a headwind and potentially a little bit of FX pressure. So those are kind of the main puts and takes as we think about Q4."", 'Kelly Crago', ""Got it. And just lastly for me. Any way to quantify or could you quantify for us the percentage of your off-price sales this year, particularly within North America and how that's trending relative to historical?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. We've worked really hard over the last few years to really get our inventory management into a good spot and manage the off-price channel in what we feel is a pretty healthy range. And so we were targeting in the 3% to 4% of global mix of third-party liquidations and that's generally where we're running. In fact, as we finish out this year -- this fiscal year, we'll probably be at the lower end of that, 3% to 4% total mix. Relative to North America, it's not that different, but we don't really get into the mix per region per se."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.', 'Lance Allega', ""This will be our last question -- so Alex, I'm just going to let everybody know this going to be the last question, so I appreciate it. But go ahead, Alex."", 'Alexandra Ann Straton', ""So Stephanie, you noted a lot of leadership changes. I just want to drill down on kind of how you think about when they can start to have an impact on the P&L from a time line perspective? And then also, in the meantime, as understanding that can't be done immediately. What are the KPIs in your view that you're watching that we should be watching for signs of some of these initiatives flowing through?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Sure, of course. Well, these leaders have hit the ground running. So I think they're impacting the business right away. I don't want to tick through each one of them again, but for example, I use John Varvatos is just as an example. He's been here 5 months. On day 1, he started looking at things like fit, finish, trim, color. So we're seeing the leaders have an impact on day 1, but it will take time in terms of bigger, broader impact across the business. In terms of the KPIs that we're going to be looking at I mean it depends on the area, but let me hit on some that we're really focused on. In terms of the the consumer and margin KPIs, we are constantly keeping an eye on our loyalty, our UA rewards sign-ups equally important activations. I mean, the loyalty program will be the backbone of our consumer strategy. It's all about customer acquisition and all about customer activation. And I mentioned some of the good progress we're having there in terms of not only sign-ups, but increased spend from our loyalty members. And then on the marketing front, there's all sorts of leading and lagging indicators that we'll be looking at, and I'm sure over the course of our time with you sharing updates on things like search demand. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of the progress we're having with social media. We've really changed our marketing approach to be more product focused, more digital, social, always on, that's where the consumer is. And so we're always looking at the metrics on that critical marketing channel, NPS scores, increased earned media, then we'll be looking at more lagging indicators as we move forward, increased full price sales, faster sell-through of our key franchises. As we open more doors, further doors of distribution, getting into more specialty retail, seeing things like more UA sold on the aftermarket. So there's a lot of consumer metrics both leading and lagging KPIs that we'll be looking at. Then we have made a lot of good progress over the past couple of years on supply chain, but this is where we still have more work to do. So we're focused on -- Dave touched on this, our cost of goods sold, SKU rationalization, better segmentation that will lead to ASP expansion. We'll be sharing more with you on our priority investments and the results there. So there's a whole host of KPIs and metrics across the business that we will be focused on and tracking and sharing with you is early indicators of how we're making progress along the way. Although -- I'll end where I started with, which is my excitement about the team we've built here, we have brought in some set fantastic executives to join our already fantastic team at Under Armour. So I couldn't be more excited and more thrilled with the team we're building here and our future. We've got a lot of great stuff underway. So thanks for your question."", 'David E. Bergman', 'Our teams on the field.', 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Our teams on the field. That's right."", 'Operator', ""Thank you for attending today's call for Under Armour third quarter of fiscal 2024. This now concludes today's call. Have a great day.""]"

The company has no sales growth. Its sales were down more in the quarter from last year than I expected.

And right now, their orders and sales are not that strong, and so that's affecting Under Armor's ability to manage its inventory."", ""BRAD SMITH: You know, David, we've been tracking some of the announcements from athletic footwear specific companies and the innovation that some of them are trying to put forward this year and take to market, whether that's new entrants like Lululemon finally getting into men's footwear, and then you've got Nike with Airmax DNn, which that comes ahead of Air Max Day. You've also got the chunky soles at HOKA on running. We could go down the list. What is innovation from Under Armor look like this year, and is that something that investors can hang their hat on?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: I don't see a lot of innovation from Under Armor right now. And to be honest, it doesn't look like the company is really planning that much this year. A lot of the real product development cycle is really geared towards 2025 it seems like at Under Armor. We've been warned about this. The company is going into more casual sports rather than its traditional performance sportswear."", ""But it has explained to us that it's going to take some time for that to happen. The company has a designer. John Varvatos used to be a pretty well-known fashion designer on his own who's now the lead designer for Under Armor."", ""But we've been told that it's going to take some time for his products to actually reach the market given the long lead times in this industry, which can be as easily 18 months from the time that a product is designed to the time that it actually reaches consumers. So I don't think we're going to see a lot of innovation really in the short term for Under Armor, and I think that's part of the reason why the stock is depressed."", ""SEANA SMITH: David, do you think it's time for a brand reevaluation? I bring this up just because we're in the midst of a turnaround. You're saying it's going to take longer than maybe initially anticipated here to play out. Should Under Armor be further adjusting its business given the shift that we're seeing in consumer spending?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: Under Armor really has been in a turnaround situation for about seven or eight years now. So there have been a lot of changes, and I think some of them have been positive. I don't think it's the situation where the company needs to panic in any way. Under Armor does have a strong cash flow this year. Its inventories are much better. Its balance sheet is very good. The company has minimal debt."", ""So Under Armor really is not under any great pressure to turn things around right now. The stock price is clearly low. You're in the single digits, and that's a concern. But the company itself is not in any risk of distress. It's really just a matter of trying to generate top line growth again which has been Under Armor's problem for years.""]"

You can only go so far in predicting the future, and it is possible something unforeseen can derail a seemingly solid business plan.', 'Still, the closest thing to a forever stock is arguably about Realty Income (NYSE: O). The real estate investment trust (REIT) plays an understated but crucial role in the economy. It owns more than 13,250 properties, spanning 85 industries and five countries.', ""Additionally, it has struggled since the pandemic and sells at a 36% discount from its 2020 high. Given its client base and the nature of its business, it's a company with a lucrative, growing revenue base poised to provide investors with a rising dividend for decades to come."", ""Admittedly, Realty Income may not be a household name, as consumers often set foot on its properties without knowing. Instead of owning properties, companies such as Wynn Resorts, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Walmart, and FedEx utilize Realty Income's space."", ""Moreover, the company operates under net lease agreements, meaning that the tenant pays for insurance, maintenance, and taxes. This helps reduce Realty Income's expenses, increasing the profits for the company and its shareholders."", 'In many cases, Realty Income will buy properties owned by such companies and lease them back to the previous owner. This provides the customer with cash while becoming an income source for Realty Income.', ""Furthermore, Realty Income continues to provide the types of properties the market demands. With only 159 properties available for lease, its occupancy was just under 99%. This tight market prompts continued expansion; it acquired 104 properties and had 185 additional properties under development in the third quarter of 2023. This and the rent increases included in its contracts mean Realty Income's revenue will likely continue rising."", 'Investors should also remember that the company\'s REIT status requires it to pay at least 90% of its net income in the form of dividends. However, payouts are more than an obligation to Realty Income, they\'re a centerpiece. It bills itself as the ""monthly dividend company,"" and its payouts have risen at least once per year for the last 30 years.', 'The monthly dividend now stands at $0.2565 per share, or just under $3.08 per share annually. That amounts to a yield of almost 5.8%, more than 4 times the S&P 500 average of 1.4%.', ""Additionally, Realty Income can sustain this payout. Over the last 12 months, the company reported $4.15 of normalized funds-from-operations (FFO) income, a measure of a REIT's free cash flow. This gives it enough cash to maintain and increase its payout while investing in new properties."", ""Admittedly, recent struggles with the stock have helped raise that yield. Over the last few years, lockdowns and, later, rising interest rates weighed on the stock and its industry. Realty Income's P/E ratio of 40, which is well above S&P 500 averages, may also deter investors."", ""Nonetheless, the P/E ratio has rarely fallen below 40 in recent years. Also, because it's a REIT, FFO is arguably a more meaningful metric to the company. For the trailing 12 months, its price-to-FFO ratio is only about 13, meaning its valuation is likely much lower than its P/E ratio implies."", 'Ultimately, Realty Income is arguably the closest thing possible to a forever stock. The company owns the real estate\xa0where a significant amount of consumer-oriented business occurs. With that, it has developed a virtuous cycle of property additions and rising rents to foster stock price and dividend increases.', ""Moreover, with a low price-to-FFO ratio and higher interest rates, investors benefit from buying at a discount. As time passes, rising stock prices and dividend payouts should bring significant returns to Realty Income's shareholders."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

MSIM launched its ETF platform in February 2023 with six Calvert-branded ETFs and expanded the platform in October 2023 with one Parametric-branded alternative income strategy, one Parametric-branded hedged equity strategy, and the three Eaton Vance-branded fixed income strategies. The platform has over $600 million in assets under management as of February 2, 2024.', 'About Morgan Stanley Investment Management', 'Morgan Stanley Investment Management, together with its investment advisory affiliates, has more than 1,400 investment professionals around the world and $1.5 trillion in assets under management or supervision as of December 31, 2023. Morgan Stanley Investment Management strives to provide outstanding long-term investment performance, service, and a comprehensive suite of investment management solutions to a diverse client base, which includes governments, institutions, corporations and individuals worldwide. For further information about Morgan Stanley Investment Management, please visit www.morganstanley.com/im.', 'About Morgan Stanley', ""Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services. With offices in 41 countries, the Firm's employees serve clients worldwide including corporations, governments, institutions and individuals. For more information about Morgan Stanley, please visit www.morganstanley.com."", ""Before investing carefully consider the Fund's objective, risks, charges, and expenses available in the prospectus, please download one at https://www.eatonvance.com. Read carefully."", 'Risk Considerations: There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Loans are generally associated with fixed income securities risk and are traded in a private, unregulated inter-dealer or inter-bank resale market and are generally subject to contractual restrictions that must be satisfied before a loan can be bought or sold. These restrictions may impede the Fund\'s ability to buy or sell loans (thus affecting their liquidity) and may negatively impact the transaction price. It may take longer than seven days for transactions in loans to settle; therefore the Fund may hold cash, sell investments or temporarily borrow from banks or other lenders to meet short-term liquidity needs. Loans to entities located outside of the U.S. may have substantially different lender protections and covenants as compared to loans to U.S. entities and may involve greater risks. Loans may be structured such that they are not securities under securities law, and in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by a borrower, lenders may not have the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Loans are also subject to risks associated with other types of income investments. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In addition to fixed income securities risk, asset-backed securities are subject to the risk that various federal and state consumer laws and other legal and economic factors may result in the collateral backing the securities being insufficient to support payment on the securities. Some also entail prepayment risk and extension risk, and may become more volatile in certain interest rate environment. Collateralized loan obligations carry additional risks such as the Fund may invest in CLOs that are subordinate to other classes and the complex structure may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results. Distressed and defaulted securities are speculative and involve substantial risks in addition to the risks of investing in high yield securities, which are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. The Fund will generally not receive interest payments on the distressed securities and the repayment of principal may also be at risk. These securities may present a substantial risk of default or may be in default at the time of investment, requiring the Fund to incur additional costs. Mezzanine investments are subordinated debt securities, thus they carry the risk that the issuer will not be able to meet its obligations and that the mezzanine investments may lose value. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Portfolio Turnover. Consistent with its investment policies, the Fund will purchase and sell securities without regard to the effect on portfolio turnover. Higher portfolio turnover will cause the Fund to incur additional transaction costs. Active Management Risk. In pursuing the Portfolio’s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies to use. The success or failure of such decisions will affect performance. ETF Structure Risks. Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. The Portfolio has a limited number of intermediaries that act as authorized participants and none of these authorized participants is or will be obligated to engage in creation or redemption transactions. As a result, shares may trade at a discount to net asset value (""NAV"") and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. Cash Transactions Risk. Unlike certain ETFs, the Fund may effect creations and redemptions in cash or partially in cash. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the Fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in shares may be less tax-efficient. Trading Risk. The market prices of Shares are expected to fluctuate, in some cases materially, in response to changes in the Portfolio\'s NAV, the intra-day value of holdings, and supply and demand for Shares. The Adviser cannot predict whether Shares will trade above, below or at their NAV. may pay significantly more or receive significantly less than the Fund’s NAV per share during periods when there is a significant premium or discount. Buying or selling Shares in the secondary market may require paying brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. New Fund Risk. A new portfolio\'s performance may not represent how the portfolio is expected to or may perform in the long term. In addition, there is a limited operating history for investors to evaluate and the portfolio may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.', 'Eaton Vance, Parametric and Calvert are part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.

(NYSE:OMC) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 3.7% to US$86.63 in the week after its latest full-year results. Omnicom Group reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$15b and statutory earnings per share of US$6.91, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group ', ""After the latest results, the eleven analysts covering Omnicom Group are now predicting revenues of US$15.6b in 2024. If met, this would reflect an okay 6.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to rise 8.6% to US$7.63. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$15.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.75 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$100. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Omnicom Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$117 and the most bearish at US$79.00 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. For example, we noticed that Omnicom Group's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 6.2% growth to the end of 2024 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 0.8% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 3.3% annually. Not only are Omnicom Group's revenues expected to improve, it seems that the analysts are also expecting it to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$100, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Omnicom Group.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.', 'Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.', 'Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.', 'One company to watch right now is Omnicom Group (OMC). OMC is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.', ""Another valuation metric that we should highlight is OMC's P/B ratio of 4.66. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 11.70. Over the past year, OMC's P/B has been as high as 5.32 and as low as 3.79, with a median of 4.65."", ""Finally, our model also underscores that OMC has a P/CF ratio of 11.03. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 11.24. Over the past year, OMC's P/CF has been as high as 12.48 and as low as 8.98, with a median of 11.01."", ""Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Omnicom Group is likely undervalued currently.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren ', ""Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Ralph Lauren's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 53%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Ralph Lauren achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 2.8% to US$6.6b. That's progress."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Ralph Lauren.', ""We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$9.5b company like Ralph Lauren. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$2.9b. That equates to 31% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors."", ""Ralph Lauren's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with RL.', ""Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL), a paragon of luxury lifestyle products, has recently unveiled its financial performance for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024. The company's SEC 10-Q filing on February 8, 2024, presents a financial tableau that reflects a robust trajectory. Net revenues have escalated to $1,934.0 million, marking a significant increase from the $1,832.3 million reported in the same quarter of the previous year. This uptick is mirrored in the net income, which has surged to $276.6 million from $216.5 million. The basic and diluted net income per common share have also seen a commendable rise. This financial overview sets the stage for a comprehensive SWOT analysis, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of Ralph Lauren Corp's strategic positioning."", ""Brand Prestige and Heritage: Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) stands as a beacon of luxury, with a brand that resonates with timeless elegance and premium quality. The company's heritage, built over decades, has cultivated a loyal customer base that associates the Ralph Lauren name with aspirational lifestyle products. This brand equity is a formidable asset that differentiates RL from competitors and allows for premium pricing, contributing to the company's strong gross profit margin, as evidenced by the $1,286.0 million gross profit reported in the recent quarter."", ""Global Distribution Network: RL's extensive global distribution network is a testament to its strategic market penetration. With a mix of retail stores, wholesale channels, and a growing e-commerce presence, RL has crafted a diversified revenue stream that mitigates reliance on any single market or distribution channel. This network's effectiveness is reflected in the company's ability to generate substantial revenues across North America, Europe, and Asia, ensuring a stable financial base and resilience against regional market fluctuations."", ""Operational Costs: Despite its strong brand and revenue growth, Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) faces challenges in managing operational costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses have climbed to $967.6 million, up from $900.8 million in the prior year's quarter. This increase, if not curtailed, could potentially compress operating margins over time, necessitating a strategic review of cost structures and operational efficiencies."", ""Market Sensitivity to Economic Trends: RL's position in the luxury segment makes it susceptible to economic downturns, where discretionary spending is often curtailed. The company's performance is influenced by consumer confidence and spending power, which can be volatile in the face of economic uncertainties. As such, maintaining growth in a potentially recessionary environment poses a significant challenge for RL, requiring adaptive strategies to sustain consumer engagement and spending."", ""Digital Expansion: The ongoing digital transformation presents RL with a lucrative opportunity to enhance its e-commerce capabilities. With consumers increasingly favoring online shopping, investing in digital platforms can drive revenue growth and expand the company's reach. RL's ability to capitalize on this trend is crucial, as evidenced by the growing importance of digital commerce operations in its overall sales mix."", 'International Growth: Emerging markets offer RL the prospect of tapping into new customer segments and driving international revenue. By leveraging its strong brand image, RL can expand its footprint in high-growth regions, potentially offsetting slower growth in more mature markets. The strategic opening of new retail stores and concession shops, coupled with targeted marketing efforts, can harness the spending power of burgeoning middle-class populations in these markets.', ""Competitive Retail Environment: The luxury retail sector is fiercely competitive, with numerous brands vying for consumer attention and loyalty. RL must continuously innovate and differentiate its product offerings to maintain its market position. The pressure of staying relevant in a market with rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences is a constant threat to RL's market share and profitability."", ""Global Economic and Political Uncertainties: RL's international operations expose it to risks associated with global economic and political instability. Factors such as currency fluctuations, trade tensions, and geopolitical conflicts can disrupt supply chains and affect consumer spending patterns. The company must navigate these complexities to ensure business continuity and safeguard its financial performance."", ""In conclusion, Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) exhibits a strong financial foundation, bolstered by its prestigious brand and extensive global distribution network. However, it must address operational cost challenges and remain vigilant in a luxury market sensitive to economic trends. Opportunities for digital expansion and international growth are ripe for the taking, while competitive pressures and global uncertainties loom as persistent threats. RL's strategic initiatives in response to these dynamics will be pivotal in shaping its future trajectory."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

This holiday quarter, our campaigns around the world celebrated a season of giving, marked by warmth, reflection and comfort that inspires people to dream of the best things in life and share them with those they love. Immersing people in our world of easy elegance and sophistication has epitomized Ralph Lauren over 57 years. And we continue to deliver this quarter after quarter to an ever-expanding audience to our next great chapter accelerate plan. This combination of magic and logic translated to strong financial performance in the third quarter, our biggest quarter of the year. With top and bottom line results that exceeded our expectations, along with significant EPS growth. As we continue to navigate a dynamic global operating environment, our teams remain keenly focused on what we can control. This starts with our timeless and highly desirable brand, which is resonating with consumers all around the world and enabling continued pricing power in the market. Our ability to leverage a broad powerful portfolio of core products that we can flex with evolving consumer needs. Our continued deliberate shift toward our direct-to-consumer channels where we can best deliver our elevated and connected consumer experiences and which once again led growth in the quarter. And all of this is underpinned by the agility and operational discipline we have built into our business so that we can continue fueling our strategic growth initiatives for the long term. As we outlined at our last Investor Day, we are strongly encouraged that we have built a sustainable and resilient model with multiple diversified drivers for long-term growth and value creation. Our third quarter performance was a clear example of how we're driving progress across our three strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights across each of these areas. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to harness the power of our iconic brand as we expand across geographies and demographics, cutting through culture across fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming and music moments. During the third quarter, key campaigns included: first, our holiday season for dreaming activations in every region generating nearly 8 billion global impressions. These included immersive holiday gifting content, unique key city takeovers across New York, Shanghai, London and Berlin. And our Singles Day stream in China. Second, our Polo Ralph Lauren Artist in Residence campaign featuring Navajo designer, Naiomi Glasses, which is the first in a series of groundbreaking partnerships focused on empowering and celebrating artisans within the communities that have historically inspired our designs. This campaign was not just a galvanizing cultural moment for our organization, but also resonated strongly with consumers, driving more than 3 billion impressions and our highest engagements ever on TikTok. We also outfitted an incredible roster of inspiring women including America Ferrera, Jody Foster, Greta Lee and J. Lo at the Elle Women In Hollywood event. Janelle Monáe and Kate Bock at Art Basel in Miami. And Gauravi Kumari, Princess of Jaipur for a high-profile fundraiser at the dazzling city palace in Jaipur, India. And who could forget Taylor Swift, who chose an all-American Ralph Lauren look for the cover of Time magazine as their 2023 Person of the Year. These activations helped to fuel our strongest quarter of new consumer acquisition and brand affinity since the pandemic. We added 1.7 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, up high single digits to last year, driven by all regions. Our Net Promoter Scores accelerated along with positive momentum in brand consideration and purchase intent. And we grew our followers on social media by low double digits to last year, led by TikTok, Instagram, WeChat and Douyin. Moving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Consumers continue to turn to brands they know and trust and styles that live on beyond one season. And this holiday was no exception. As Ralph and our design teams seamlessly married sophisticated casual with styles exuding the luxury and glamor of the season. Our iconic core products, representing about 70% of our business, grew low double digits in the quarter, ahead of total company growth. From our Mesh Polos and Oxford Shirts, to our luxuriously soft Cashmere Sweaters and versatile blazers, we have established a broad and highly recognizable portfolio of icons that drive our business through both choppy and more stable times alike. And we are incredibly proud of the work Ralph and our creative teams are doing to drive newness and excitement behind these styles, so they appeal to our most loyal and new consumers alike. Performance in core was led by our cable knit sweaters in cotton woolen cashmere, quilted and down jackets and sports coats in the range of tweed, tartan Platt, stretch corduroy and party-ready velvets. As we continue to build on the long-term foundation of our core, we also delivered strong growth in our high-potential categories, including women's, outerwear and home. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits to last year. This was led again by women's, our most significant long-term growth opportunity. Driven by an elevated assortment with AUR up mid-teens. Performance was supported by our cashmere, flag and polo bear sweaters, sophisticated wool and cashmere coats, blazers and heritage tweed and modern knit tools and cocktail and evening dresses. Other special releases this quarter included our Polo Country and Element Skateboards Capsule, a limited edition collection of unisex Polo Country styles and Element Skateboards celebrating the great outdoors. We sold over 2,000 skateboards, highlighting the lifestyle reach of our brand, and appeal to younger consumers. Our limited edition Polo ID handbag collaboration with Mr. Bags in China, which sold out within one minute on WeChat. Our innovative love of the land collaboration with Navajo Designer, Naiomi Glasses; Ralph Lauren's first artist in residents. And the annual and much loved Ralph Lauren Pink Pony collection supporting Ralph's 30-year commitment to cancer care and research. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive our core icons while leveraging the breadth of our brand and assortments to fuel excitement, and desirability. Turning to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world drive elevation and deliver consistency through all of our consumer channels and touchpoints. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites, which combined already represent about 2/3 of company sales. During the quarter, we drove accelerated comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets. Globally, we opened a total of 17 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities with the majority again in Asia. While comps in our Ralph Lauren stores and own digital sites were strong around the world, we were particularly encouraged by the continued improvement in our outlet trends. The key outlet actions we implemented in the first half of the year from our optimized staffing to assortment enhancements and emphasis on quality and value, served us well through holiday and will continue to be drivers as we look ahead. In addition to our existing fleet, we opened a select number of iconic Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, including our new emblematic store at Singapore's Marina Bay Sands, the first door to offer our luxury collections in Southeast Asia. Our first Ralph Lauren store in the Czech Republic, in Prague's historic old town as well as in Charlotte, North Carolina; and our first Ralph's coffee shops in Paris and the UAE. We also launched our Ralph Lauren digital flagship site in Canada, following our Toronto store opening last quarter. Combined with our elevated wholesale presence, these are helping us introduce a cohesive connected retail experience to our consumers across the Canadian market. By region, growth was again led by Asia with particularly strong performance in China, where sales increased more than 30% this quarter on both comp and new store growth. This was ahead of our expectations, even with last year's easier compares due to the surge in COVID cases. We are still in the earlier stages of brand building in China with meaningful outperformance versus peers in the quarter on consumer KPIs, including brand awareness, consideration and Net Promoter Scores. Our team delivered another successful Singles Day focused on brand building with ralphlauren.cn sales up 25% on lower discounting and higher AURs to last year. Our early performance to date on Douyin has also been very encouraging following our limited launch last fall with an expanded rollout this spring. And finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. As we drive towards best-in-class digital technology and analytics, we tested our sophisticated predictive buying model in our European and Asian stores this quarter. With our initial rollout limited to select sweaters, knit tops and caps, this artificial intelligence-driven model enables better in-stock availability on sizing and best-selling products to drive incremental sales and improve conversion. Based on this early success, we plan to continue scaling its use to an expanded range of categories and markets over time. As we continue to integrate citizenship and sustainability to future-proof our business, we are also proud to be named once again one of Forbes World's Best Employers in 2023. In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's excellent execution through this important holiday season. This quarter's performance reinforces how the power of our iconic brand, together with our multi-lever strategy delivers. We are firing on multiple cylinders while not dependent on a single geography channel or category for growth. And this model, combined with our unique agility and the remarkable dedication of our teams is what will continue to differentiate Ralph Lauren through these dynamic times. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."", 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We entered this holiday season with a clear game plan. We invested in brand momentum around the world, expanded giftable core and seasonal products to delight our consumers and drove key operational improvements and flexibility to mitigate near-term macro headwinds. This quarter's strong performance was a testament to the agility of our teams and the resilience of our next great chapter accelerate plan, coupled with the power and global reach of our iconic brand. We reported third quarter revenue, adjusted operating profit and double-digit EPS growth above our outlook. And we achieved this while continuing to strengthen our brand proposition around the world and investing in our key strategic priorities to enable sustainable growth into the future. Top line exceeded our guidance, driven by comp acceleration in DTC with momentum in all retail channels globally. Operating margin expansion was also ahead of our outlook despite our strategic investments and ongoing cotton headwinds as we focus on operating with discipline in an evolving global environment. And we returned approximately $425 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year-to-date, in line with our long-term guidance. Let me take you through our third quarter financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Our accelerating brand momentum and investments in key holiday campaigns resulted in 5% total revenue growth. This was above our outlook led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and holiday outperformance in Europe. Revenue in North America was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations. Each of our DTC channels contributed to top line growth in the period, with total DTC penetration expanding approximately 400 basis points to last year, adding stability and resiliency to our business, consistent with our NGC strategy. Total company comp increased 9%, accelerating sequentially across all three regions. Ralph Lauren stores continued to lead our global performance. Our positive outlet comps continued to improve following investments in service and expanded core product assortments, driving solid traffic AUR and basket size growth in every region. Comps in our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites increased 8% on top of 11% growth last year as we prioritize ongoing investments to expand our footprint and improve the customer experience online. Total digital ecosystem sales were also up high single digits, including a strong recovery in Europe as our largest pure-play account returned to growth. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 66.5%, reflecting our long-term elevation work. This was consistent with our outlook, driven by lower freight expense, favorable channel and geographic mix and 9% AUR growth. These more than offset ongoing cotton cost headwinds and targeted promotions to drive conversion during key holiday sale periods. Cotton costs will start to abate at the end of our Q4, beginning with our spring 24 collections. As previously indicated, we are planning a moderation in AUR growth based on a reduced need to pass like-for-like cost inflation onto the consumer. Nevertheless, we plan to continue driving positive AUR increases, as a result of our growing brand desirability, ongoing product mix elevation and favorable geographic and channel mix. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% to 50.2% of sales a 100 basis point increase to last year. The increase as a percent of sales was driven largely by channel and geographic mix shifts in the quarter. With our DTC and international businesses contributing a significantly higher share of sales in the period versus last year. This quarter's strategic investments focused on our key city ecosystems, marketing investments and enhancing the consumer experience and service levels across our DTC channels. Variable selling expenses also rose as a result of stronger retail sales growth. Marketing was 7.5% of sales, up slightly from last year to support our high-impact holiday activations, delivering improvement across our consumer metrics, including brand consideration, Net Promoter Scores and purchase intent. We still expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Third quarter revenue was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations as stronger growth in retail was offset by our reduced sell-in to the wholesale channel. In North America Retail, third quarter comps increased 5%, led by a double-digit increase in our Ralph Lauren stores. Our outlet performance continued to improve with positive comps driven by our product elevation and our recent interventions to improve the selling experience and retail environments. Despite taking targeted promotions during the key holiday periods, our outlet AUR increased strongly and discount rates declined versus last year. Comps in our owned ralphlauren.com site were up 4% on top of 9% growth last year. In addition to a strong response to our Black Friday event, recent site enhancements such as upgraded search and navigation drove higher conversion in the quarter. We also launched our Canadian digital site in the quarter. In North America Wholesale, revenues decreased 15%, in line with our expectations as we proactively focus on aligning inventory with softer demand trends. We continue to evaluate our brand presence in each store and exited approximately 20 department store doors this year. While we plan to manage this channel carefully into calendar '24, we were encouraged by our improving sellout trends, which meaningfully outperformed our sell-in this quarter. Our AUR in the channel was also up on a year-over-year basis. Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 6%, with performance led by our DTC channels. This was above our expectations as strong growth across the continent more than offset continued consumer and macro headwinds in the U.K. Results included roughly 5 points of negative impact from the earlier timing of wholesale deliveries and lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances. Retail comps increased 11% on top of a strong 11% compare last year with similar performance in our brick-and-mortar and digital sites. We drove strong momentum across brands and categories in Europe, with growth led by gifting, seasonal sweaters and outerwear, which are AUR accretive. Europe wholesale was approximately flat to last year, but included about 11 points of net headwinds from unusual impacts of wholesale allowances and earlier receipts. Strong underlying growth was supported by wholesale reorders, which returned to more normalized trends in the quarter, following recent destocking at digital wholesale accounts. While our Europe business has performed better than expected through the first three quarters of the year, we remain cautious on the fourth quarter and into fiscal '25, given highly dynamic geopolitical and macro conditions in the region. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 17%, with double-digit growth across our largest markets of Japan, China and Korea. Asia retail comps were up 14% with strong growth in both digital commerce and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased more than 30% on continued brand momentum, including successful Singles Day events as we lapped last year's COVID impact. Third quarter sales in Japan were up low double digits. Overall inbound tourism recovered to prepandemic levels. Although Chinese travelers to Japan are still down 70%. Sales in Korea also rebounded to low double-digit growth, benefiting from our recent marketing activations and a shift in the timing of the Chuseok holiday from Q2 last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows are key enablers of our Fortress foundation and allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory decreased 15%, below our revenue growth trend with units also down double digits. The decline was driven by stronger-than-expected Q3 sales and our continued efforts to ensure healthy wholesale inventories. As we transition into spring, we believe overall inventory levels are well positioned relative to our outlook for each region. We still expect to end fiscal '24 with healthy inventories below prior year levels with an improved ability to chase into potential demand as a result of our predictive buying model. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending-related headwinds, potential supply chain disruption and foreign currency volatility among others. For fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, now centering on about 2% compared to our previous outlook of 1% to 2%. Our outlook continues to embed caution around the wholesale channel where year-to-date demand has been softer than prior year. Foreign currency is now expected to benefit revenue growth by about 10 basis points. We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have a roughly neutral impact on full year operating margin. We now expect gross margin expansion in the range of 140 to 180 basis points in constant currency, up slightly from 120 to 170 basis points previously. This is driven by favorable freight costs, further mix shift toward international and DTC and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting full year cotton inflation. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset expense deleverage due to mix shift and key strategic investments. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to increase in a range centered around 2% in constant currency, with stronger trends in retail versus continued caution in wholesale in both North America and Europe. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 160 basis points. While we remain cautious on North America, we expect modest sequential improvement in Q4 with stronger trends in DTC offsetting continued softness in wholesale. In Europe, fourth quarter sales are still expected to be negatively impacted by the earlier timing of wholesale shipments. Excluding this impact, we expect underlying trends in Europe to increase slightly in Q4. And in Asia, we anticipate growth will be closer to our full year guide for the region of up, low double digits. As we lap a more normalized compare following the easy COVID compares in Q1 and Q3. We expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand approximately 350 to 400 basis points in constant currency. Largely driven by gross margin expansion with about 40 and 50 basis points of negative foreign currency impact on our operating and gross margin, respectively. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% for the full year due to discrete tax benefits recognized in Q3 and roughly 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter. And capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $200 million to $225 million. In closing, Ralph's vision has always been about inspiring people to step into the dream of a better life. And this holiday quarter was no exception. We are proud of our team's strong execution on our next great chapter accelerate plan through what continues to be a highly dynamic operating environment. We are focused on what we can control, shifting to DTC, harnessing big data and AI and of course, operating and balance sheet discipline. This puts us in a position of strength as we continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) First question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', 'Congrats on a great quarter.', 'Patrice Jean Louis Louvet', 'Thank you, Matt.', 'Corinna Van der Ghinst', 'Thanks, Matt.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', 'So Patrice, relative to mixed results across retail, Ralph Lauren clearly stands out as a winner over the holiday period here. What gives you confidence that you can maintain this momentum in a volatile backdrop? And then, Jane, any constraints to achieving the mid-teens constant currency operating margin target as we think about next year? And maybe as we think multiyear, is -- do you see this as a ceiling for the business? Or how best to think about longer-term operating margin opportunity?', 'Patrice Jean Louis Louvet', ""Thank you for your question. What I would say is resilience is built into every facet of our approach so we can stay on offense as we pursue sustainable long-term growth. So what gives us confidence? A few things to call out. First, we continue to invest in our brand and our way of living so that we can continue to deliver cut-through cultural moments and drive desirability across regions and demographics. Listen, our focus on high-impact Q2 and Q3 marketing really enabled us to hit the ground running coming into this holiday season. And it helped accelerate consumer metrics, top line outperformance and the continued elevation in what I think we can all say was a pretty promotional environment. The second point is really around our products, right? And our broad portfolio of iconic core products, transcend trends, really focused on style and elegance, not on trends and allow us to flex as consumer needs evolve. The third area regard to our go-to-market model and our DTC channels. In DTC, I think as you know well, now represents about 2/3 of the company. So a majority of the business is DTC for Ralph Lauren. And the DTC channels are really where the world of Ralph Lauren comes to life most powerfully, where we engage most directly with the consumer and have the most ability to impact the consumer experience. And that's where we've invested most. And we delivered healthy comp growth across all of our direct-to-consumer channels this quarter, including our Ralph Lauren stores, our own digital sites and outlets in Asia, in Europe and in North America. So as you've seen, our plan is supported by multiple drivers of growth. It's not based on a single area, but diverse opportunities across categories, across channels, across key cities in every single region. And I think this is really evident from Q3 with double-digit growth, not just in China, up 30% in China. We're really proud of the team doing that. But also proud of the work our teams are doing in Japan, Korea, Germany, where we grew double digits in this quarter as well. And North America, which saw positive comp results across our DTC channels this quarter as well. Our core product is working. That's about 70% of the company. Women's and high potential categories more broadly are also working. So this is underpinned by our agility and operational discipline muscles, which have been built over time. And I think you see them in action during this last quarter. You can see the way we're managing our inventories. You can see the way our diversified global supply chain is helping us navigate volatility all around the world. And we expect this to continue to serve us really nicely moving forward, knowing that volatility is really our new normal. So, Matt, our model is resilient. It's differentiated. We've created a sustainable approach for long-term growth and value creation in these dynamic times. And I'll let Jane provide perspective on margin."", 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""Yes, Matt. So we are still firmly committed to our 15% constant currency operating margin. We think it's the right goal for our businesses. And specifically to your question, do I see any constraints? Obviously, we're operating in a volatile and dynamic operating environment. We're not immune to that. But what gives me confidence is our organization's agility to address those changes, navigate them effectively and lean into our multiple engines of growth, be it different geographies, be it different products, be it different channels that we drive. As you saw us drive DTC this quarter so effectively. And I don't view 15% as a ceiling at all. That's why we've identified these high potential categories in women's handbags and planting seeds in homes that those businesses can scale over the longer term and provide new engines for growth and profitability."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""I guess a couple tactical ones. North America, 15% wholesale decline in the quarter. Nice to see you guys controlling it where you can in the D2C business. On that number, though, I think you said POS in wholesale was well ahead of sell-in on wholesale. But it sounds like AURs are increasing in the channel and you're maintaining a cautious posture there still. Is there a point on the horizon where you see those two numbers can start to converge, Jane a little bit? And also, I guess, Europe as a stand out here. I want to make sure I understood the 11% growth rate would have been 5 points higher in the quarter that comes out of the fourth quarter. But even with that, it looks like you're planning for a deceleration in Europe in the fourth quarter. I know you've been planning that market very cautiously for a long time. It's nice to see you coming in above your guidance. But is maybe a little bit more context on what you think the underlying growth rate is in Europe in the fourth quarter and how we should think about that market for '24? Are you seeing any less pressure on the wholesale side there? Maybe just a little bit of color, please?"", 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""Sure. Let me start with the first -- your first question on wholesale. So we did see our sell-in down 15% in North America. What's encouraging is that our sellout was down about mid-single digits in the quarter. And we had low single-digit increases in AUR. Now Michael, what's underscoring that is we wanted to be competitive, we didn't intend to be moved backward in that channel through the holiday season. We were intentional about our sell-in as we came off a softer spring and fall, we wanted to make sure that our receipts reflected a more cautious view of seasonal inventory, and we were able to backfill into stronger core and replenishment items. So as I look into the future, especially in the fourth quarter, I see more balance between sell-out and sell-in. And I think the expectation of what we saw in sell-out this quarter is a good indicator of what we'll see in Q4. And then on Europe, we were really pleased with what we saw in Europe this quarter. Overall, our business performed above our expectations. We had solid growth in every market with some softness in the U.K. based on the inflation and some consumer pressures that we had there. But really, we saw strong continued full digital pure-play strength as well as good wholesale strength with accelerating DTC trends. So some of the investments that we've talked about specifically in North America also paid dividends in Europe as we invested back in-store service and really saw marketing momentum with our new consumers. As I think about Q4, we do remain cautious. It's an inflation-pressured environment. Obviously, the situation in the Middle East and the situation in the Ukraine are closer in on Europe. I see some pressures in Europe and in Spain with inflation. But I do see that over the course of the quarter that what you'll see in wholesale is the underlying growth is going to be pretty stable. And then we're going to come in, as we talked about in Europe with some ups and downs and some timing shifts that we expect Europe to perform in the low single-digit range for the year. Again, I know there's some quarter-to-quarter volatility based on timing shifts."", 'Patrice Jean Louis Louvet', ""And maybe I'll just add one data point on your first perspective, which is on North America wholesale where indeed need to be cautious moving forward. We are encouraged by our digital wholesale performance this past quarter, which was up mid-single digits. So the challenge really is stores, driving traffic in the stores, running conversion in the stores working closely with our wholesale partners to activate this."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', 'Great. So maybe, Patrice, just to follow up on those last comments. Can you just talk about your enthusiasm for your direct consumer business, particularly opening stores, given the comments you made in the opening remarks? Can you maybe just compare where -- how you feel about it now versus, say, 90 days ago?', 'Patrice Jean Louis Louvet', ""Those enthusiastic, Jay. So if I step back a little bit, just think about our go-to-market model, really focused on top 30 cities around the world building an ecosystem that is led by DTC, but incorporates quality wholesale within that. And we know, as we look at our footprint, particularly in North America and in Europe or in China, actually, that we have opportunities to expand our full-price store presence. And you've seen us do this at a relatively healthy clip probably most actively in China, but more recently in Europe and in North America. As we think through the model going forward, Jay, we're still going to operate with this focus on the top 30 cities, build this ecosystem and lean into DTC. So I mentioned earlier, DTC is about 2/3 of the company. We expect that percentage to increase over time. Because that's really where we have the opportunity to better engage with the consumer and provide a full raw foreign experience. This being said, quality wholesale continues to play a role in the mix moving forward. We've committed to a number of store openings during Investor Day, and we still stay true to that. But this year, it's about 80 stores."", 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""And we're still on track for about 250 new doors over the 3-year time horizon."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.', 'Brooke Siler Roach', 'Healthy improvement in the outlet channel again this quarter. And I know a lot of ground has been covered on DTC, but I was hoping you could elaborate on the changes that are working best there and your plans for further actions to drive continued accelerated improvement from here in outlet in both North America and Europe.', 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""Yes. So, Brooke, we were really pleased with what we saw in the outlet channel. And what we see working is that the investments that we've made in our brands are paying off across our channels. But it's particularly in the outlet channels, we've seen nice solid growth in traffic across all three regions. Additionally, some of the very targeted promotion activities that we did during the peak holiday selling period worked very effectively, especially in the outlet channel. And we're able to do that while still increasing AUR across all three regions. We also see a role for the investments that we made in service. So we increased our service in our stores, and we're seeing conversion as a result of that. Obviously, brand investments and service investments are durable groups over time. And as we said, we'll be led by our consumers on our elevation journey and be very targeted in addressing some of our value-oriented consumers over time."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas.', 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""Jane, I think you mentioned for the fourth quarter, the operating margin on a constant currency basis will be up 350 to 400, that's largely driven by gross margins. If I recall correctly, Jane, the commodity -- the turn of the commodities into our tailwind doesn't really happen until the last month of the quarter. So I'm just curious to know like how -- what the drivers are for that gross margin for the fourth quarter? And then if you could possibly for the audience, maybe quantify how much cotton was a headwind over the last few years. Is it fair to assume that it was about 300 basis points cumulatively? And if that's the case, how do we think about that as it turns into a tailwind?"", 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""Laurent, thank you for the question. So you're right. We've guided 350 to 400 basis points largely driven by that's the equal guidance that we gave in gross margin. So it's driven by gross margin. And so SG&A becomes a neutral factor. And we still will have over 100 points of tailwind from freight, even with consideration of the resi as we come into the fourth quarter. So that's a durable factor for us as we exit this year. We're going to have favorable benefits from channel and geographic mix. Similar -- about similar, I think, to what you saw this quarter. And then the big change -- there are two big changes. The big change is that cotton becomes a tailwind at the very end of the quarter. It's been a meaningful headwind over the course of the year of about 110 basis points. So as it becomes a tailwind, the pressure that we felt from cotton has reduced significantly. Also AUR growth becomes a more powerful driver in gross margin. As we expect our AUR trajectory to be about similar, we are -- we expect to get more efficiency, especially in our promotion lever. You saw us be quite focused in the holiday quarter as we come into the fourth quarter, we'll be less focused and we have less inventory that have to go out at end-of-season sale. So that's a gross margin benefit. Cotton is still a slide -- I just want to be clear that cotton still a slight headwind in the quarter, but again, vastly reduced. And that's the key drivers that we see as I look at cotton over the last several years. It's important to note that even today, cotton is still about 25% above pre-COVID levels. So it hasn't gone down to pre-COVID levels. And I expect that, that with the best visibility that we have, that's about a stable point for cotton. But it's actually been a little less than the 300 basis points, Laurent. I would say it's been about 110 basis points this last year and a little over 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the previous year."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America.', 'Christopher Michael Nardone', 'Just wanted to know how to think about the impact your operating margin next year in a scenario where wholesale sell and starts to improve globally. And then I heard you loud and clear on reiterating the 15% constant currency target for operating margins next year, but can you provide an update on where we are in your cost savings program that you outlined at your Investor Day and your ability to pull that lever if sales and macro volatility continues this year?', 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""Yes. So Chris, what we see as we talk about a more balanced focus between sell-in and sell-out, next year, we think that, that it will be a favorable dynamic in terms of OI margin expansion, and we can couple that with the momentum that we're seeing in our DTC channel. So we view that as favorable. Although in aggregate, we're still cautious about the channel as we enter into fiscal '25, but we don't expect to see the level of sell-in decline that you saw, particularly in North America this quarter. And then from our $400 million gross savings plan, we are on track for that plan. We delivered about 1/3 of it in fiscal '23. We'll deliver another 1/3 in fiscal '24. The difference between '23 and '24 is it's a little more balanced in our cost of goods sold line versus the SG&A line. And we feel we're on track delivering the full $400 million as we close out the year. And of course, we'll be very disciplined about resource allocation. We've made some significant investments this quarter and this year, and we'll expect those investments to scale in a year to growth and profitability as we go into fiscal '25."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen.', 'John David Kernan', ""Congrats on the results, the 9% comps and another strong quarter. Just, Patrice, you talked about women's, home, accessories, handbags, in particular, as incremental growth categories. Can you remind us where we are as a percent of the mix with some of those categories and how those have trended since you put out the targets for the next great chapter plan in 2022?"", 'Patrice Jean Louis Louvet', ""John, we haven't guided specifically in terms of the relative percentages. We did say that the women's opportunity was quite meaningful. 56% of our customers walking into our stores or shopping into -- on our website are women and yet women's has represented less than 25% of the company's business. So you can expect that percentage to go up, but we haven't guided specific breakouts. We do have a lot of confidence in the potential of these categories. We're really pleased with the customer response across our women's portfolio. Women's really led the dance this quarter again and really resonating nicely. Outerwear is also a category that we're leaning in. You've heard others say, the season was challenging and certainly, the temperatures were maybe a little milder than anyone would have liked. But outerwear outperformed for us again this quarter, teams doing a great job developing a line of products across different outerwear categories that's really resonating. And as we look ahead, we still see a lot of runway, particularly on women's outerwear. Moving forward, strong performance with our handbag business. We launched the RL 888, which was hard to miss in a number of our key cities around the world, very nice response to that with continued momentum on the Polo ID bag and the little partnership -- or not little, but the partnership we had with Mr. Bags in China. And also good progress on home with new capability building as we bring in our new part -- the licensing partner on furnishing. All in all, all these categories are AUR accretive. So if you think about the different categories I laid out, when you look ahead in terms of what's going to be accelerators for the company, both in absolute top line and from an AUR and margin standpoint, we look forward to continuing to build on the momentum that we have in these spaces."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""And nice to see the nice results. Just as you think about your channels of growth and obviously, DTC being so much more important than wholesale, or the interesting things on wholesales, the stronger results that you saw in Europe this quarter with the reorder trends. Anything we should be thinking about the wholesale business and reorder trends in Europe and what it could mean for North America? Is there anything to parse apart on North America? And then just lastly on the whole digital side of the business, what are you seeing in terms of the mix, whether it's -- is it AUR growth? Is it new customer activation? Is it more from existing customers and how you see that growing as a percent of sales?"", 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""So just in terms of what we saw in Europe on -- in wholesale, we were really pleased with what we saw overall in wholesale, especially as we look at Europe growth on an underlying basis, where it was even stronger. I think what -- as we step back the differentiator in Europe is the wholesale channel itself is more elevated. And our Ralph Lauren consumer is also more elevated. And that doesn't mean we don't have learnings that can apply in North America. I think as we look at assortment composition and as we look at marketing opportunities with our wholesale partners, Europe has some great best demonstrated practices and there's certainly an opportunity to cross-pollinate those issues. But those are the primary differences in what we see in terms of performance."", 'Patrice Jean Louis Louvet', ""And then, Dana, on the digital front, let's start with North America. So North America comps were up 4% digital. It was really driven by traffic, all right? That was the key traffic. We saw improvements on conversion basket size. What's really exciting in the new consumers that we are recruiting, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're up 1.7 million new consumers this last quarter is the momentum we have on brand is attracting higher value younger consumers, and we're seeing that play out very clearly in digital. If I look at the other regions, we were super pleased with the performance in Europe with digital at 12%. This was also driven by very strong traffic during the holiday events and new capabilities that the teams have put in place there. And then finally, Asia, which is a smaller base and newer flagships also a very strong momentum, up 25% versus plus 21% last compare. And I think same thing new consumers, higher-value consumers, younger consumers, progress on conversion. And listen, as we look at this channel for the future, we still see significant runway, right? This business is a little less than 30% of our total company. We had guided to continued acceleration within this channel. As we build new capabilities, we just launched a new search engine in the U.S. also we mapped our product presentations, we expect to see continued progress in this space. So we feel good about the results that the teams are achieving across all three regions with more to come."", 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from Rick Patel with Raymond James.', 'Rakesh Babarbhai Patel', ""I'll add my congrats as well. How should we think about the flow-through of outperformance as we go forward? Because for the year, it looks like you raised guidance for gross margins, but less so on operating margins. So curious which areas might be getting incremental spend here? And then secondly, just zooming out, which areas of the business will you look to distort investments to as we think about continuing the strong momentum?"", 'Jane Hamilton Nielsen', ""So Rick, I think as we look at flow-through on outperformance, it's really going to be about the cadence of our investments and continuing to stay focused on our productivity metrics. As you do look at flow-through especially on the gross margin line, DTC, while we've been able to -- on wholesale softness lean into DTC, which is a good thing, it is our strategy. The gross margin does have to cover some of that higher level of SG&A. We've been able to -- I think, with real agility balance that. And of course, as we look forward, we'll look at that balance between flowing through outperformance and making investments in our business. As we have looked at where to invest in our business, we're very encouraged by the investments that we've made in digital. You know that, that's an important part of our future, and we're going to continue to make those investments, equally developing our ecosystem. As I said earlier, we are on track for delivering 250 new stores over the 3-year time horizon. We believe that stores are an important part of our brand presentation and our customer service experience. So you'll see us continue to drive that. And then finally, our brand. One of the things that we are proudest of this quarter is the momentum in our brand and our underlying health with our consumer. Our NPS score was higher, our purchase intent score was higher, our value perception score was higher. And so we believe in our brand, we will always invest in it, and we think it will pay dividends not only in the short term but in the long term."", 'Patrice Jean Louis Louvet', 'All right. Well, this is the end of our call. So thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and year-end results with you in May. And until then, take care, and have a great day.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.']"

Again, in where we are with the spend with luxury and looking towards true luxury spend, it is what everyone has called quiet luxury, a much more subtle luxury. So again, in an example of Ralph Lauren where they're focusing on their core product, that's very subtle. And again, they do tap into that quiet luxury. That's where we see the spend when we compare them to results that we've seen at LVMH or other conglomerates that are luxury specific and have had gains even though they are slowing down."", ""I think luxury in general is normalizing this year and that's what we're likely to see. But they are tapping into that higher-end spend and again, that's really where we're seeing the spend in luxury rather than at the lower end.

It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$2.6b were what the analysts expected, News surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$0.27 per share, an impressive 47% above what was forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for News ', ""Taking into account the latest results, News' twelve analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be US$10.1b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to shoot up 72% to US$0.69. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$10.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.64 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on News' earnings potential following these results."", ""The analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 8.4% to US$29.20. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values News at US$36.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$22.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that News' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 2.1% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 0.9% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to see revenue growth of 3.3% annually. So it's clear that despite the acceleration in growth, News is expected to grow meaningfully slower than the industry average."", 'The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards News following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.', ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on News. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have forecasts for News going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for News that we have uncovered.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The filing indicates a revenue increase of $65 million, or 3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth is primarily attributed to the Digital Real Estate Services segment, with REA Group's higher Australian residential revenues, and the Dow Jones segment's increased professional information business revenues. However, the U.S. housing market's macroeconomic environment has adversely affected Move's revenues. The company's net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders also saw a significant rise to $156 million from $67 million in the prior year.

This diversification allows the company to mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations in any single sector. For instance, the recent revenue growth in the Digital Real Estate Services segment, particularly from REA Group, underscores the company's ability to capitalize on the robust Australian real estate market. Additionally, the Dow Jones segment continues to be a powerhouse, with its flagship products like The Wall Street Journal and Barron's attracting a premium subscriber base."", ""Strategic Cost Management: News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) has demonstrated a proactive approach to cost management. The recent announcement of a 5% headcount reduction reflects the company's commitment to streamlining operations and improving efficiency.

Such strategic measures are indicative of a strong balance sheet and a forward-looking management team focused on long-term financial health."", ""Impact of Macroeconomic Factors: The performance of News Corp's subsidiary Move has been negatively impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment in the U.S. housing market. This has led to a decline in revenues for the segment, highlighting the company's susceptibility to economic downturns in key markets. The reliance on the real estate market, which is prone to cyclical changes, poses a risk to sustained revenue growth."", ""Legal and Regulatory Challenges: News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) continues to face legal and regulatory scrutiny, particularly with respect to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The company has admitted liability in many civil cases related to voicemail interception and inappropriate payments to public officials, leading to significant legal costs and settlements. While the financial impact is partially indemnified by FOX, these issues could potentially damage the company's reputation and affect its operational capabilities."", ""Expansion of Digital Services: The growing demand for digital content and services presents a significant opportunity for News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA). The company's digital real estate platforms, such as Realtor.com, and its professional information products, like Dow Jones Risk & Compliance, are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. By continuing to innovate and expand its digital offerings, News Corp can attract new customers and increase its market share."", ""Global Market Penetration: News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) has the opportunity to further penetrate global markets, leveraging its strong brand presence and extensive media portfolio. The company's international operations, such as those in Australia and the U.K., already contribute significantly to its revenue. Further expansion into emerging markets could drive growth and diversify revenue sources even more."", 'Competitive Media Landscape: The media industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for audience attention and advertising dollars. News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) faces stiff competition from both traditional media companies and digital newcomers. The company must continually innovate and adapt to changing consumer preferences to maintain its market position.', ""Economic Volatility: Economic volatility, particularly in the real estate and advertising markets, poses a threat to News Corp's financial stability. Fluctuations in these markets can lead to unpredictable revenue streams, as evidenced by the recent downturn in the U.S. housing market impacting Move's performance. The company must navigate these economic challenges carefully to ensure sustained growth."", 'In conclusion, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) exhibits a robust financial performance with diverse revenue streams and strategic cost management. However, it must address weaknesses such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and ongoing legal challenges. Opportunities for expansion in digital services and global markets are countered by threats from a competitive media landscape and economic volatility.

The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.9%, up from 20.1% in the previous year, primarily driven by lower benefits from stock-based compensation in the current year.', 'Cash flow - The company generated $2.0 billion in operating cash flow, up 12% versus the prior year. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 14% versus the prior year. The increase in both operating and free cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings generated in the current year partially offset by higher cash taxes.', 'Capital allocation - In 2023, the company repurchased $804 million of its common stock at an average price of $278.56 per share and paid $589 million in dividends. Additionally, the company closed the acquisition of IPVideo, creator of the HALO Smart Sensor, for $170 million in cash, net of cash acquired.', 'Backlog - The company ended the year with backlog of $14.3 billion, down $88 million from the prior year. Products and Systems Integrations segment backlog was up 2% or $93 million driven by continued strong demand in North America. Software and Services segment backlog was down 2% or $181 million, driven by the reduction related to the Airwave price control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN, partially offset by growth in multi-year software and services contracts in both North America and International and $113 million of favorable foreign currency rates.', 'NOTABLE WINS & ACHIEVEMENTS IN Q4', 'Software and Services', '$330M+ LMR managed services renewal through 2034 for Denmark’s nationwide public safety communications network', '$48M command center order for the City of Chicago Office of Public Safety Administration', '$20M LMR service agreement for Spokane Regional Emergency Communications, WA', '$19M mobile video order for a U.S. customer', '$10M command center order for the City and County of San Francisco, CA', 'Products and Systems Integration', '$90M P25 system and devices order for a U.S. customer', '$67M P25 device order for Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA) in Australia', '$57M P25 APX NEXT devices order for U.S. customer', '$38M P25 system order for the State of Arizona Department of Public Safety', '$31M TETRA system order for a European customer', '$13M fixed video order for an International customer', 'BUSINESS OUTLOOK', 'First-quarter 2024 - The company expects revenue growth of approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of 2023.

As the company's appeal to the CAT has been dismissed, revenue will continue to be recognized according to the remedies order published by the CMA, unless the United Kingdom Court of Appeal were to reverse the remedies order. The company's backlog for Airwave services contracted with the United Kingdom Home Office through 2026, inclusive of the five month period beginning August 1, 2023, was reduced by $777 million to align with the remedies order as of December 31, 2023."", 'MACROECONOMIC EVENTS', 'During fiscal year 2023, the company operated under market conditions influenced by events such as those discussed below.

The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period-to-period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to that of its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of its businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes these measurements enable it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of its core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, GAAP measurements.', 'Reconciliations: Details and reconciliations of such non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this news release.', ""Free cash flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing its performance and coverage ratios with other companies in the company's industries, although the company's measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure is also used as a component of incentive compensation."", 'Organic Revenue: Organic revenue reflects net sales calculated under GAAP excluding net sales from acquired business owned for less than four full quarters.

(collectively, ""Hytera""), alleging trade secret theft and copyright infringement and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the company announced that a jury decided in the company\'s favor in its trade secret theft and copyright infringement case. In connection with this verdict, the jury awarded the company $345.8 million in compensatory damages and $418.8 million in punitive damages, for a total of $764.6 million. In a series of post-trial rulings in 2021, the Court subsequently reduced the judgment to $543.7 million, but also ordered Hytera to pay the company $51.1 million in pre-judgment interest and $2.6 million in costs, as well as $34.2 million in attorneys\' fees. The company continues to seek collection of the judgment through the ongoing legal process.', ""On December 17, 2020, the Court held that Hytera must pay the company a forward-looking reasonable royalty on products that use the company’s stolen trade secrets, and on December 15, 2021, set royalty rates for Hytera's sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 forward. On July 5, 2022, the Court ordered that Hytera pay into a third-party escrow on July 31, 2022, the royalties owed to the company based on the sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2022. Hytera failed to make the required royalty payment on July 31, 2022. On August 1, 2022, Hytera filed a motion to modify or stay the Court’s previous July 5, 2022 royalty order, which the Court denied on July 11, 2023. On August 3, 2022, the company filed a motion seeking to hold Hytera in civil contempt for violating the royalty order by not making the required royalty payment on July 31,2022. On August 26, 2023, the Court granted the company's contempt motion. As a result, on September 1, 2023, Hytera made a payment of $56 million into the third-party escrow. In addition to the September 1, 2023 payment of $56 million, Hytera has made de minimis quarterly royalty payments into the third-party escrow from October 2022 through January 2024. The aggregate amount paid into escrow will not be recognized until all contingencies are resolved and such amount is released from escrow."", 'Following the February 14, 2020 verdict and judgment in the company\'s favor, Hytera subsequently filed several notices of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the ""Court of Appeals""), including a notice of appeal filed on August 2, 2022 which appealed the orders related to the jury\'s verdict as well as the Court\'s royalty order. The company filed its cross-appeal on August 5, 2022. The Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on the parties\' appeals on December 5, 2023.', 'Separate from the company\'s litigation with Hytera, on May 27, 2020, Hytera America, Inc. and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. each filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the ""Bankruptcy Court""). On February 11, 2022, the Court entered an order to confirm the liquidation plan for the two Hytera entities and the distributions were made on February 25, 2022 to the creditors, including a distribution of $13 million to the company. On December 22, 2022, an additional distribution of $2 million was made to the company as well as an assignment of various delinquent accounts receivable of the bankrupt Hytera entities. The gains for the two monetary distributions were recorded to Other charges (income) in the company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.', 'Management typically considers legal expenses associated with defending the company\'s intellectual property as ""normal and recurring"" and accordingly, Hytera-related legal expenses were included in both the company\'s GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The company anticipates further expenses associated with Hytera-related litigation; however, as of 2020, the company believes that these expenses are no longer a part of the ""normal and recurring"" legal expenses incurred to operate its business. In addition, as any contingent or actual gains associated with the Hytera litigation are recognized, they will be similarly excluded from the company\'s non-GAAP operating income, consistent with the company\'s treatment of the approximately $15 million of proceeds realized in 2022. The company believes after the jury award, the presentation of excluding both Hytera-related legal expenses and gains related to awards better aligns with how management evaluates the company\'s ongoing underlying business performance.', 'Share-based compensation expenses: The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.', 'Intangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements, primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well.

This increase predominantly stems from roles that offer remote work arrangements, with specific hubs emerging as prime locations for such arrangements. Among these, San Francisco stands out, followed by New York, Chicago, and Austin. These cities not only have highly competitive job markets but also offer major opportunities for remote employment, reflecting the global shift towards flexible work models. To read more about these cities, see the 30 Best Places to Live While Working Remotely.', 'Moreover, the report highlights key sectors where American talent is in high demand, including research, sales, software engineering, content creation, and product development. This demand underscores the value that international companies place on American expertise, especially in tech-driven fields. As businesses worldwide grapple with talent shortages, the embrace of remote work opens doors for professionals seeking opportunities beyond borders, shaping a landscape where geographical boundaries matter less in the pursuit of talent acquisition and collaboration. To read more about labor shortages, read our article on countries with the highest labor shortages in the world.  It is also interesting to note that according to a survey conducted by Preply among 3,000 Gen Z Americans aged 18 to 26 expressed a desire to move abroad, with an average response of 3.1 out of 5 indicating a preference for living outside the US. Among the top reasons cited for this desire were the availability of social programs (25.6%), the opportunity for new cultural experiences (18.9%), and dissatisfaction with the political climate (17.7%).\xa0', 'Additionally, concerns over issues such as gun violence played a major role, with 59% indicating it influenced their desire to emigrate.

With 90% of Indian business leaders recognizing the necessity for AI skills in new hires, but only 22% of workers currently possessing such capabilities, the initiative addresses a critical gap. The program is designed to reach different segments of society, including 500,000 students in rural areas, 100,000 young women in smaller cities, and 400,000 students in remote tribal areas. Additionally, it aims to equip 250,000 government officers and convene a summit for 2,500 nonprofits. Through these efforts, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) seeks to democratize access to AI skills and empower India's workforce for the future."", ""Moreover, G42 and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) have announced plans to establish a sovereign cloud in the UAE, alongside expanding Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s data center infrastructure in the country.

Additionally, a high number of American military personnel, civilian workers, and dependents reside in Japan owing to the US–Japan Security Treaty, with about 70% stationed in Okinawa Prefecture.\xa0"", 'IM Score: 13', 'Hong Kong is increasingly attractive to Chinese Americans seeking employment due to its growing entertainment industry and historical precedent set by figures like Bruce Lee, Daniel Wu, and Coco Lee.

Hong Kong is one of the places\xa0that gives jobs to foreigners easily.', 'IM Score: 15', ""Taiwan has a growing demand for English teachers and professionals in different sectors such as technology and finance.

For example, Garvey Daniels, who first fell in love with New Zealand in 1996, returned with his family in 2022 for a trial period, deciding to stay longer due to the calm atmosphere. Others, like Jon Kroll, left behind the tensions of Los Angeles for the peaceful vibe of Wellington, enjoying the natural beauty and friendly community.\xa0', 'IM Score: 19', ""Greece has emerged as the most popular country for wealthy Americans looking for European residency, as Portugal ended its golden visa program. Astons reports a 740% increase in US applications in 2021, attributing the shift to Portugal's housing crisis and political uncertainties. Golden visas allow residency for investment, with Greece's costing €250,000 ($269,194), set to double in May. It is one of the countries where it is easy to get work visa in Europe."", 'IM Score: 21', 'While Portugal has consistently enjoyed the status of being a top country for American workers, the allure for Americans seeking affordability is diminishing with the end of its non-habitual resident tax regime in 2024. Once offering a flat tax rate of 20% for foreigners, the shift means newcomers will now face the same tax burdens as locals, potentially doubling or more their tax liabilities. This change impacts over 10,000 Americans residing in Portugal and is likely to deter future migration, especially as housing costs increased 157% in 2021 alone.\xa0', 'Portugal is the best country with a work permit.\xa0', 'IM Score: 22', ""To secure a job in Korea as an American, one must focus on understanding their strengths and limitations, particularly in language proficiency.

Moreover, cultural similarities and a growing expatriate community have facilitated networking and job opportunities.', 'IM Score: 24', 'Americans may find it relatively easier to secure jobs in the UK due to shared language and cultural similarities.

The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues continues to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Exxon Mobil have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-7.5% vs. -3.5%). The company is lagging its peers when it comes to shareholders’ returns. The energy giant’s financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, high input cost is hurting refining operations.Nevertheless, ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. In Stabroek Block, located offshore Guyana, ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook.The advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. ExxonMobil’s deal to acquire Pioneer Natural will bolster its presence in the prolific Permian Basin.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)Toyota Motor’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+56.5% vs. +38.2%).

It plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) for a lineup of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. For fiscal 2024, Toyota projects vehicle sales of 9.6 million units, indicating an increase from 8.82 million units sold in fiscal 2023. Its investor-friendly moves also spark optimism.However, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on the company’s margins.

The main factor weighing on the pharmacy giant was its decision to slash its dividend. That ended a streak of dividend increases that lasted nearly half a century. ', 'Walgreens started 2024 off on a sour note. The pharmacy giant slashed its quarterly dividend by 48%. The company made the move to strengthen its balance sheet and cash position. That will allow the company to reinvest the retained cash into its growth initiatives, which it expects will grow shareholder value. The cut ended an era of dividend growth that had lasted nearly 50 years. ', ""Walgreens had to cut its dividend due to challenges facing its pharmacy business, which made it more difficult for the company to fund its strategy to build a U.S. healthcare business. Those challenges were evident in the company's first-quarter financial results, which it reported in early January. While Walgreens sales rose 8.7% to $36.7 billion, its earnings tumbled more than 40% to $571 million, or $0.66 per share. Meanwhile, the company was burning through cash to build its U.S. healthcare business. Its operating cash flow was negative $281 million during the first quarter, while free cash flow was negative $788 million. "", ""Walgreens is taking several steps to reinvigorate earnings growth and improve its cash flow. It's on pace to achieve $1 billion in cost savings, $600 million in reduced capital spending, and $500 in working capital improvements. Those cost reductions and a lower dividend will increase the company's cash flow, giving it more to invest in growing its U.S. healthcare business and strengthening its balance sheet. "", 'The company has also been working to sell noncore assets to further enhance its financial profile. In early February, Walgreens announced that it had sold another $992 million of Cencora shares. That reduced its ownership stake from 15% to 13%. The company expects to use the proceeds to repay debt and to help fund its growth. Walgreens is also considering an initial public offering of its UK Boots pharmacy business to bring in additional cash. ', 'Walgreens is working to turn around its operations and reaccelerate growth. Unfortunately, its struggles cost the company its rich heritage of increasing its dividend. However, it believes that cutting its payout will allow it to get back on track quicker by enabling it to retain more cash to enhance its balance sheet and fund its growth initiatives. ', ""That turnaround potential makes Walgreens look like a compelling opportunity. Its shares have lost over half their value over the past three years. That's why it still offers an attractive dividend yield (4.4%) even after its reduction. Walgreens could deliver strong total returns if it can turn things around and reaccelerate its growth rate.

We have also discussed the latest unionization events. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 States That Have America's Strongest Unions.\xa0"", 'Dating back to the 19th century, unions have fought for benefits like healthcare and retirement plans. They negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employers to secure better pay and benefits for their members. However, union membership has seen a decline since the mid-20th century, attributed to factors like globalization and anti-union legislation. It is worth mentioning that Union membership in the United States reached its highest point in 1954, with nearly 35% of workers belonging to a union. The total number of union members peaked in 1979, reaching an estimated 21.0 million.\xa0', 'Today, the four largest unions in the United States are the National Education Association (NEA), established in 1857 with approximately 3 million members, representing public school employees such as teachers, support staff, and counselors. NEA is also considered the most powerful union in America. Following NEA is the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), founded in 1921, with approximately 1.9 million members, including healthcare professionals, janitors, and public service workers. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), established in 1932, claims around 1.5 million members, comprising employees of various government levels. Lastly, the Teamsters, with 1.4 million members, represent truck drivers, warehouse workers, and different trades.', 'The three least unionized states in the United States are South Carolina, North Carolina, and Dakota whereas the most unionized states are Hawaii and New York. According to Ziprecruiter, Washington leads for offering the highest union wages by state.', 'In recent years, coffee shops have become hotspots for labor organizing, with hundreds of workers across various locations fighting for unionization. However, the path from signing union cards to securing a contract can be fraught with challenges. The playbook used by companies, both large and small, often involves tactics from specialized law firms in union busting, leading to a protracted process.', 'Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), a prominent example, has seen unions certified at 375 locations, covering around 9,000 employees. Despite this, none have successfully negotiated a contract in over two years. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has docketed 725 charges against Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), with allegations ranging from unfair labor practices to store closures aimed at suppressing union efforts.', 'The struggle at Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has inspired workers beyond the coffee industry to consider unionizing, reflecting a broader trend of unions becoming trendy and appealing to a younger generation. The challenges faced by union baristas, including store closures and firings, highlight the risks involved in organizing at coffee shops, where owners may resort to drastic measures to thwart unionization efforts.', 'Speaking of Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), it is one of the most popular fast food restaurants in America.\xa0', 'Recently, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union have reached a tentative agreement. The development effectively ends the coordinated strikes against the Detroit Three automakers, including Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and Stellantis NV. The agreement includes a record wage and benefit hikes which confirm major victories for auto laborers after years of stagnant wages and concessions made by the union post-2008 financial crisis.', 'Another example to highlight the strength of unions is how currently, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Bessemer fulfilment center is facing the possibility of a third union election, with a crucial hearing scheduled for April 22. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will assess objections raised by Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union (RWDSU) regarding the 2022 union election, determining if any unfair labor practices occurred. This dispute has persisted for three years and there was also a previous union vote in 2021 that was set aside by the NLRB due to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) interference. In the second election on March 31, 2022, initial results showed 875 votes in favor of RWDSU representation, 993 against, and 416 challenged ballots, with 311 challenges remaining. Both the union and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) filed objections, and the upcoming hearing will address 14 objections from the union and seven from Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).', 'a katz / Shutterstock.com', 'To list the states that have America’s strongest unions, we have relied on the percentage of employed wage and salary workers who are either members of labor unions or represented by labor unions, relative to the total employed workforce in each state for the year 2023.

Nationally, the unionization rate was 10% in 2023, down from 10.1% in 2022 and a peak of 20.1% in 1983.

I'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek."", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. PMI delivered another strong operating performance in 2023. We achieved our third consecutive year of positive volumes and a high single-digit organic top line growth driven by smoke-free products. Smoke-free products delivered accelerated accretion to profitability in the fourth quarter, as our IQOS business delivered meaningful 2023 operating leverage, mitigating a significant drag from combustibles. I am also very pleased to report the continued outstanding growth of ZYN, which was not included in organic metrics until mid of November last year. Importantly, smoke-free products reached nearly 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter and over 40% of gross profit. For the year, smoke-free gross profit increased by 19% organically, and we expect smoke-free organic growth to accelerate for both net revenues and gross profit in 2024. ZYN delivered exceptional growth in its first year within PMI, with U.S. pro forma volumes up by over 60% for the year and over 75% in the quarter four. Oral smoke-free is accretive to both our smoke-free business and the overall growth with Swedish Match contributing 50 basis points organic uplift to Q4 OI margins from only 50 days of the period. Our IQOS business continues to deliver excellent results, with 15% adjusted in-market sales growth for heated tobacco units, reflecting broad-based momentum in Europe, Japan and emerging markets. The rollout of IQOS ILUMA is substantially complete and now is present in the 51 markets representing over 95% of IQOS geographies by volume excluding Russia and Ukraine. The superior experience and design of ILUMA, combined with the strong premium brand rate equity of IQOS and our commercial infrastructure enabled IQOS to outgrow the heat-not-burn category, despite holding a category share of over 75%. Importantly, as we have seen in Japan, the launch of ILUMA is a multiyear growth driver consistent with past IQOS innovations. Our 2023 combustible performance was margin-dilutive despite strong commercial results, with very good pricing and higher category share. This reflects the significant cost pressures in the category, geographic mix from volume growth in lower-margin markets without smoke-free product and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This was also compounded by the technical impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine.While constant currency headwinds impacted our revenues in 2023, the strengthening growth and margin profile of smoke-free products set us up well to deliver sustainable growth and returns, including currency in 2024 and beyond. We reached a number of key transformation milestones in the last quarter of last year. First, IQOS' net revenues surpassed Marlboro to become the #1 international nicotine brand on this measure. This demonstrates the power of innovative smoke-free alternatives to switch adult smokers away from cigarettes and to address the societal issue of combustible tobacco. It is also testament to our organization's ability to build strong and sustainable brand equity. This also applies to ZYN, the fastest-growing U.S. smoke-free brand with another outstanding performance in Q4 marked by an increase in category volume share, retail value share and overall volumes. We're also proud to have reached 25 markets where smoke-free products exceed 50% of our top line for both Q4 and the full year. We aim to reach 60 markets by 2030, driving our ambition to exceed 2/3 of group net revenue. Last, as I already mentioned, over 40% of our total gross profit was generated by smoke-free products, with the adjusted gross margin rate on smoke-free surpassing combustibles for both the quarter and year. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to encourage reduced risk nicotine consumption instead of smoking, which is ultimately more sustainable for society. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work remains. Sustainable growth requires a sustainable business, and we continue to garner increasing recognition for our sustainability performance across the key product and operational topics for our company. PMI was included in our Dow Jones Sustainably World Index for the first time, and for the fourth year in a row, the DJSI of America. In addition, PMI was awarded carbon disposal projects Triple A rating for the fourth consecutive year. I will now hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail."", 'Emmanuel Babeau', ""Thank you, Jacek. Let's start with the headline numbers. We finished the year strongly with Q4 organic net revenue growth of plus 8.3%. This includes plus 14% growth from smoke-free products despite slower HTU shipment growth due to comparison effects and also plus 5% growth from combustibles. Pricing was a strong driver for both categories, with smoke-free pricing including the impact of retail price increases on HTUs. While Swedish Match was only included in organic metrics as of November 12, it contributed plus 0.8 percentage points to Q4 organic top line growth and grew by an excellent plus 26% on a pro forma basis. Operating income grew organically by a very good plus 8%, including a Swedish Match contribution of plus 2.2 points. As expected, Q4 margins were broadly stable organically and grew, excluding the technical effect mentioned by Jacek.This enabled our business to deliver another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth at plus 12.2%. This exceeded our prior expectations, with ZYN's remarkable growth as a notable contributor. Despite this strong currency-neutral result, Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.36 was adversely affected by a greater-than-expected currency impact of $0.20. This includes a $0.09 balance sheet-related impact under hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, following the devaluation of the peso in mid-December. As with the previously mentioned impact in Q3, this reflects the depreciation of monetary net assets denominated in pesos, which are subject to capital controls. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods. Turning to the full year. Net revenue grew by plus 7.8% organically, representing the third straight year of high single-digit growth. Similar to Q4, this reflects continued excellent IQOS momentum and strong combustible pricing. In 2023, Swedish Match, led by ZYN, grew pro forma ex currency net revenues by plus 20%. Operating income grew by plus 3.7% organically, reflecting a challenging first half followed by strong growth in H2. We delivered expansion in both adjusted gross margin and operating income margin in H2, driven by the strong progress of smoke-free products. With the impact of accelerated device sales from the ILUMA rollout in the base and a return to sea freight to Japan, the effect of growing HTU volume and ongoing cost optimization are clearly visible. As expected, OI margin organically contracted 150 basis points for the full year, primarily due to acute cost and supply chain headwinds in H1. As flagged in prior quarters, full year margin includes a 40 basis point headwind from the accounting treatment of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine, primarily reflecting the Indonesia excise tax gross-up of around $250 million growth in both net revenue and cost of sales. While headwinds in combustibles have not fully abated, our smoke-free business is delivering excellent profit growth and our organic results will include the strong contribution from Swedish Match going forward. We successfully mitigated inflationary pressure and supported investment with efficiency. Across our total operating cost base, we delivered an incremental $100 million in gross cost efficiency in Q4 and $2.2 billion for 2021-2023 overall, surpassing our $2 billion target. We target an additional $2 billion over the next 3 years. These positive factors allowed us to deliver very strong currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 11%, ahead of our prior expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 includes unfavorable currency of $0.63, primarily reflecting the Japanese yen, Russian ruble and specific Argentine peso dynamic I just explained. We include a slide in the appendix to this presentation with more detail. Focusing now on volumes. We comfortably achieved a third consecutive year of shipment growth driven by a plus 15% increase for IQOS HTUs in addition to a resilient combustible performance. Our smoke-free volumes made up over 20% of total PMI in Q4, and with continued mid-teens of better growth expected here, we are very well positioned to continue growing volumes over the mid and long term. 2023 HTU shipment volume of 125.3 billion units were at the lower end of our targeted range due to delayed launches in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, combined with lower-than-expected underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine. For IQOS HTUs, we believe the best indicator of underlying growth is adjusted IMS as the closest metric to consumer offtake. For the full year, adjusted in-market sales volume and shipment growth were in line at plus 15%. In the fourth quarter, HTU shipment growth of plus 6% reflects trade inventory buildup in the prior year quarter and the plus 14% adjusted IMS growth is, therefore, a more reliable measure of continued strong growth momentum. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, adjusted in-market sales grew by more than plus 17% for the year. For context, across the 2 years before the war began in 2022, these markets made up 23% of HTU shipment volume and exceeded the company's growth rate by a notable margin. These smoke-free volume growth rates exclude the excellent development of our oral nicotine portfolio, driven by ZYN, with shipment volumes up by plus 23% in Q4 and plus 17% in 2023 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 1.4% in 2023, outperforming the international category decline of 2.4%. Turning to profits. Organic operating income growth stepped up in H2 to plus 10% following the exceptional headwinds of H1. We believe this is more representative of the underlying momentum of our business and in line with our '24-'26 CAGR target range of plus 8% to plus 10%. Focusing now on some key drivers of our full year operating income. Smoke-free gross profit grew organically by an excellent plus 19%, expanding gross margin by 340 basis points. This reflects part of the operating leverage of IQOS I already mentioned, with a notable contribution from Swedish Match overall oral nicotine in the last 50 days of Q4 with organic operating profit growth of over 50%. With smoke-free commercial costs also increasing by less than net revenue, this clearly bodes well for 2024 as we continue to benefit from scale effects and manufacturing optimization. Despite very strong pricing, there was only marginal organic growth in combustible gross profit. This partly reflects the negative geographic mix I already mentioned, with greater volume decline in higher-margin markets like Japan as adult smokers switch to smoke-free product, and better volume trends in lower-margin geographies where smoke-free products are small or not available, such as T rkiye. There were also significant inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials and other manufacturing costs. Cost increases on leaf, where inventory cover multiple crop years, and wages are likely to carry over into 2024 and should ease thereafter. Moving now to Swedish Match, which delivered outstanding performance in its first full year as part of PMI with adjusted pro forma currency-neutral top line growth of plus 26% in Q4 and plus 20% in 2023. When we announced our offer for Swedish Match in 2022, we targeted a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital within 5 years. With the growth of ZYN surpassing our expectations, we now expect to achieve this well ahead of time. ZYN delivered another remarkable U.S. performance with plus 78% volume growth in Q4 and plus 62% in 2023. Internationally, we have launched or relaunched ZYN in 10 markets as planned as we continue to focus on building a truly global brand. U.S. cigars posted robust 2023 results, growing net revenues and profit. This was driven by strong pricing following an increase in April, partially offset by volume decline, which reflect lagged competitor pricing and comparison effects. ZYN's excellent U.S. progress continued in Q4 with plus 15% sequential growth in 12-months rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the third consecutive quarter to 72.8%, an increase of plus 5.4 points year-on-year and plus 2 points sequentially. Retail value share also grew during the quarter to 77.4%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step-up in nationwide store velocity and gradual distribution expansion as the category gained strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth. We estimate there were 28.6 million IQOS users as of December 31, representing growth of 1.2 million users in the quarter and plus 3.7 million for the full year, a nice acceleration compared to 2022. This includes notable progress in Japan and Europe in addition to a broad range of other geographies. ILUMA is now available in essentially all major markets outside Russia and Ukraine, with over 70 million estimated adult users as of December 31, 2023. This reflects the switching of existing IQOS user and the acquisition of adult smokers. We expect ILUMA to drive continued strong IQOS user growth in 2024 and beyond. Considering the seasonal fluctuation and volatility in quarterly user estimation, we plan to report this metric on a semiannual basis going forward. With the addition of ZYN to portfolio and the smaller but growing VEEV e-vapor business, we also intend to provide a more holistic view of our total smoke-free user base to investors. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where smoke-free products made up more than 45% of Q4 net revenues. Our Q4 adjusted HTU share increased by plus 1.2 points to 9.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. A key driver is the growing uptake of ILUMA, which is available to around 90% of IQOS users in the region after 8 further launches during the quarter. In the EU, 11 markets, making up nearly 30% of regional IQOS volumes, adopted the Delegated Directive to implement a characterizing flavor ban on heated tobacco product and implemented clean-shelf policies in October. While still early days, we estimate only a small impact on offtake as consumers adjust, as well as on trade inventory levels. Indeed, adjusted IMS volume continue to exhibit very good sequential growth and reached a record high 12.4 billion unit on a 4-quarter moving average. This reflects double-digit year-on-year progression of plus 13% in Q4 despite the lack of growth in Ukraine. We expect the remaining EU markets to adopt the characterizing flavor ban in 2024 and estimate a full year consumer adjustment impact of around 2 billion units on both shipment and IMS, representing less than 5% of regional volume and less than 2% of total PMI. This is consistent with other past flavor restrictions such as the EU ban applied to combustibles in 2020. Based on the initial data from market that have enacted the ban, our fundamental view remains the same. We do not expect a meaningful change in the structural trajectory of the category and indeed, expect Europe adjusted IMS progression to be broadly in line with the group growth rate in 2024. Europe is also an important geography for innovation. LEVIA zero-tobacco HTUs were launched in the Czech Republic in mid-October through limited channels with an encouraging initial response. We plan a broader Czech rollout later this month and further market launches this year. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 40% of the total industry, with IQOS driving its growth and reaching over 8.5 million adult users. In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.1 points to 27.6%, with offtake shares surpassing 34% in Tokyo. Adjusted IMS volume increased by plus 14.5% year-over-year for 2023 and plus 13.4% in Q4 alone, reaching a record high of almost 10 billion units on a 4-quarter moving average. Such impressive growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable potential of IQOS around the world. HTU shipment volume returned to a more normalized state in the fourth quarter as compared to a tough prior year inventory comparison following the substantial completion of the transition back to sea freight in Q3.In addition to strong IQOS share gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q4 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. Egypt continues to impress with Cairo offtake share up plus 3 points to 9.4%, also noting encouraging results elsewhere in the region, such as Morocco and Lebanon. Indonesia also saw notable progress in its capital city, especially given limited commercialization. We continue to see dynamic offtake volume growth across these important future markets, with the city shares towards the right of this chart, an indication of the exciting potential. While we have already covered the margin dynamic on combustibles, our 2023 commercial performance was very robust with organic top line growth of plus 5.5%. This reflects both strong pricing with notable contribution from Germany and Indonesia, and positive share performance within a resilient international category. Our cigarette category share grew by plus 0.1 points in Q4 and plus 0.2 in 2023, with notable contribution from Egypt, Poland and T rkiye. Although flattered by competitor supply constraint in Egypt, which may normalize in '24, we again achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share excluding this effect, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This remains key as our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products. This combustible share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS, led to an increase of plus 0.6 points of international cigarette and HTU share for the full year. As mentioned previously, our superior share of smoke-free products gives us a formidable platform for sustainable share gains with superior unit economics. Before we turn to the 2024 outlook, let me briefly reflect on our strong delivery over the past 3 years in spite of a number of substantial headwinds. The performance was clearly positive compared to our currency-neutral 2021-2023 target of more than 5% organic top line and more than 9% bottom line growth supported by overall growing volumes. For the next 3 years, we target a similar strong volume delivery, a plus 6% to plus 8% organic net revenue CAGR and a step-up in organic operating income growth to plus 8% to plus 10%. We target an adjusted EPS CAGR of plus 9% to plus 11% ex currency growth at constant 2023 corporate tax rate, including an increase in net financing costs, which skews towards the first year of the period in 2024. Okay. This brings me to the outlook for 2024, where we expect a strong acceleration in smoke-free performance across IQOS volume, smoke-free net revenue and gross profit. We forecast the highest-ever absolute increase in HTU adjusted IMS volumes to deliver plus 14% to plus 16% growth in percentage terms despite the inclusion of an estimated impact of around 2 billion units from consumer adjustment to the EU characterizing flavor ban I mentioned earlier and essentially no offtake growth in Russia. For shipment volume, we target more than 140 billion units, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing, new market launches and potential supply chain disruption, such as the ongoing situation in the Red Sea. While shipment growth rates naturally follow adjusted IMS over time, there is a possibility of some lower inventory level compared to 2023 given the substantial completion of ILUMA launches and opportunities for working capital optimization. We expect continued excellent U.S. ZYN volume growth to around 520 million cans. We have also accelerated our capacity expansion plan to support this further significant step up in volume and to manage inventory levels, which are naturally affected by the recent level of growth. Such a strong outlook for IQOS and ZYN means we expect to deliver an acceleration in organic smoke-free top line growth compared to 2023, reaching close to $15 billion in net revenue at prevailing exchange rates. This supports a total PMI forecast of plus 6.5% to plus 8% organic net revenue progression, including a fourth consecutive year of total volume growth and mid-single-digit combustible pricing. We also forecast an acceleration in smoke-free gross profit growth from the organic plus 19% delivered in 2023 as IQOS profitability expands and ZYN's excellent economics continue. We expect smoke-free to again drive the lion's share of our forecast organic OI growth of plus 8% to plus 9.5%, notably given the enduring cost pressure and negative geographic mix in combustible I just mentioned. This naturally implies organic margin expansion, even factoring in the ongoing technical dilution impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia. We expect a meaningful organic improvement in overall gross margin, excluding technical impact, and a very limited currency impact on adjusted OI margin. This forecast includes notable capability investment in the U.S. But as mentioned at Investor Day, we still expect to deliver strong double-digit operating income growth in this market. As flagged at last year in Investor Day, we anticipate an increased net financing expense this year as debt is renewed at higher rates. We forecast a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. We also assume a higher effective corporate tax rate due to Russia suspension of certain double tax treaties and earnings mix. These tax and interest factors combined impact our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth projection by around 2 percentage points. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 9%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.32 to $6.44, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.11 at prevailing rates. This notably includes the net favorable impact of $0.13 related to the revaluation of monetary balances in hyperinflationary economies in 2023, skewed to the second half comparison. Moving to the shape of expected 2024 performance on a quarterly basis. We anticipate good double-digit growth in adjusted IMS HTU growth every quarter, supporting the full year forecast of plus 14% to plus 16%. We forecast a strong Q1 overall with HTU shipment volume of 31 million to 32 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We expect organic top line and operating income growth to be broadly consistent with the full year outlook, which implies organic margin expansion as with the full year. We project strong Q1 currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 7% to plus 10%. This translates to a range of $1.37 to $1.42, including a negative currency variance of $0.10 at prevailing rates, with currency comparisons improving in the second half as we lap the Argentina impact of 2023. Our business remains highly cash generative. However, the $9.2 billion in 2023 operating cash flow was lower than expected. This was due to currency effects on net earnings including the Argentine peso devaluation, other year-end currency impact and higher-than-expected working capital needs. In 2024, we target between $10 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rate and subject to working capital requirements. We continue to prioritize investing in innovation and the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. In 2024, we expect capital expenditure of around $1.2 billion, including the ZYN capacity expansion I just mentioned. Deleveraging remains a key priority for us. And as expected, our 2023 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was around 3x given the 2023 purchase of the remaining Swedish Match minorities and the final U.S. IQOS payment to Altria. We target much better progress of 0.3 to 0.5x deleverage in 2024, driven by continued EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation. We continue to target a ratio of around 2x by the end of 2026, driven with buybacks to be considered once confirmed we are on track. Finally, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. I will now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks."", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Thank you, Emmanuel. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for 2024. First is supporting the sustained growth momentum of IQOS through continuous innovation. This includes leveraging the rollout of ILUMA to maximize user growth, while innovating further on both devices and consumables. Second is to continue the strong U.S. growth of ZYN, supported by targeted commercial investment, long-term capacity expansion and organizational infrastructure, which will also support IQOS. Outside the U.S., we intend to continue developing our integrated multi-category offering to adult nicotine users with further launches of ZYN and, where relevant, our VEEV e-vapor portfolio. Of course, 2024 will be a landmark year for IQOS in the U.S. While the ultimate launch of IQOS ILUMA is the main priority, we continue to prepare for the first city tests of the IQOS 3 blade product starting in Q2 this year. These small-scale pilot launches will allow us to experiment with different aspects of commercialization and support our drive for at-scale commercial success once ILUMA is authorized. While we have no update on the expected PMTA time line, the patent settlement agreement announced last week allows for commercialization of both blade and induction products while mitigating risks of patent-related disruptions and enables us to leverage the scale, optimized cost and flexibility of our global supply chain. In combustibles, we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization while taking judicious pricing actions to drive a positive profit contribution. Our capital allocation priorities are crystal clear. We will continue to invest in the growth of smoke-free products and our commitment to the dividend remains steadfast. Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, deleveraging remains our key balance sheet objective. We aim to continue our excellent progress on sustainability initiatives, including those related to product impact such as youth access prevention and post-consumer waste. Finally, and importantly, we remain committed to transforming the tobacco harm reduction landscape by providing superior alternatives to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and advocating for science-based regulations. We will be expanding further on many of these topics at the CAGNY Conference in 2 weeks' time. Let me now conclude today's presentation. Overall, our business delivered a strong 2023 performance in the face of notable cost headwinds driven by structural smoke-free momentum. The continued excellent performance of IQOS and remarkable growth of ZYN strengthened their positions as leading brands with excellent equity. Combined with our unrivaled commercial and innovative capabilities, we have a powerful platform to expedite our smoke-free future as we broaden our portfolio and reach to adult smokers. We expect 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth for smoke-free products and remain confident in our 2024-2026 growth targets. We have exciting opportunities in the U.S. and internationally, which we are fully dedicated to capture as we progress towards our ambition of being sustainably smoke-free by 2030. Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business underpins our ability to deleverage while returning cash to shareholders. Thank you. And Emmanuel and I are now happy to answer your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.', 'Bonnie Lee Herzog', ""Hi, everyone. I actually wanted to ask a high-level question on the year. You originally guided FX-neutral EPS growth in '23 of 7% to 9%. Yet, you really did finish out the year a lot stronger, reporting 11% currency-neutral EPS growth. So as you look back, what were some of the key areas of outperformance versus your initial expectations? And then as you think about this year, you're initially guiding to 7% to 9% FX-neutral EPS growth again. So just trying to understand how conservative this may be, especially considering your 9% to 11% midterm growth target?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""So Bonnie, with regards to 2023, I think the momentum which we have in the category is in Japan, is really well worth singling out. And despite the fact that as you know IQOS occupies a very sizable part of the segment, I mean where we capture well above our segments, I think we captured about 80% of the entire segment growth in Japan. So this is very strong. Japan is on the forefront of a smoke-free transformation. We're approaching the year, 10 (inaudible) of IQOS in Japan. And if I just look over the last few weeks how category is continuously expansions in Japan, I think in the Tokyo area, the smoke-free products now about exceeded the size of the cigarette category. So if IQOS continues after 10 years participating in this phenomenal growth, this is really worth singling out. Clearly, ZYN and as we indicated very much, we've been very keen and very pleased that we could conclude the acquisition of Swedish Match, that adds the important element of our portfolio of alternative smoking, the pouches and obviously, creates a very good opening for us in entering the U.S. market and that ZYN is clearly is growing above their expectations. What is very important is we hear from time to time, quite rightly, conversations about some unintended consequences about the use of the product. I am so pleased with both IQOS and with ZYN actually are delivering of as they were designed for, i.e. going after adult smokers in the U.S. above 21 years. We're all familiar with the CDC data, less than 80% (inaudible), the same is for IQOS and international. So we have a good -- my view is we have a very good, sustainable growing 2 fabulous propositions in a smoke-free product, and we're also trying here to be very focused from a financial perspective with regards to the [e-vape]. So right now, if we [roll] this forward to 2024, I think that Japan is on the good momentum. ZYN in the U.S. continues this momentum. Europe is going very strongly very well. Yes, we have this distortion maybe potential headwinds we're getting there. We very clearly indicated the $2 billion potential impact from the flavor ban in the EU. But other than that, these key geographies and these key geographies also are very important from the margin perspective expansion, they really are on the positive side. And I don't want to sound negative on the rest of the world. However, one thing you should note that, on occasions, there might be some conversations around the growth trajectory of IQOS and so on. And you remember during Investors Day, I've been very clear. We're running IQOS 10 consecutive years of fabulous growth despite the fact that we essentially lost any growth, access to any growth in Russia and Ukraine. And historically, I mean, Russia alone was delivering, and depends how you now -- which period you pick up, but easily above the 4 billion maybe even 5 billion per annum growth of the category. So I think we need to look at this trajectory from this perspective, which makes me even more confident about our 3-year outlook."", 'Bonnie Lee Herzog', ""Okay. That was helpful. And then I did want to ask a little bit more on margins. Just hoping for a little bit more color on your margins in Q4, especially in Americas, where they were actually negative. I'm assuming, I think you called this out, a key driver of this is your investments ahead of the IQOS relaunch in the U.S. in May. So in the context of this, how should we think about operating income growth in Americas this year? Will it continue to be negative? And then for the full year of '24 year, just total company, your guidance is for FX-neutral revenue growth and operating income growth does imply operating margin expansion. So could you maybe touch on your expectations for gross margin and OpEx in the context of that?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Yes, Bonnie, Emmanuel can chip in a little more details. I think in the Americas segment, where it's more the impact of the devaluation in Argentina which drove the margins down rather than the U.S. market. Specifically about the U.S. market, yes, there is the increased investment also to continue supporting ZYN growth, ZYN expansion, but also in preparing Swedish Match organization or Philip Morris International in the U.S. organization for being able to handle IQOS soon and obviously have the organizations, which is after the opportunities and the challenges of the U.S. market. So there are some investments which are already flowing through the P&L even ahead of the IQOS process start of the commercialization. Emmanuel, do you want to?"", 'Emmanuel Babeau', ""Yes, just to complement -- to answer your question, Bonnie, and complement what Jacek was saying on what is behind the higher-than-expected performance for '23. Clearly, as I described, a very strong dynamic on the volume on the commercial dimension, if you want. But we've been very pleased as well with the development of our margin on our smoke-free product. And we are today seeing the margin both on IQOS and on ZYN being above the average margin on CC. We are making progress on the profitability of the IQOS product and we have some price increase in Q4 overall. So that was the planned dynamic, but it is happening maybe even a bit better than what we're expecting, and we expect that to continue in Q4.And in that perspective, I mean, clearly, the U.S. is a fantastic market. We've described the fact that the margin of ZYN in the U.S. is best-in-class among our portfolio of product. And therefore, make no mistake, even if indeed, we're going to continue to invest in the U.S., the U.S. is going to be super nicely accretive in all parameters of our P&L at the level of the, of course, revenue growth but also at the level of the margin evolution and at the level of the operating income. And we reflect the fact that we talk about double-digit growth and very strong double-digit growth. U.S. is a very powerful contributor to our financial performance."", 'Bonnie Lee Herzog', 'Okay. Emmanuel, if I may just clarify something then. For this year, you are expecting gross margin and possibly op margin expansion? Based on your guidance, it implies op margin.', 'Emmanuel Babeau', 'Yes. We do absolutely, Bonnie. Yes', 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Gaurav Jain with Barclays."", 'Gaurav Jain', ""Two questions from me. One is just to clarify the Argentinian peso impact. So you have a $0.19 impact this year, which is linked to balance sheet revaluation. And on the slide, you are using the Argentinian peso rate, which is equal to the spot rate. So there shouldn't be any further balance sheet revaluation down, which means that there is an automatic $0.19 benefit to EPS. Isn't that the way the math works?"", 'Emmanuel Babeau', ""Look, of course, we cannot speculate on any further devaluation of the peso. The reality is that the amount in dollar terms has been significantly reduced by the last devaluation. So a further devaluation would impact to a much lower amount. Now I don't know whether more devaluation could come. Frankly, we're not able to anticipate this kind of thing. What you have to take into account is that the basis has been -- in fact, [as] basically with the devaluation in December. So any further devaluation would apply to a lower base in Argentinian peso."", 'Gaurav Jain', 'Sure. Maybe I can ask it separately. And my second question is around ZYN. We are hearing a lot of statements. We had a statement by Chuck Schumer. A lot of investors are concerned, they think that regulation is coming on, then flavors will get banned. So how do you plan to get ahead of this entire potential controversy that could emerge around ZYN?', 'Jacek Olczak', ""Yes. So we observed over the last few weeks, I heard a lot of conversations around Brazil in social media and generally Internet and media. I think, look, ZYN is in the U.S. market for 10 years, okay? And if you look at the numbers, CDC latest data on the (inaudible) under ages, et cetera, it stays very below. I think it's [50%] which is the lowest from any product nicotine and also other products where there's some major restrictions applied. I think we know what about the Swedish Match marketing practices, and we were taking this very seriously during the acquisition of the (inaudible). We have said that the alignment with Service Match was not only that they were pursuing the smoke-free trajectory, but also that they have a very responsible and a disciplined approach to the marketing as we are on -- with IQOS, with heat-not-burn and the international. We have reached out to the few people who have been the most vocal too in these conversations with general consumer, but also to FDA and I think the facts are different than sometimes it is being -- trying to be the positions in the media. So the product is helping adult smokers with very strict with the age verifications. Obviously, when it comes to the conversations among the adults in the social media, that's going a little -- well, going anticipating, frankly speaking, in the territories we wouldn't have a control. ZYN is not using any paid ambassadors or whatever this is being called in the social media. So we think what we're doing is put the right product from the potential of the reduction of the harm where the product is based on science position and the risk reduction continuum, frankly speaking, it is the best nicotine alternative to any another nicotine product, very much obviously versus the cigarette. We have a pending PMTA with FDA and feel the science is very strong and very conclusive on the site. So I feel very confident. From the very beginning of our transformation, solid Swedish Match, we put the marketing team and very much the protection of the youth very, very high on our agenda. So I think it gives me the confidence that, as I said earlier to Bonnie's question, we have a progress, phenomenal growth on the products, which are delivered in a very sustainable manner to adult smoker."", 'Operator', ""We'll go now to Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley."", 'Pamela Kaufman', ""I have a question about ZYN as well. It's seen phenomenal growth in the U.S. Can you talk about what's driving the acceleration in growth in ZYN in the U.S.? And are there any particular regions where you're seeing stronger growth? And just on the ZYN guidance, it implies about 35% growth in U.S. shipments, but that seems conservative given the strength that we've seen. So is there anything that would temper ZYN's growth outlook relative to what we're observing?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Yes. So the ZYN, as you might remember from our Investors Day, the profile of the ZYN, when it comes toward the smoke or where the adults are coming from, there is any sourcing very nicely from a combustible cigarette, obviously, serves from the overall categories, including the tobacco-containing pouches, Swedish snus or similar products, but also resourcing from the vape category. So it is being recognized by the growing number of adults, the convenience of usage of Brazil. It is -- another way of looking at ZYN, it is a natural innovation or extension of the Swedish snus product, the tobacco-containing pouches. Obviously, as we know them, some people were not maybe comfortable of having a tobacco in the pouch. There are some optical hygienic type where they may be constraints, et cetera, and ZYN is something which is -- looks cleaner and is white, it doesn't contain tobacco, which might have been for a -- might be for some consumer create some resistance. So this is what I can say. I think the product has a good trajectory. The market is a large market in the U.S. with a well developed e-vape category, obviously, still a very sizable combustible cigarette category and also many other oral tobacco forms, so it's a nice [sourcing] for ZYN, which is appealing to these audiences. With regards to your comments [about the] number of accounts forecasted (inaudible) our guidance for next year. Agreed. We are very well familiar with that (inaudible) trend in the U.S. Can ZYN surprise us to the positive? Yes. Can -- but guidance is built on the number of the assumptions, right? I mean it's a global business, multi-category and there are some headwinds, which we are aware today. I'm not sure whether there's a lot of materialized, but I think it's a matter of prudence is that this part of the year at the beginning of the year to single them amount and be prudent, but there are also some upsides and the tailwinds, which we are well aware of. The year-end [faults] will come to the Q1. I mean as a (inaudible), we build the confidence as you go through the year."", 'Emmanuel Babeau', ""Yes. And Pam, to clarify the guidance here, we are coming with a growth year-on-year that would be similar than the one we've been experiencing in terms of total volume growth and not in a big percentage year versus '23 and '22. So these are similar volume growth. It's related to a reduction in the growth rate. We'll see whether your -- we have still going even higher than what we are forecasting for the time being."", 'Pamela Kaufman', ""Okay. That makes sense. And a question on the patent settlement with BAT. Can you elaborate on the implications of that? I know you've been investing in manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. for IQOS. How does the settlement influence your ability to import into the U.S.? And does it change your manufacturing strategy?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Well, it actually allows us now to also connect IQOS in the U.S. to the supply chain, which is on the international supply chain from day 1, which is operating with all the benefits of economies of scale, et cetera. So obviously, as the mitigating type of a strategy we have been implementing in parallel the alternative manufacturing in the U.S., but that obviously is the first factory, first volumes. We would obviously result in the increased or elevated cost both on the devices and the HeatSticks and it will take a while until U.S., on a stand-alone basis, would close at the same level of the benefits of the cost, if you like, as we had on international. So for us, it clears the path for IQOS. We don't [make any Lomas] so we're bringing a lot of -- or removing that, I should say, uncertainty from today and going forward. And IQOS because it is U.S., it's just another market which we added to the geographical family of IQOS presence from a day 1 or (inaudible) as I said, to the pipeline of the products and its economic cost benefits as an international market. So for us, actually, is clarity and acceleration which we gain through this agreement. And obviously, as we all know, the patent litigation territory has a high degree of uncertainty. And we're running a very sizable business and we plan to have even more sizable business with the addition now of U.S. and that clarity and the visibility going forward is very important which I believe is also important for investors too."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Faham Baig with UBS."", 'Mirza Faham Ali Baig', ""I have a couple as well, please. Firstly, you're guiding for another impressive year of mid-teens heated tobacco in-market sales growth. You've highlighted Europe will be within that range. Historically, Europe has done slightly better. What markets make up the sort of difference to help you to still get to the mid-teens growth? If you could allude to the larger markets. And within that, are you assuming any contribution from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, you mentioned? And what should we expect for the U.S. as well, please?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""So maybe I start with the U.S. I mean the U.S., we will do the test market on IQOS 3 point -- what we called IQOS 3.0 blade product, which is literally for us the high cost and we keep looking forward to get more visibility from FDA with regards to the PMTA MRTPA for IQOS which would allow us to accelerate the broader, more national type of a commercialization. So what we have assumed in 2024 in terms of the volume contribution of IQOS from U.S., it's very minimal. We are not treating this as testing the engine, commercial, the consumer phasing type of a solution rather than a [lower] the current version of the product at the full scope. We have assumed -- we made some assumptions with regards of opening the markets in which IQOS today is not allowed. (inaudible) not on the list is obviously Taiwan. Okay, that's each other assumptions and we might be right or wrong, but these are the assumptions which we made. It obviously hinges on the speed of some regulatory decisions and the laws being passed and et cetera. And with regards to Europe, look, I mean although I believe and the history have shown with the flavor type of regulations in the different categories, in the different places, that over a period of time, they don't have much of an impact to the [dollar]. But we're going in a period that some markets or markets will be implementing these regulations. I think they need to be cautious that there might be some distortions. I mean that they put in a guidelines and these will be transparent and still give you (inaudible) with headwind, which we take in, in the volume outlook for IQOS, but we'll have to see where this materializes. Not materialize, I think it's a matter of [who then]. So we should talk about this. Other than that, the underlying IQOS growth, if I look at the value of a share evolution, essentially, our European market is pretty strong despite the fact that very much in Central Europe, there is maybe more of the pricing competition from other heat-not-burn participants. But we also have a very strong price competition, extremely strong price competition, I should say, both on the devices and the consumables, consumables in Japan. And over the period of time, IQOS navigates for this highly sometimes aggressive competitive pricing environment very well. So that's essentially where we are. Germany grows very nicely. Italy continues with a very strong growth momentum. Again, the major driver is Spain. We make the -- we start making a significant progress. So that's it for me."", 'Mirza Faham Ali Baig', ""And then just one other question, please. So you're expecting a smoke-free acceleration in 2024, but that's not translating into group net revenue growth acceleration in 2024. Are you expecting a softer performance in combustibles in '24? Is that the discrepancy?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Yes. I mean look, this is the blended -- at this moment in time, at the beginning of the year, the blended outlook for the group revenue is combustibles, oral and, obviously, heat-not-burn. There's few other in smaller things. But we have managed last year to deliver a very strong pricing variance. I think again, it's fair to assume that the driver of a pricing variance may not be repeatable this year. But there is obviously a pricing potential, which we baked in, in the -- or included in the guidance. Look, for some of these things, we need a little bit more visibility to start increasing our confidence. I still believe that if I compare what Philip Morris is delivering now, number of the years when we leave the revenue top line above 7%. And remember very well the times when we started transformations when they were the 3% to 5%, now I think a quality what counts for us, and this is what we pay a lot of attention, that we not only want to lead in a sustainable matter the revenue growth, but obviously important is the quality of that revenue growth. So having a 3-year total group volumes to start with above was no decline, not even flat, but growing, when you start overlaying this by pricing and managing to -- focusing to avoid the risk of some down-trading, et cetera, I think that the 7% is there, well, above 7% revenue growth is the pretty -- from a qualitative perspective, not just from the nominal growth perspective, I would think that is all that (inaudible)."", 'Emmanuel Babeau', ""Just to add to what Jacek has just been saying. I mean indeed, it's taking into account that 2023 was exceptional when it comes to price increase with close to 9% on the combustible portfolio and we don't intend to repeat that. We are guiding to a mid-single-digit price increase for 2024. So of course, that will have an impact and make a difference on the growth of our revenue on the combustible business."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Callum Elliott with Bernstein."", 'Callum Elliott', ""I just wanted to start with disposable vaping products. We've obviously seen these products have huge success in the U.S. in 2023 and the U.K. also driving us a steeper volume decline for commutable cigarettes in those markets. Obviously, your combustible cigarette business in those 2 markets is not huge, if nonexistent, obviously, in the U.S. So not a huge impact on your business so far. But my question is why do you think we haven't seen equivalent success for these products in the markets that are big markets for your business and the EU in particular? And do you think this could be a threat to your business in 2024?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""You mean the threat to our business coming from the vape products? Look, there a number of factors, right? So one is that I think that the category of the vape product is being disposable; it's not disposable. It's very much focused in terms of the offering and innovation, frankly speaking, into the flavors, right? Then we very often forget that the core of the smokers' market-by-market with literally few exceptions are very much and if I would characterize is a traditional tobacco type of experience flavor, et cetera. So this creates sort of a more dual consumption or occasional consumption. But I think for some smokers and we know it from our experience of IQOS, it actually triggers curiosity to try, but at the same time, triggers the bottleneck in terms of a full-time type of a switching adoption. So that's one of the factors, okay? And then obviously, other factors at play."", 'Callum Elliott', ""I guess I understand that, yes. But why hasn't that -- it seems like in the U.S. and the U.K., that hasn't been an impediment to these products' success over the past 12, 18 months."", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Results, so the focus, right? Because U.K. was on the forefront as was U.S., if I remember historically, of the forefront of this category partially, I guess, also attracted by the underlying margins in the CC category. So obviously, people are going with alternatives to the places which create some sort of that underlying margin opportunity with the relative freedoms also to talk about these products. As you know, Europe very much, but also in international, some countries, these products are not very -- let me put it that way, warmly welcomed. So let's leave aside the [harming action] principles, but some other opinions and views at play. Look, we know that we enter a category, but we're trying to be very disciplined or focused I should say and it's very easy to enter into this category without too much of the path to sustainable profitability. And we don't want to focus the company from some other opportunities which we're pursuing, which, in our view, are more sustainable and offer the good start for the margins and the underlying profitability. But when we enter with this product, Italy, Czech, a few other markets, I mean our products despite the fact that we're relatively late into the -- from a category history perspective, and then we have gained double-digit shares in this market in the speed of (inaudible) less than 12 months or so. So it also tells you there is a lot of lack of loyalties in place. There's a lot of yes, I know that we see the volumes, but there's a lot of trial. I should not ban category and the pouches judge by performance in the U.S. And then by definition, the consumer is more loyal, more focused, more discipline in how they navigate it also."", 'Callum Elliott', ""Okay. And I have a follow-up that is related but maybe a slightly more philosophical question. In a number of markets and especially the U.S. related to some of these disposable vaping products, we've been seeing this formation of -- I would describe it as like a dual-tiered market that's been forming with big legacy players such as yourselves who are forced to play by the rules and hold themselves to a certain set of standards, marketing only to existing nicotine users and all of us will have seen your video on ZYN last week, I would imagine. But at the same time, we also have a secondary set of smaller new businesses who seem to be doing basically whatever they want and often illegally, but having great success within the marketplace and attracting lots of consumers. And so I guess my question is, do you think that this dual-tiered structure that seems to be forming in a number of markets, structurally impairs the attractiveness of your business and your brands when it seems like you're just being forced to play on a playing field which is not level?"", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Well, look, obviously, companies like ours is not even thinking about doing something which would be against or crossing the line of regulations or even, I would say, societal expectations. So obviously, I mean, our ability to come to you, these are -- it isn't what you're asking, grossly different than some other operators or participants in the market, especially people who don't have a view of 10 years or 15 years outlook, but it's essentially hit and run almost type of operation. And I think we know what has happened or what is happening in the U.S. There is, I understand, some discipline in the market is now underway. But frankly speaking, it's a long overdue because there is a lot of -- pardon my language, but a mess created in the market by the fact that regulators, law enforcements and other design for this designated for these agencies were a bit slow. And I think it's, frankly speaking, a replica, which we have for many years, and still in some places, kind of on a cigarette market, and it forms of an illicit type of a participation in the market. It's not only marketing practices, but also products, product standards, all of these things creates completely around distortions in the market at the expense of the legitimate category manufacturers and also diverts the conversation from how further we can progress and have reductions and divert them into the things which relatively easily should be fixed."", 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from Matt Smith with Stifel.', 'Matthew Edward Smith', ""Wanted to ask a follow-up question about investment levels embedded in the 2024 outlook. If we consider the expectation for gross and operating profit margin expansion on an organic basis, can you talk about the areas where you're seeing a step up meaningfully in incremental investment?Last year, you called out $150 million of explicit investments, including $75 million or so in the U.S. It would seem like the growth in ZYN would allow you to step that investment level up while still being able to achieve your double-digit profit expectations in the market."", 'Jacek Olczak', ""Yes. So a lot depends, obviously, we thought a great (inaudible) adjusted the live above on the revenue growth. So obviously, we are assuming some improvement in the margins. But on the other hand, I think we will have enough of the resources to support that revenue growth. So it is -- if we were to completely stop investing, obviously, the expansions on a wide growth would be much more significant, margin expansions will be much more significant, but we are -- it is not what we see in our strategy. So I think once we operate it at scale and we build, like the consumer has there, so the scale in the U.S., (inaudible) is very substantial over there, at least by the market standard. And the revenue, which we generate from a small (inaudible), also combustibles on international with that sort of a revenue growth rate, I think we have a room to provide for the investments to support today's and tomorrow's growth while also allowing for driving the margin expansion. We also have provided here some inflationary pressure. And I think, especially on the combustible, I -- we assume that the '24 is sort of the last year of this extra ordinary life of inflation under pressure. And as of '25, in other words, we should start seeing easing when the COGS pressures, and this is about delivering some other materials, and I think every incremental IQOS and every incremental ZYN is obviously requires proportionally less of the investment with the first IQOS and the first ZYN.So I mean the scale offer is going forward, there's opportunity for supporting the margin."", 'James R. Bushnell', 'Before closing...', 'Operator', ""That concludes today's question..."", 'James R. Bushnell', ""Sorry. Before closing our call, I'd like to remind you that we will be presenting at the CAGNY conference on February 21, and we hope you'll be able to join either in person virtually.

It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$4.4b and statutory earnings per share of US$1.68 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Western Union is executing in line with expectations. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Western Union ', ""Following the recent earnings report, the consensus from 18 analysts covering Western Union is for revenues of US$4.15b in 2024. This implies a measurable 4.8% decline in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to dip 6.1% to US$1.68 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$4.16b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.67 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$13.18, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Western Union at US$18.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$10.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", 'One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would also point out that the forecast 4.8% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the historical trend, which saw revenues shrink 4.7% annually over the past five years By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 3.8% per year. So while a broad number of companies are forecast to grow, unfortunately Western Union is expected to see its revenue affected worse than other companies in the industry.', ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Western Union analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""And what about risks?

Stein', ""Good morning. Thanks for joining us on the call today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. Then Joel and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter.To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this.About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically; first, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology.Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had a strong quarter. Our Q1 results ran ahead of our expectations, and we have raised our sales and EBITDA as defined guidance for the year. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable as the industry continues to recover and progress towards normalization.Global air traffic is closing in on pre-pandemic levels and demand for travel remains high. Airline demand for new aircraft also remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, total air travel demand remains slightly below pre-COVID levels and OEM aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. There is still progress to be made for the industry, and our results continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels.In our business, during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. Our EBITDA as defined margin was 51% in the quarter contributing to the strong Q1 margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of over $630 million and ended the quarter with over $4.1 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2024.Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we agreed on November 9, to acquire the Electron Device Business of Communications & Power Industries, also known as CPI, for approximately $1.385 billion in cash. CPI's Electron Device Business is a leading global manufacturer of electronic components and subsystems, primarily serving the aerospace and defense market. The products manufactured by this business are highly engineered proprietary components with significant aftermarket content and a strong presence across major aerospace and defense platforms.Our team is working diligently through the approval process in the U.S. and U.K., and the acquisition is expected to close this fiscal year. We remain very excited about adding this proprietary business as one of our TransDigm operating units.Regarding the current M&A pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we continue to see a target-rich environment for our focused acquisition strategy. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio.The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict. As always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic.As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of over $4.1 billion, which includes the $2 billion of cash from the new debt issued during our first quarter. Sarah will comment on this in more detail later. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.Moving to our outlook for fiscal '24. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '24 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. At the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $85 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $45 million. The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for a continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets throughout fiscal year '24.Our current guidance for fiscal '24 is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. Note that the pending acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business is excluded from this guidance until acquisition closed. The midpoint of our fiscal '24 revenue guidance is now $7.665 billion or up approximately 16%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. For Defense, we now expect revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. This is an increase from our previous guidance of mid- to high single-digit percentage range.We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. Commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial OEM revenue growth around 20% and commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range.The midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.985 billion or up approximately 17% with an expected margin of around 52%. This guidance includes about 100 basis points of margin dilution from our recent Calspan acquisition. We anticipate EBITDA margins will move up throughout the remainder of the year. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is decreasing versus our prior guide primarily due to the higher interest expense associated with the incremental debt we took on to fund CPI. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is now expected to be $30.85 or up approximately 19% over prior year. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS along with some other fiscal '24 financial assumptions and updates.We believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal '24. We'll likely continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly.Let me conclude by stating that I am very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence.Now let me hand it over to Joel Reiss, our TransDigm Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items."", 'Joel Reiss', ""Good morning. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2023, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 25% in Q1 compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. Our strong bookings continue to support the commercial OEM guidance of revenue growth around 20% for fiscal '24. OEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but appear to be progressing. We continue to be encouraged by the steadily increasing commercial OEM production rates and strong airline demand for new aircraft. Supply chains remain the primary bottleneck in this OEM production ramp-up.The FAA's recently announced production rate freeze at 38 per month for the Boeing 737 MAX will likely slow the expected MAX ramp and time will tell how this plays out. The commercial OEM guidance given today takes into account an appropriate level of continued risk around Boeing's production build rate. While risks such as this and others remain towards achieving the ramp-up across the broader aerospace sector, we are optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production targets as they occur.Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 22% compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is by far our largest submarket. We also saw good growth in our interior submarket compared to prior year Q1 and biz jet was up slightly year-over-year as well. These increases were very minimally offset by a very slight decline in our freight submarket driven by the return of belly capacity and consistent with what we discussed on last quarter's earnings call.Commercial aftermarket bookings for this quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. The strong booking levels in commercial aftermarket continue to support our commercial aftermarket guide for revenue growth in the mid-teens percent range for fiscal '24. As a reminder, when forecasting our commercial aftermarket, we always look at a rolling historical 12-month average booking trend, never just the most recent quarter, due to lumpiness that we often see in this end market.Turning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for December. Global revenue passenger miles still remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, but only slightly. December 2023 air traffic was about 2.5% below pre-pandemic and full 2023 traffic was about 6% below. Globally, a return to 2019 air traffic levels is expected in 2024 and IATA currently expects traffic to reach 104% of 2019 levels in 2024. Domestic travel continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. In the most recently reported traffic data for December, global domestic air traffic was up 2% compared to pre-pandemic. Domestic air travel in China also continues to improve and was up 8% in December compared to pre-pandemic levels. This is a significant improvement from China being down 55% a year ago in December 2022.Shifting over to the U.S., domestic air travel for December came in about flat with pre-pandemic traffic. International traffic has continued to make steady improvement over the past few months. A quarter ago, at the end of September, international travel globally was depressed about 7% compared to pre-pandemic levels, but in the most recently reported data for December, international travel was only down about 5%. This is a significant improvement over being down 25% a year ago in December 2022.In summary, for the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see strong growth in our passenger and interior submarkets, indicative of the continuing positive trends in the post-COVID passenger traffic recovery. Our biz jet and freight submarkets are performing in line with their underlying markets and also in line with our expectations at this point in the year.Shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 28% compared with the prior year period. Q1 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses. However, bear in mind that the comparable prior year period was an easy comp. We would not expect to see defense revenue growth rates at this level continuing throughout the balance of the year. We expect some moderation here as you can tell from the guidance.Defense bookings are also up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period. While the defense revenue growth this quarter was pretty broadly distributed across our customer base, we continue to see improvements in the U.S. government defense spending outlays during Q1. We are hopeful we will continue to see steady improvement. But as we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. We know the bookings and sales will come, but forecasting them with accuracy and precision is difficult. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we now expect our defense market revenue growth for this year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range.This updated guidance for defense primarily reflects the stronger-than-expected Q1 defense sales as well as the good Q1 bookings. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the fiscal 2024 fiscal year and I was pleased with our operational performance. We will remain focused on our consistent operating strategy and servicing the strong demand for our products as we continue throughout the balance of the year.With that, I would like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne."", 'Sarah Wynne', ""Thanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the first quarter and then provide some more information on the guidance update.First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the first quarter, our organic growth rate was 23.5%, and all market channels contributed to this growth as Kevin and Joel have just discussed. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally define as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, was roughly [$660] million for the quarter. This is a higher than average free cash flow conversion for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of our interest and tax payments. Cash interest and tax payments will pick up again in the next quarter and for the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged. We expect to continue to generate free cash flow of close to $2 billion in fiscal '24.Below that free cash flow line, net working capital consumed a smaller amount of cash than in prior years coming in close to flat. For the past 2 years, we saw a large influx of cash into our working capital as our primary commercial end markets experienced strong rebound post COVID. We were obviously very happy to support this increase. Going forward, we expect our annual dollars invested in net working capital to moderate from the elevated levels seen over the prior 2 years, but pinpointing the exact amount of investments for fiscal '24 is difficult. As you know, the rebound of the OEM market channel does impact our accounts receivable as customers in that bucket typically have slightly longer payment terms.We ended the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5x, down from 5.4x at the end of last quarter when pro forma for the $35 dividend. As a reminder, we are comfortable operating in the 5 to 7 net debt-EBITDA ratio range. And while we are currently sitting on the low end of this range, a go-forward strategy of capital deployment has not changed. Our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.3x on a pro forma basis, which provides us with comfortable cushion versus our target range of 2 to 3x. During the first quarter, we went to the market and proactively raised [$3 billion] of debt for the acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business, which is still subject to regulatory approval with the rest going towards general corporate purposes. As a result of the additional debt, our interest expense estimate for fiscal '24 increased by $130 million, as you can see in today's updated interest expense guidance. Regarding that debt, we expect to continue both proactively and prudently managing our maturity debt stack, which for us means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date. Our near term debt maturity is now 2026, and we remain appropriately 75% hedged on a total $22 billion gross debt balance through our fiscal 2026. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term. With regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we increased our midpoint sales and EBITDA by $85 million and $45 million, respectively, given the strong quarter and current expectations for the year. Our EPS guidance is now $30.85 compared to prior guidance of $31.97. The reduction is due to additional interest expense. Without that, it would be $32.57. As we sit here today from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via dividends or share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.', 'David Egon Strauss', 'Kevin, could you talk about maybe what you saw in terms of the aftermarket growth on a sequential basis Q4 versus Q1? And then it looks -- you have a very tough aftermarket comp in Q2. Any range on how we should calibrate aftermarket growth in Q2?', 'Kevin M. Stein', ""I think we're forecasting mid-teens percentage. It might revise up. We'll have to see how the year unfolds. It was a strong quarter in Q1. The bookings are there. We saw a sequential increase in shipments in Q1, and we anticipate that, that will continue."", 'David Egon Strauss', ""Okay. A quick follow-up. Is there any -- has there been any change in the timing around closing on the CPI deal? I think previously you said by the end of Q3, I think how you're seeing before the year-end, I don't know if there was a meaningful change there at all."", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Yes. We're still incredibly positive on the CPI acquisition. There's zero overlap with anything we do. Right now, it's going through the approval process and yes, we're very positive about it happening. It's just difficult to predict timing. As you know, things are taking a little bit longer, but we anticipate this fiscal year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.', 'Noah Poponak', ""Maybe you could elaborate on how the M&A pipeline looks and ability or opportunities to deploy capital after CPI? Because you mentioned being at the low end of the target balance sheet leverage range and you're basically going to generate the CPI cost over the remaining quarters of the year in free cash. So that's not actually going to raise your leverage. So how are you looking at managing that? And how much more opportunity is there to deploy capital in the near term?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""I think we'll look at deploying capital during the fiscal year, probably closer to the end of the fiscal year as we sort out the M&A pipeline. The M&A pipeline is -- there's a lot going on. There's a lot of targets much like usual, a ton of names that we didn't see coming. And we continue to evaluate. I think the point about TransDigm is we're incredibly disciplined in our M&A. We're not going to acquire something that doesn't match our criteria of highly engineered products in aerospace and -- with access to the aftermarket. I mean that's something we're going to continue to stay disciplined on, and it's extremely encouraging that there's so many targets on the list. Now they -- there's a lot of small and medium-sized targets. Those are the easiest ones for us to exercise."", 'Noah Poponak', 'Okay. In the aerospace aftermarket, has there been any deceleration in the rate of increase in price as broader inflation has decelerated? Or has that rate of change held in despite that decel?', 'Joel Reiss', ""There's really been no change to our overall philosophy and approach. We continue to look to market-based value the product and to offset the inflationary pressures that I would see. Obviously, not all operating units see the same level of inflationary pressures. And that's generally what they're trying to do is to offset that."", 'Noah Poponak', 'Okay. Is there a window of time here though, where the cost side is decelerating with the pricing is not? Or are they pretty marked to each other pretty quickly?', 'Joel Reiss', ""Yes. I think they're generally going to be pretty close to one another. Obviously, our teams are focused on driving productivity. The same team, our teams are trying to make sure that we've priced the product appropriately."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.', 'Robert Michael Spingarn', ""As a follow-up on that last answer, on Noah's question on inflation, we think about commercial OE and defense, which I would think would be different than commercial aftermarket where you can price in real time. How much of that revenue base is tied to long-term agreements that may have some stale pricing still to work through and can be renegotiated, let's say, over the next year or two? So what I'm asking is if there's upside in those 2 groups because of LTAs?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Yes, I would say the bulk of our OEM business is on LTAs and those continue to roll off and be renegotiated. So that's really a constant thing throughout the space. So yes, there is opportunity to improve clawback inflation that you haven't been able to over -- you've had to eat for a couple of years. So yes, that is always a possibility."", 'Robert Michael Spingarn', ""Okay. And Kevin, just high-level question on your workforce. You guys are just consistently executing the margins where we would expect or better. But for everyone else in the industry there are workforce issues. And recovering workforce or labor from COVID, getting people trained and so on. Is it fair to characterize those folks is different than TransDigm? Or are there things that we can't see?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Yes. I think people -- there's different business models. I think our ability to pass along inflation means that we ought to be able to respond to labor in the marketplace and make sure that we always have the best people and adequate resources to drive our business. But let's not forget that TransDigm is also an incredible operations excellence machine, and we drive productivity every day in our businesses, and we're constantly investing in that. Anything else to add, Joel?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""Yes. And the other thing I'd add to what Kevin said, I mean, unfortunately, I think the labor markets continue to improve which is certainly helpful. And we had some locations where we saw higher turnover a couple of years ago. I think that's really kind of going back to more normal levels, but we've put a lot of time and effort into training our folks. And as Kevin said, we've worked over the last few years to put more and more automation in place, which certainly mitigates what the impact of that is. And so I think we're well positioned going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research.', 'Louis Harold Raffetto', 'So I know within defense, you said aftermarket growth outpaced OE. Just curious what like magnitude is different there or just pretty similar.', 'Joel Reiss', 'Defense aftermarket was up more it was not significant, but defense aftermarket did outpace defense OEM.', 'Louis Harold Raffetto', ""And was there anything sort of -- I won't say onetime, but that stood out and that drove that growth? I know you said easy comp to some extent, but anything else in there?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""Yes. So first, there's -- we just have the normal kind of lumpiness within the defense sector similar to commercial aftermarket. Obviously, as we mentioned, the kind of easier comp. It was pretty broad across the -- our businesses. I mean, the vast majority of our businesses actually saw a pretty good increase year-over-year for Q1 versus Q1. I was kind of calling out one business and it wasn't a onetime set of work was Armtec, our flare countermeasures business had a really solid Q1 shipments coming and certainly in comparison to where they were a year ago at the same time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.', 'Robert Alan Stallard', ""It's probably a question for Sarah. On the debt issuance, I was wondering if you could comment on why you did it now, given if it could be still some time until the Electron Devices' acquisition closes?"", 'Sarah Wynne', ""Yes. I mean we're always going to be proactive by having cash ready for pending acquisitions. We want to be opportunistic on that front. And we don't want to be obviously up against any time line except the markets weren't open."", 'Robert Alan Stallard', ""Okay. And then as a follow-up, we're probably in a changing interest rate environment, and rates could be coming down over the next 12 months. How do you think you're going to be adjusting the balance sheet and the interest rate derivatives you have in place to try and make the most of that?"", 'Sarah Wynne', ""Obviously, we're always looking at the market and trying to be opportunistic with that debt structure. We do have the benefit of hedges. So from that perspective, we've [fortuned out] to 75% hedged. We've got some stuff coming up, and we'll continue to look and be opportunistic as long we can with our debt going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.', 'Gautam J. Khanna', 'I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the things in the M&A pipeline, you mentioned small to midsize? Is there -- is it still kind of skewed to hardware-oriented stuff? Or are you also entertaining some of these service assets? And maybe if you could just give us an update on how Calspan has done relative to what you guys were thinking originally given that...', 'Kevin M. Stein', ""On the M&A pipeline of small, medium-sized businesses mostly in hardware, although we're looking also at some services businesses, if they would meet our criteria. It's not always clear that some of those do. But we're open as long as it's within aerospace and defense. I don't think we see the need of going outside of aerospace and defense, not for a while. There's still so many great targets to go after in this business. On Calspan, I'll let Joel comment."", 'Joel Reiss', ""Yes. So I think we're encouraged by where we're at, at this point in the integration. We've got our leadership team in place. We've put our business unit teams structure in place. We're going through the value generation strategy that we employ. And as of right now, I think we're running a bit ahead of the model, and we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing."", 'Gautam J. Khanna', 'Just as a follow-up in the M&A hardware pipeline, is it mostly defense-oriented stuff? Is it -- I mean, just is there any...', 'Kevin M. Stein', ""No, it's actually -- it has a nice blend of commercial and defense assets. It's not only just defense. It's hard to control. You can't really dictate what the pitches will be thrown at you. So you just have to react to them when they come along. Right now, we see a nice balance. That isn't always the case, but today it is."", 'Gautam J. Khanna', 'Okay. And just my last one. In the commercial aero aftermarket, any discernible differences between growth rates into the distribution channel versus direct to customer?', 'Joel Reiss', ""So distribution represents about 20% to 25% of our commercial aftermarket shipments. As we look at the point of sale that our distribution partners are seeing in comparable markets is pretty close to one another. There's no significant difference."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.', 'Kristine Liwag', ""Kevin, another question on the pipeline. You've mentioned the target-rich environment and assets are coming up that weren't available before. In the past, you've mentioned that you're open to doing deals that have some industrial exposure. Can you update us on your current thinking? And what proportion maximum industrial would you be willing to entertain at this point based on what's available?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""It's interesting question and gets me into speculation. I don't know if there's a certain percentage that would kick a deal out. We want to be in aerospace and defense. If there are non-aerospace and defense products or business, that's okay. We don't thumb our nose at it, but we look at a business in its totality, can it achieve our 20% plus internal rate of return for that acquisition. Yes, we don't look scantly at those businesses, but we don't want to go after anything that's industrial only. So I would guess it has to be predominantly aerospace."", 'Kristine Liwag', ""Great. And maybe on aftermarket, if I could have a follow-up question. With customer behavior, I mean, there's clear scarcity of aircraft assets out there. How much of the volume that you're seeing are coming from an ad hoc break-and-fix type thing versus airlines potentially proactively purchasing product?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""I don't think we have any real meaningful way to understand that. The vast majority of our commercial aftermarket orders are booked to ship. They come in over the trends of they're typically not advanced bookings and we don't get the color in terms of why they're buying. We try to watch and make sure there's no inventory significant moves, but hard to get that kind of level of granularity."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.', 'Matthew Carl Akers', ""I guess the M&A deals that you've looked at that haven't closed. What's the main thing preventing the valuation? Is it strategic ticket -- because it seems like you're looking at the deals and you get the balance sheet to do more."", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Yes. It's -- do they meet our disciplined criteria. We want to see aftermarket content. We want it to be aerospace and defense. We prefer commercial over defense, but the biggest reason is whether they really have IP, whether they're highly engineered intellectual property, that's the key. So that's what we look for and that's what we screen against. And when deals fall apart, it's because things aren't as proprietary as we would like them to be. And so we walk away from -- we're not interested in being in the me-too product space like everyone else. I mean we're not trying to build the print business. We want high IP, high engineering content in aerospace and defense that has access to the aftermarket."", 'Matthew Carl Akers', ""Got it. And then I guess, back to your comments on some of the aerospace OE supply chain issues. Is that more around your supply chain, your suppliers are more just sort of Boeing and Airbus in general slowing down? And is it possible to comment kind of what you're assuming for 737 MAX for this year?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""Yes. So it's not specific for us the comments around the supply chain. I think that is what we're generally hearing from others. I think our supply chain team has done a really solid job of working through the challenges that have persisted for the last couple of years. Last year, we were talking about castings and then electronic components, I think largely, those have gone away. I do think we're in some level of a new normal where there's more kind of issues that pop up randomly in comparison to where we were from a pre-pandemic level, although I think that too is getting better, but likely that's going to persist for the next couple of years. I don't think any of that's material. I think right now, our assumption is based not so far off of what Boeing's current stated rate is in terms of what the FAA's numbers are. We always put a little bit level of conservatism around the number. And I think we -- we think our guidance is pretty well set around what we're hearing Airbus and Boeing are doing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""I wanted to ask about margins. First with Calspan. It looks like for the first quarter, you guys had owned it, it was about 20% margin, and now you're at 28% for this quarter. So you're still guiding to it to be 100 basis points dilutive, which obviously is conservative. It would imply you're going to end the year at 16% margins for that business. So I guess, what did you guys do to raise margins 100 bps in the last quarter? And where can this business be organically?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""Well, I'm not sure I know where it's going to go long term. Our goal is to implement our value generation strategy. We think it's a good business. We'll continue to work to maximize the value. In terms of any other guidance beyond that, I mean we -- I think we've highlighted we think it's dilutive, obviously, at the level that it's at in comparison to overall TransDigm, and we'll continue to work to improve the value over a long ownership."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', 'Okay. And then I wanted to ask about defense aftermarket. Again, our defense, just given that often you see it outperform commercial aftermarket. You mentioned Armtec. What percentage of your business is maybe more short cycle weapons oriented? And where do we think about defense relative to commercial OE margins perhaps?', 'Joel Reiss', ""Defense margins are -- comparable defense margins are lower than their kind of equivalent commercial markets. We typically offer a discount to the defense world. In terms of weapon systems, there is not, I don't have any good detailed split for what that looks like. In some ways, as I said, the lumpiness of the orders in the defense world is not so different than the commercial aftermarket and the standpoint that we don't get a lot of visibility of an order coming in. We'll get a solicitation, we work to respond. And when outlays are good, that generally helps us out. But beyond that, I'm not sure if there's any more kind of color I have on that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Kenneth George Herbert', ""Kevin, in the past, you've talked about the business organically supporting about 100 basis points of margin expansion each year across the cycle. As we think about maybe aftermarket mixing down over the next couple of years relative to defense or commercial OE and just with where margins are today, is that still the right framework as we think about organically for the business?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""I think it still is. I don't think it's going to change. I know that there's math involved here, and you got to work your way through it. But what I always say is 100 to 150 basis points of improvement and we've been running 150. Yes, it may be back down at 100, but it's still, I believe, going to sequentially expand."", 'Kenneth George Herbert', ""Okay, that's great. And as you look at the business today, just to that point, obviously, you've always run a pretty lean ship and kept costs pretty tight. Operationally, as you look across the business, are there still significant areas where you see opportunities for improvement? Or can execution be maybe a bigger piece of the mix moving forward relative to -- maybe relative to volume or price?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""Well, for productivity, this is again one of our 3 value-generating strategies. Our teams are challenged themselves to work to offset inflation over the entire cost structure of the business. And so automation continues to come down in price, things that we would have looked at 2 and 3 years ago, that didn't make sense or the capability wasn't there. Those come across. We continue to look at opportunities to how we resource materials where possible. So I think we continue to believe there's a lot of opportunity for us in productivity. I'm always encouraged when I can see a long-term TransDigm business 10, 15, 20 years since we acquired it, and they are still achieving as good or better at times level of productivity.That's partly because things that they looked at before weren't there. We also won a sizable amount of new business. And one of the great things about new business, it continues to give you an opportunity to find new ways to reduce the cost of those new products as well. So I think we think all 3 value drivers are where we want to focus."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.', 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Just a quick question on working capital moving forward. I'm just kind of curious what kind of contractual terms do you have with some of your commercial OEM customers on the need to hold inventory? One of the things you've got potentially going on here with Boeing is them asking the supply chain to continue producing [at rate], but they're going to be producing as something to the master schedule that might be actually above their production rates, and that inventory has got to go somewhere. So I'm just kind of curious, where that inventory might land from a contractual perspective, might some of the land on your balance sheet? Just kind of curious how it all works."", 'Sarah Wynne', ""Yes. I don't think we have any of that. For Boeing, it would be small, very noise level. And especially if you're asking from a bigger picture perspective, with working capital as a whole, we project future net working capital needs and I would just model fairly flat for that as a percent of sales as we go forward through the year with that being noise level, if anything."", 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the aftermarket side and the strong bookings that you saw. In the quarter, you suggest it's hard to know exactly where all of that demand is coming from, whether it's rate fix or kind of planned stocking by the airlines. But I'm curious if you've gotten kind of any feedback from your airline customers on how they're kind of grappling with what's going on with the GTFs in the [plant], OEGs that we're likely to see here -- this calendar year going into 2024. Is that, from your perspective, helping your aftermarket bookings here in the near term, that's kind of what we're seeing in the strike that you've seen here recently and Kevin, as you mentioned the potential for upward pressure on the guidance for the year. Just kind of curious if that's what's driving that statement that you made there?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""Yes. We've tried to take a look at it. We think it probably has a slight tailwind for the business. For a few of our businesses, it's helping out, obviously, those platforms that were older planes are flying more. This is helpful. But we're also getting fewer hours on the GTF engine. So some other sites that would start to see some benefit of longer flight hours and those that are kind of missing out. I think net for net, as we've looked at it, we think it's a slight tailwind for the business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America.', 'Mariana Perez Mora', ""My question is, I'd like to peel the onion a little bit on the commercial aftermarket. On this mid-teens guidance that you have, how much of that is driven by volumes, how much is pricing? And in that pricing, how much is like passing through inflation and labor costs and just like supply chain disruption things? And how much is actually being able to price this excess demand environment in the aftermarket?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""We don't comment on price and volume and that -- and split that out. It's kind of difficult for us to assess that anyway. So yes, we don't give that kind of color. For volume, what we can offer is looking at takeoff and landings, RPMs, clearly, volume is going to continue to grow and expand. And I believe we all gave you in our prepared comments that we think volumes are going to return in 2024 here, and we may actually then see growth ahead of where we were pre-COVID, but we don't get into parsing out how much is price and how much is volume."", 'Mariana Perez Mora', 'And are you able to discuss how open our customers to have price increase conversations at least?', 'Kevin M. Stein', 'I think that our focus on operational excellence and performance means that the pricing part of the conversation is often quite simpler because you can provide products on time to their needs.', 'Mariana Perez Mora', 'And my second question, if I may, on M&A. Why are so many M&A deals available right now? Has something changed?', 'Joel Reiss', ""I don't know if anything's changed. I think it just comes in waves sort of a sign wave. You have periods of time where it's up and periods of time where it's lower. It's been an encouraging time over the last, I think, a year or so. We've seen some good deals. Unfortunately, we've seen some things not work out, and we had to pass on. But I'm not aware of any outside forces moving more deals to the table. It's just the way it is."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.', 'Peter J. Arment', ""Nice results. Kevin, maybe just a quick one on Defense. I know it's about 30% of your mix. Do you have much exposure from international defense and if you do, just kind of what you're seeing there?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', 'Yes, we do have international defense exposure. We provide products to our allies and we also have manufacturing facilities in Europe that provide products directly to European defense contractors.', 'Peter J. Arment', 'Any rate of change differences there or just kind of still at normalized rates?', 'Kevin M. Stein', 'Have you seen any, Joel?', 'Joel Reiss', ""I don't know if there's anything significant versus the U.S. I mean the U.S. in many cases, is buying for military and they're supporting the same. So it ends up to some level of kind of co-mingled and hard to separate one versus the other."", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Clearly, I think international defense is improving, whether it is improving faster than the U.S. rate, I'm skeptical."", 'Peter J. Arment', ""Okay. That's helpful, Joel. And just a quick follow-up. When you gave the color on kind of the MAX rates and just in general, I was wondering if you could provide a little more color like what you're seeing on your suppliers. Is everyone seemed to be synced up and just broadly on the OEM kind of published rates? Are you seeing any suppliers that are still behind, and this is an opportunity to catch up?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""When you're saying suppliers as in like -- because we obviously sell to the airframers as well as..."", 'Peter J. Arment', 'Yes. Your suppliers.', 'Joel Reiss', ""Our suppliers to us. I don't think that there's anything significant. I mean we're still well -- as Kevin put in his opening remarks, we're still well below the peak we were at pre-COVID. 787, I think, was running at 14 aircraft per month. And so I don't think, from that standpoint, our suppliers have that issue. I think it's just been very sporadic. We can't get a certain component in, they've got to ramp it up. I don't know that there's anything specific material, but I think we believe right now we're well positioned for the -- where we are and can support a higher ramp-up rate."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', 'Nice result. Kevin, maybe just back to the aero -- the commercial aftermarket. Anything you parse out from demand trends or actual booking sales, wide-body, narrow-body airframe engine? I know you flagged interiors. Is that maybe a function of just more retrofit activity or any noticeable trends?', 'Joel Reiss', ""I think on the interior side, we're really just at the early innings of refurbishment. We're starting to see a few of those programs. Again, I think we're anticipating seeing more of that likely as we get to the end of this year and into early next year. A few of them we originally thought might have happened earlier have slid to the right. In terms of passenger, I don't know if we have any specific data to tell you, single-aisle versus wide-body. Certainly, we're encouraged by the continuing improving trends in the international market. So that still lags the single-aisle market but continues to be on a good rate of growth. I don't know that we have any specific data. I mean with the number of part numbers we sell, it's too difficult to try to come back to some specific around single-aisle widebody, unfortunately, at that level of granularity."", 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', 'Got it. Got it. And then maybe, Kevin, just one last one on M&A. You keep talking about the small and medium-sized pipeline. What is sort of your definition? I mean CPI, I guess, $300 million. How big is sort of the upper range of a medium-sized transaction?', 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Yes, probably somewhere around $1 billion plus. But not $4 billion that becomes bigger for us. So hopefully, that gives you some -- there's no science here."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons with UBS.', 'Gavin Eric Parsons', ""Maybe on CapEx, what's driving the big step-up this year?"", 'Sarah Wynne', ""Yes. On the CapEx, obviously, we're always looking to add infrastructure to our op units and provide cash with productivity improvement, much like what Joel just mentioned with machinery and other efficiencies in the op units to help drive -- the value drivers. Nothing specific -- there's one thing in that. It's just the usual CapEx that we provide to the op units based on their needs and driving the value."", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Yes. Our process, it comes -- these requests come from the sites. So our goal is to keep them fully funded. And if they see great productivity projects, that's where the bulk of our CapEx goes to. But I would also say one thing that's different from years past is we're now doing more solar types of programs that we wouldn't have done in the past. They have great payback, but that has been an added need for us on the CapEx side."", 'Gavin Eric Parsons', 'Interesting. Appreciate that detail. And I know a lot of aerospace work needs to be manual, but how much automation do you think you can get in the business over time?', 'Joel Reiss', ""I don't know that we have any specific numbers. I kind of highlighted. Suppose If you asked me the same question 5 years ago, I probably have a very different answer. I continue to be impressed by the ways that we've been able to incorporate as one of our businesses in the U.K. last month, and they've automated painting operations, polishing operations, brazing operations. So I think we continue to be optimistic that as automation costs come down as the cobots prices comes down is that it becomes easier and easier for us to incorporate it. Our challenges were a low mix -- sorry, high-mix, low-volume manufacturer. And so the challenge is to be able to do automation, but be able to do it for many, many part numbers, not just one very small subset of parts. And I think we believe there's still a lot of opportunity for that."", 'Gavin Eric Parsons', 'Got it. And I think Noah asked about kind of the price cost spread. Have you guys seen your input costs starting to ease or not yet?', 'Kevin M. Stein', ""I think we're still in the early innings for that. Labor costs, I think, are probably starting to -- as you see in the overall market, but I don't know that there's anything significant at this point. It's really too early in the fiscal year for us to have seen something dramatically different than planned."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""Wanted to ask about -- I may be misremembering here, but if we go back to sort of the pre-COVID days, maybe even (inaudible) days, I think kind of the cash balance to think about was something in the $750 million range. A lot of stuff has changed since then. I think if we do pro forma for the pending acquisition, probably at about $2 billion right now. How do we think about what's the appropriate cash balance now and going forward?"", 'Sarah Wynne', ""Yes. We're not anchored into a specific amount as you could obviously say. We're happy to keep cash on the balance sheet. And like you pointed out, we have $2 billion of pending CPI acquisition, which is obviously more than we need to run the business, but we're happy to have that cash on hand to support any other opportunities, M&A or any other investments that pop up for us."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""Okay. Okay. Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I thought that last answer to Gavin's question was interesting. When you think about -- I think when we hit the pandemic and all the rates came down, most of the -- the more labor-intensive part of your business is in the commercial OE piece. And so there is probably an expectation that as rates came up, you'd be adding employees. And so we're certainly far from fully back up, but we've kind of come off the bottom. Has the amount of labor that you've added off the bottom, has it been kind of consistent with what you might have expected, less or more? And why?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""I think our teams have worked hard over the last 3, 4 years to continue to find good productivity projects. And so I if I -- I don't have any specific numbers in front of me, but I would think that we're probably trending better than what we would have anticipated if we were looking at the same thing 3, 4 years ago. We had some learning curves I said, with turnover a couple of years ago, but I think the good news is with the lower rates that we've had, we've had a good opportunity to get those folks up to speed. So I think we think we're positioned well going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.', 'Scott Deuschle', ""Joel, is F-35 aftermarket is significant portion of defense aftermarket revenue at this point? And then can you comment at all on how quickly that's been growing recently?"", 'Joel Reiss', ""I don't have any specifics around any platform to give you. I think as we said, the defense aftermarket was a good solid quarter for us. I think considering the number of business it was distributed, I think we saw many, many platforms benefiting from it in the quarter, not just a single one. Certainly, as F-35 continues to fly, that's beneficial for us. We're on effectively every platform. And so certainly, the more things are used, the more -- that's just good for us in general."", 'Scott Deuschle', ""Okay. And then, Sarah, sort of following up on Jason's question. Can you clarify what the outlook is on working capital this year? It was a pretty big headwind last year. You had a strong first quarter here. I was just curious where things go from here on."", 'Sarah Wynne', ""Yes. You're right. We had an influx of about, I think, it's $500 million last year. So we think we're now in a good position so that going forward, we'd expect working capital to follow the revenue as a percent of sales -- fairly flat as the revenue goes up as a percentage."", 'Scott Deuschle', ""Okay. And then last question, Kevin. It's been a while since the last Investor Day. Any plans for another one sometime soon?"", 'Kevin M. Stein', ""Yes, this summer. Yes. We more than expected.

Or is that not really shown up on your radar just given those markets are smaller?', 'Joel Reiss', ""I don't think we've seen any material change this year. USM is typically not a big factor for us.

A big reason: your local hospital.', 'Healthcare contributed 70,000 jobs in January, accounting for almost 20% of additions to the American workforce. The new hires included people who work in hospitals, outpatient centers, and nursing and residential care facilities.', 'Investors can expect that strong hiring to continue this year, experts say, because of a structural shift underway as the pandemic recedes: Hospitals are relying less on the temporary help they needed when COVID-19 was at its peak and more on full-time staff as normal routines return.', 'This workforce restructuring is a blessing for healthcare providers that had to shell out big money for traveling nurses during the pandemic but a potential reckoning for publicly traded staffing companies that provided many of those contract workers.', '""The healthcare industry is healing and better able to meet peak demand when needed,"" Courtney Shupert, an economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives, told Yahoo Finance. ""And so it means that firms ... can hire more permanent, full-time employees and maybe rely less on some of those expensive contract nurses and just contract labor in general.""', 'To understand why healthcare hiring is changing, it helps to understand how COVID-19 upended staffing across the industry. As turnover accelerated and demand spiked in different parts of the US, hospitals turned to contract nurses for help.', 'Overall, total healthcare staffing more than tripled during that time, with the travel nurse subsegment growing even faster, Trevor Romeo, a research analyst at William Blair & Company, told Yahoo Finance.', ""Those nurses weren't cheap. For instance, AMN Healthcare Services (AMN) in 2019 billed hospitals $75.49 per hour for temp staffers who were largely nurses, according to data from Romeo. That then surged to $145.34 per hour in March 2022, or almost double the pre-pandemic rate."", 'The use of these contract workers has begun to unwind as hospitals take on a larger permanent workforce. Some of the job gains in the healthcare sector have been offset by losses in the temporary staffing sector, according to Shupert.', '""While temp services are a smaller share of total employment than healthcare, you can see these two industries moved more inversely since 2020, especially in 2023, when temp services continued to decline while healthcare employment continued to grow,"" she said.', 'Still the need for more healthcare staff remains. Patient volumes are robust as folks are now getting procedures they put off during the pandemic. Add to that aging baby boomers needing more healthcare services, a long-term trend that will continue to grow.', 'For example, HCA Healthcare (HCA) was able to accept 90% of patients coming into its healthcare facilities at the end of the year.', '""In other words, we weren\'t able to take roughly 10% of the patients who were referred to us,"" HCA CEO Sam Hazen said on the company\'s fourth quarter earnings call at the end of January. ""What we have seen is more patients coming through our transfer centers and other patient navigation programs than we did in 2019.""', ""At the same time, many of the nurses and other healthcare staff who traveled during the pandemic didn't return to their home bases, leaving their original hospitals, especially in more rural states, understaffed."", '""It\'s almost like an emergency situation in places like Mississippi, where they ran out of nurses because everyone traveled and … as things normalized, not all the nurses that left states like that came back,"" Brian Tanquilut, an equity analyst at Jefferies, told Yahoo Finance. ""So there\'s a geographic and a migration component that has contributed to some of that recruiting or hiring that you\'re seeing, especially for nursing.""', 'And now there appears to be some declining interest in nursing careers altogether. Enrollment in Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs fell by 1.4% from 2021 to 2022, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the first decline since 2000.', '""So that\'s another indicator that the critical nursing shortage that we see isn\'t going away anytime soon,"" Romeo said.', 'To manage the current and expected increase in demand, hospitals are boosting their permanent workforce while lowering their dependence on contract workers.', ""For instance, HCA's contract labor declined 20% for the year in 2023, the company's CFO said, with those costs comprising 5.3% of the company's fourth quarter salaries, wages, and benefits expenses, down from 7.1% in its first quarter last year."", 'Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) has seen an even starker reduction. By the fourth quarter of 2023, contract labor made up just 2.8% of consolidated salaries, wages, and benefits, a 62% reduction from 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022.', '""Our investments in nurse recruitment and retention have paid dividends as we have strengthened our workforce and effectively reduced contract labor spend throughout the year,"" CEO Saumya Sutaria said on the company\'s latest earnings call on Thursday.', 'A reduction in contract labor provides significant savings. Even though rates have declined some, temp nurses are still charging about 20% more than pre-COVID levels, according to Tanquilut, which is more pricey than full-time staffers.', ""The hourly rate AMN Healthcare charged hospitals for temp workers was $96.43 at the end of 2023, according to Romeo's data. That was down 51% from the March 2022 level, but still up 28% from 2019 rates."", '""So there\'s still a premium that they\'re charging,"" Tanquilut said. ""So it\'s better bottom line-wise to have just those permanent people [and] from a care quality perspective, most hospitals would prefer to have the permanent nurses who are very familiar with the facility.""', 'For future needs, some hospitals are creating their own in-house temp staffing companies, or float pools. These allow nurses who typically work three times a week for 12-hour stretches to voluntarily sign up for additional shifts if they want and if the need arises.', '""There certainly is an effort from the hospitals to still reduce their labor costs and address or reduce their reliance on these contract agencies,"" Tanquilut said.', ""The change in staffing shows up in the stock performance of the two major healthcare staffing agencies — AMN Healthcare Services and Cross Country Healthcare (CCRN). Both stocks peaked in late October 2022. Since then, AMN shares have fallen 41%, and Cross Country's stock has lost 48% in value."", '""We anticipated a market reset was coming,"" AMN CEO Cary Grace acknowledged in November during the company\'s third quarter earnings call. ""But it has been deeper and more sustained than we and the rest of the industry expected.""', ""While AMN doesn't report its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results until Feb. 15, with Cross Country following on Feb. 21, Romeo offered a preview. He said the temp nursing business dropped 30% to 35% year over year in 2023, and, even worse for these companies, that decline is likely not over."", '""Our expectation at this point is for another 20% or so decline in that market in 2024,"" Romeo said. ""The question is when do we see that point of stability … and my best guess at this point is in the second half of 2024.""', ""In the meantime, AMN and Cross Country are capitalizing on the one area where contract healthcare staffing is increasing, and that's temporary physicians, which didn't boom like nursing did in the pandemic, Romeo said. Last year, the temp physician staffing market grew 10% to 15%, Romeo said, and it's expected to expand another 7% to 10% in 2024."", '""It\'s a smaller part of their businesses, but actually both of them have made acquisitions in that space lately,"" Romeo said.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

Mattel reported that sales rose 16% from the prior year in the fourth quarter on strong demand for all things Barbie and Hot Wheels.', 'But the overall report fell shy of what some on the Street were whispering about. The company is forecasting flat sales this year. But more than 10% earnings growth supported by a new $1 billion stock buyback plan. This as Mattel looks to fend off noted activist investor Barrington Capital.', 'Joining me now is Mattel chairman and CEO Ynon Kreiz. Ynon, always nice to get some time with you. So a really big quarter for you guys. Barbie sales up pretty significantly, as you would expect given the success of the ""Barbie"" movie. Can you unpack some of the drivers of that Barbie sales number? Because I think it would go a long way to informing investors on how the brand might do this year.', ""YNON KREIZ: Yes, Brian. Great to be here. And let me start by saying that it was a very strong fourth quarter for the company with double-digit growth in top and bottom line and significant margin expansion. It was a milestone year for the company, not just the quarter. In addition to the incredible success of the Barbie movie, which we couldn't be more proud of. We extended our leadership in key toy categories and gained significant share overall. And further strengthen our financial position."", ""You talk about execution. We generated more than $700 million of free cash flow, which is more than 2 and 1/2 times the prior year. So with that, we continue to execute our strategy. As you mentioned, we just announced a $1 billion share buyback program. And believe we're in an excellent position to continue to execute our strategy."", 'And it wasn\'t just the ""Barbie"" movie. Of course, this highlighted much of the success. But there\'s so much more. The ""Barbie"" movie itself contributed about $150 million of top line and approximately $90 million of operating income. This is participation in box office and all of the movie-related merchandising and toys.', 'So this is really an example for one movie in one year. And the potential is exciting for Mattel films and, overall, for our entertainment strategy.', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Ynon, JP Morgan caught my attention recently. They downgraded Mattel. And they mentioned, there\'s a wall of worry with investors. Can you outperform what you did last year? Maybe speak to that point. Can you out Barbie ""Barbie?"" Can you show improving margins in your business this year after the blockbuster year you had last year?', ""YNON KREIZ: Well, you've been following our story. And you know that we've been consistently executing quarter after quarter, year after year.

You will see continued expansion and profit improvement in the margin expansion of our toy business, as we continue to accelerate the execution of our entertainment strategy."", 'The portfolio has one of the strongest offering of children and family entertainment brands in the world. Our franchises are working. And we continue to execute on that approach. What we guided to in 2024 is to continue to improve profitability, gain market share, and expand our margin.

I've been covering your leadership at Mattel pretty much since day one in the company longer than that. And that experience really informed my next comment here. I didn't like that letter that Barrington Capital sent to you. Didn't like it at all."", ""To me, it came off, as someone or a group that didn't really understand the toy business, didn't appreciate what you've been doing over at Mattel. But I want to go through this tick by tick because you guys came out last night, came out with a new billion dollar program. That team over there suggested you do $2 billion."", 'Will going to $2 billion hurt your balance sheet? Why not go to that number?', 'YNON KREIZ: Well, we always welcome feedback from our shareholders and are happy to have a conversation with our investors. We are focused on executing our strategy. And our goals are very much aligned with all of our shareholders to create long-term value.', ""And without getting into the details of the letter, as a management team, we'll always look for ways to continue to create value and strengthen the company and position it for growth. The $1 billion share repurchase program that we announced is the right amount in our mind that is in sync with our capital allocation priorities, with our balance sheet. And reflects our confidence in the continued execution of our strategy. And that we'll be able to continue to position the company for long-term value creation."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: The letter also mentioned that this investor Barrington, who didn't reply to several requests for me to comment on this one, Fisher-Price and American Girl should be sold now. These are iconic toy brands."", 'You walk into a toy store. These are brands parents know. And they have known for many years. Do you think the performance of these brands is holding back the multiple that your stock can afford or receive?', ""YNON KREIZ: We all been following also. We've been talking and been pretty transparent about both Fisher-Price and American Girl. As a management team, we always evaluate our portfolio. And we would like to have all of our brands grow and be in a strong position."", 'We do have work to do on Fisher-Price. And we are doing it. We recently announced-- a few weeks ago, we announced a leadership change and continue to put our mind and bring our incredible capabilities in design and development, in supply chain, in our global commercial organization that is second to none in our industry to make sure that these brands are positioned for long-term growth.', ""And, again, without commenting specifically on a letter or any advice for our shareholders that as I said, we're always open to hearing, we are very focused on execution. We believe we have the right capabilities in the company. And as it relates to these brands, when you talk about Fisher-Price, and you said it yourself, it's a cherished brand. It's one of the most known brands in the industry. It had a strong quarter. It was up double digit. It continued to gain share."", 'Little People performed exceptionally strong with expanded adult collector line. In 2024, Fisher-Price will expand its core product lines, enter a new segment, extended license, entertainment offering, and continue to exit lower margin segments in order to focus on profitability.', 'So Fisher-Price is a valued asset. And we are confident in the long-term growth potential of the category as a whole.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: All right. Very important to hear that from you. And then I know, lastly, Ynon, you have a really, I would say, a key investor day coming up in March, where you're going to outline some new plans and innovation for the year ahead. Anything you can share on what you might share at that event?"", ""YNON KREIZ: Yeah. We're looking to share more of the development and innovation of new product offering. How we think about the evolved playbook of Mattel in terms of design, development. The continued evolution of our entertainment strategy, not just in film, but in the other exciting verticals, where we are looking to participate, such as television, consumer product and merchandise, location-based entertainment, digital, and other experiences that would truly capitalize on the incredible potential and value we have in our iconic brand portfolio."", 'And it will be much about how do we, as a company, take brands that are timeless and make sure that they are timely, and continue to find cultural moments to engage with consumers, to engage with our fans and position the company for an exciting evolution on the IP strategy.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: We always appreciate your transparency, Ynon.

In digital gaming, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharge was released, and the first stand-alone Barbie game on Roblox was launched, achieving over 130 million visits since October. The Mattel163 joint venture grew its mobile gaming revenues to almost $200 million in 2023.

Today, we announced a new Optimizing for Profitable Growth Program that will target an additional $200 million of annualized savings between 2024 and 2026. The programs aim is to achieve further efficiencies and cost-saving opportunities that we believe can further improve our productivity, profitability and competitive position. Aligned with our capital deployment strategy, Mattel's Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We were also pleased to announce earlier today that Julius Genachowski and Dawn Ostroff have joined Mattel's Board of Directors."", 'Julius and Dawn are respected leaders who have extensive combined experience in media, entertainment and technology and bring expertise in finance, M&A, and government regulation. Todd Bradley and Ann Lewnes recently stepped down from the Board, and I would like to thank them for the many years of dedicated service. We are grateful for their support and guidance and playing an active role during their tenure. We are also excited to welcome Chris Farrell, who recently joined the company as Chief Strategy Officer. Chris brings expertise in strategic planning, M&A, corporate development and investment banking in the consumer and retail sectors. These additions will serve Mattel well as we execute our strategy, explore growth opportunities and enhance long-term shareholder value.', 'In terms of our expectations for the year, we believe we are well positioned competitively and will continue to outpace the industry and gain market share. We expect the toy industry to decline in 2024, although at a lesser rate than 2023. The anticipated decline is due to a lighter toyric theatrical film slate and the impact of the shift in consumer spending patterns towards experiences and services, which we believe will moderate over the year. Our 2024 plan emphasizes growth in profitability, gross margin expansion, and strong cash generation. With the benefit of a strong balance sheet and consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we intend to explore M&A and other corporate development opportunities, as well as repurchase shares.', ""Some of the highlights for 2024 include Barbie's 65th anniversary celebration and related activations, as well as innovation in new segments and play patterns. Hot Wheels will expand its die-cast universe and benefit from a new animated series on Netflix. Fisher-Price will expand its whole product lines, introduce an exciting new segment and extend its license entertainment offerings. In our Challenger categories will bring more innovative products to market. We look forward to sharing more details at our investor event in March, including our category strategies as well as power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. In addition, we will continue to progress our entertainment strategy in film and television as well as digital and live experiences."", ""We expect Mattel's net sales in constant currency for the full year to be comparable to prior year and for adjusted EPS to grow double-digit and be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $500 million. We expect our full year POS to be comparable to 2023 and aim to outpace the toy industry and gain market share. Beyond 2024, we believe toy industry trends will further improve and that the industry will return to growth and continue to grow over the long-term. The fundamentals of the toy business are strong. Toys are an important part of consumers' lives and retailers see the category as a strategic lever. For Mattel, we expect to grow sales and earnings in 2025 with the anticipated benefit of improving industry trends, innovation in toys, expansion of our entertainment offering and licensing partnerships as well as savings from our Optimizing for Profitable Growth Program."", 'In closing, 2023 was defined by our strong execution in both toys and entertainment. Consumer demand for our products continue to grow and meaningful market share gains demonstrated the strength of our portfolio as a whole. The breakout success of the award-winning Barbie movie was a showcase for our entertainment strategy and cultural relevance of our brands outside the toy aisle. Mattel is in the strongest financial position it has been in years, with significant free cash flow generation an optimization program and a new share repurchase authorization. As we start a New Year, we believe we are well positioned to continue the successful execution of our multiyear strategy to grow our IP-driven toy business and expand our entertainment offering and create long-term shareholder value.', 'Anthony will cover the financials in more detail.', 'Anthony DiSilvestro: Thanks, Ynon. As expected, we had a very strong fourth quarter with double-digit top and bottom line growth compared to the prior year. Net sales of $1.621 billion increased 16% or 14% in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin increased 570 basis points to 48.8%. Adjusted operating income was $147 million, an increase of $68 million or 86%, primarily driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion partly offset by an incentive-driven increase in SG&A. Adjusted EPS was $0.29 compared to $0.18 a year ago, an increase of 61%. And adjusted EBITDA was $234 million, an increase of $76 million. Looking at our full year performance. Net sales were flat or down 1%, excluding the positive impact of currency translation.', 'Adjusted gross margin increased 160 basis points to 47.5% and benefiting from cost savings, pricing and the Barbie movie. Adjusted operating income was $641 million compared to $689 million in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.23 compared to $1.25 last year, and adjusted EBITDA finished the year at $948 million compared to $968 million in the prior year. Retailers ended the year with inventory down high single-digits as measured in both dollars and weeks of supply. While they made significant progress in 2023, retailer inventories remained slightly elevated compared to historical norms. Turning to gross billings in constant currency, beginning with the fourth quarter. Gross billings increased 16% with growth in our three leader categories, including double-digit growth in all three power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price, as well as growth in our challenger categories collectively.', 'POS increased low single digits as we continued to outpace the industry and gain market share. As previously discussed, shipping patterns have returned to historical trends with approximately two-thirds of annual gross billings in the second half, which has favorably impacted our fourth quarter gross billings performance in comparison to the prior year. Dolls increased 27%, driven primarily by Barbie, Disney Princess and Frozen and Monster High. POS for the category increased low double-digits. Barbie had a very strong finish to the year with fourth quarter growth of 24%, driven by toys and benefits associated with the movie. Vehicles achieved another quarter of growth increasing 15%, driven by a 16% increase in Hot Wheels, which benefited from die-cast cars and continued innovation across multiple segments.', 'POS increased mid-single-digits. Infant, Toddler and Preschool increased by 7%, driven by double-digit growth in Fisher-Price. POS declined high-single-digits. Challenger categories in aggregate increased by 1%, primarily driven by gains, partly offset by a decline in Action Figures. POS declined high-single-digits primarily due to Action Figures. Turning to the full year. Gross billings declined by 1%, primarily due to the negative impact of retailer inventory reductions and Russia, partly offset by the benefits from low-single-digit POS growth and the very successful Barbie movie. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained 70 points of global market share per Circana. Dolls increased 13%, in line with POS driven by Disney Princess and Frozen, Monster High and Barbie, partly offset by a decline in American Girl.', 'Barbie increased 2%. The total impact from our direct movie participation, movie-related toy sales and consumer products, generated more than $150 million in sales with a blended operating income margin of approximately 60%. POS was flat. Mattel outperformed the industry in the Dolls category and gained 750 basis points of market share for the full year per Circana. Vehicles had another outstanding year growing 11%, in line with POS driven by Hot Wheels Die-Cast and the successful extension of the brand into the Skate and RC segments. Hot Wheels achieved its sixth consecutive record year. Mattel outpaced the industry in the Vehicles category, gained 280 basis points of market share reaching its highest global market share on record per Circana.', 'Infant, Toddler and Preschool declined 12% due to ImagineX, wrapping theatrical times in the prior year and Baby Gear, partly offset by Little People. POS declined high-single-digits. Despite the decline, Mattel outperformed the industry gained 10 basis points of market share and extended its number one position within the category per Circana. Challenger categories declined 25% due primarily to Action Figures comping a strong film fleet in the prior year. POS declined low double-digits. Building Sets and Games each grew gross billings for the year. Per Circana, Mattel gained market share and Building Sets for the full year. Looking at our fourth quarter performance by region. Growth was primarily driven by North America. Gross billings in North America increased 33%, benefiting from the return to historical shipping patterns.', 'POS increased mid-single-digits. EMEA grew 1% and while POS was up mid-single digits, growing ahead of the market. Asia Pacific increased 6%, driven by growth in Australia and New Zealand. POS increased mid-single-digits. Latin America increased 1% and POS was down mid-single-digits due to softness in Brazil. Looking at our full year performance on a regional basis. Gross billings in North America increased 1% with POS comparable to the prior year. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained 90 basis points of market share in North America per Circana.

Mattel gained market share and expanded its market leadership position in Latin America per Circana. Asia Pacific increased 11%, while POS increased low single digits. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained market share in the region per Circana. Adjusted gross margin was 48.8% in the quarter, compared to 43.1% in the prior year, an increase of 570 basis points. The significant increase in adjusted gross margin was driven by several factors. Cost deflation contributed 340 basis points, lower inventory management costs, primarily obsolescence and close-ups added 150 basis points. Savings from the Optimizing for Growth program added 130 basis points, favorable mix, primarily margin benefit related to the Barbie movie added 70 basis points.', 'And pricing, net of higher sales adjustments added 20 basis points. Going the other way, increased royalties and other factors had a negative impact of 140 basis points. For the full year, adjusted gross margin increased by 160 basis points to 47.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by cost savings the favorable mix impact associated with the Barbie movie and pricing, partly offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to lower production volume and other supply chain costs. Moving down to P&L. In the fourth quarter, advertising expenses declined 3% to $234 million. During the fourth quarter, we shifted some of our support from advertising to promotions, which are reflected in higher sales adjustments. For the full year, advertising expense declined 2% to $525 million.', 'As expected, SG&A increased significantly due to incentive compensation. Adjusted SG&A in the fourth quarter increased by $127 million to $409 million, reflecting above-target incentive compensation. For the full year, adjusted SG&A increased $147 million due to incentive compensation and salary and market-related pay, partly offset by savings from the Optimizing for Growth program. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $147 million, an increase of $68 million or 86% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by net sales growth and gross margin expansion, partly offset by higher SG&A. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $76 million to $234 million, driven by the same factors. Adjusted EPS increased 61% to $0.29. For the year, adjusted operating income declined $47 million to $641 million.', 'And adjusted EBITDA declined $21 million to $948 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.23, compared to $1.25 in the prior year. EPS performance benefited from higher interest income, a lower adjusted tax rate and a lower share count resulting from our share repurchase activity. We generated very significant cash flow in 2023. Cash from operations almost doubled to $870 million, compared to $443 million in the prior year, an increase of $427 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved working capital performance. Working capital was a source of funds in 2023, driven primarily by inventory reductions compared to a use of funds in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $160 million, compared to $187 million in the prior year and lower than our expectations, primarily due to the timing of expenditures on capacity additions.', ""Free cash flow was $709 million, compared to $256 million, an increase of $453 million. The increase was primarily driven by cash from operations and lower capital expenditures. As a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow conversion was 75%, compared to 26% in the prior year. During 2023, we utilized $203 million of cash to repurchase shares, fully utilizing the company's existing authorization. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we meaningfully improved our financial position. We finished the year with a cash balance of $1.261 billion, compared to $761 million in the prior year. The increase reflects our free cash flow performance for 2023, net of share repurchases. Total debt was $2.330 billion, consistent with the prior year. Our debt portfolio is well positioned with no scheduled maturities until 2026."", 'Accounts receivable increased by $222 million, in line with fourth quarter sales growth to $1.082 billion. We made significant progress reducing owned inventory levels. Inventory at year-end was $572 million, compared to $894 million in the prior year, a reduction of $322 million and a key contributor to free cash flow. Consistent with our expectations, debt to adjusted EBITDA finished the year at 2.5 times, excluding the benefit of our cash balance. This compares to 2.4 times in the prior year. Under our Optimizing for Growth program, we achieved cost savings of $46 million in the quarter and $132 million in the year. We have now completed this program. Under this program, we achieved total annualized savings of $343 million between 2021 and 2023, exceeding our initial target of $250 million and revised goal of $300 million.', ""We recognize the importance of managing our cost structure and continuing to expand margins as well as generating savings that can be reinvested in the business. Today, we are announcing a new three-year program that we are calling Optimizing for Profitable Growth or OPG. The program's aim is to achieve efficiencies, leveraging our scale and cost savings opportunities within our global supply chain, including our manufacturing footprint that we believe can further improve productivity, profitability and our competitive position. We are targeting $200 million of annualized savings between 2024 and 2026 under this new program, which includes the previously disclosed initiative to close a plant in China. In terms of the P&L, we anticipate approximately 70% of the expected savings to benefit cost of goods sold and the remaining 30% to benefit SG&A."", 'Costs and investments to implement the program are estimated to be between $130 million to $170 million, which will be updated as the program advances. We have a strong track record of achieving cost savings and are confident in our ability to execute this new program. As Ynon said, we expect the toy industry to decline in 2024 and for Mattel to outpace the industry and continue to gain global market share. For 2024, we expect net sales in constant currency to be comparable to the prior year, with growth in Vehicles, offset by a decline in Dolls as we wrap the benefits of the Barbie movie. We expect Infant, Toddler and Preschool as well as our Challenger categories collectively to be comparable to the prior year. With respect to the power brands, we expect Hot Wheels to grow, Fisher-Price to be comparable and for Barbie to decline.', 'Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the American Girl business is being integrated into our North America commercial organization. As a result, American Girl will no longer be an operating segment. Foreign currency translation is not expected to have a material impact on our top line performance based on current spot rates. Adjusted gross margin is expected to increase from 47.5% in 2023 to a range of 48.5% to 49%. The forecasted improvement is primarily driven by savings from our OPG program and favorable fixed cost absorption from increased production levels, partly offset by wrapping the Barbie movie benefit. We expect advertising and adjusted SG&A to remain relatively stable as a percent of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion compared to $948 million in the prior year.', 'Adjusted EPS is expected to grow double digits to a range of $1.35 to $1.45 compared to $1.23 in 2023. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be 23% to 24% compared to the prior year rate of 23%. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $500 million. As Ynon said, we are well positioned and expect to grow sales and earnings in 2025. We are operating in a macroeconomic environment that may impact consumer demand. The guidance considers what the company is aware of today, but remains subject to market volatility, unexpected disruptions and other risks and uncertainties. We have generated significant free cash flow and improved our financial position with a cash balance over $1.2 billion, achieved our targeted leverage ratio and an investment grade rating.', 'With our strong balance sheet and consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we are announcing a new multiyear share repurchase program with an authorization of $1 billion. This action reflects confidence in our strategy to grow sales and earnings and cash flow and create long-term shareholder value. We intend to fund repurchases with free cash flow. In closing, we finished the year with a strong fourth quarter performance. For the year, we grew POS, gained market share and generated significant free cash flow. Looking ahead, we are launching a new cost savings program, expect to improve profitability in 2024, announced a new share repurchase program and will continue to execute our strategy.

However, the formation of a hammer chart pattern in its last trading session indicates that the stock could witness a trend reversal soon, as bulls might have gained significant control over the price to help it find support.', 'The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this company enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.', 'Understanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade It', ""This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'"", ""In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price."", 'When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.', 'Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.', 'Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.', ""Here's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for NTRS"", ""An upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that NTRS has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements."", 'Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 7.6%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering NTRS are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.', ""If this is not enough, you should note that NTRS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

To skip our detailed analysis of the retail sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Discount Retailer Stocks to Buy.', ""The US economy's consistent battle with inflation has resulted in consumer spending habits being reshaped and transformed. Where once the shopping season saw consumers succumbing to higher prices as long as they brought back high-quality products for themselves and their loved ones, the fourth quart of 2023 saw a new trend emerging: bargain hunting."", 'Deloitte published an Emerging Retail Trends Report for the fourth quarter, which delved into the rise of this new trend. According to the report, US consumers are now seeking value in their purchases and avoiding high-priced items. They are beginning to ""hunt"" for bargains and deals, often frequenting discount retailers and off-price stores in favor of their usual shopping haunts in hopes of meeting their new needs. As a result of this shift in shopping behaviors, discount retail companies such as\xa0Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) can be considered well-placed to benefit from this emerging trend.', 'The Deloitte report noted that while 2021 and 2022 saw luxury retailers experiencing strong growth, 2023 saw this growth slowing. The second quarter of 2023 saw huge declines in growth for several luxury brands, some even suffering drops as high as 23%. As a result of this, many of these companies were seen to be prioritizing their discount business divisions, as these were the units attracting the most consumers.', 'As mentioned above, this shift in consumer spending habits and attitudes is beginning to prove overwhelmingly beneficial for discount and off-price retailers. For instance, The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) was mentioned by the Deloitte report as a discount retailer that reported ""strong gains in profit and revenue"" in its latest earning report. In the third quarter, The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) reported a revenue of approximately $13.3 billion, growing 9.03% year-over-year and beating estimates by $183.1 million. The company has reportedly benefitted immensely because of the increase in customer traffic after the shift to bargain hunting. Additionally, with many luxury retailers now finding their stores practically empty, companies like The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) have also found themselves gaining access to premium inventory items sold off by high-end retailers.', ""The shift to off-price retailers does not mean, however, that consumers don't want high-quality products anymore. They merely want to be more cautious in their approach to shopping now. By going to discount retailers hoping to find premium products on sale, they are doing just that."", 'According to the report, the only way luxury and discount retailers can regain and retain their customers is to work on increasing customer loyalty. Acts like simplifying the return process and engaging with customers over social media helpfully can go a long way in this respect. However, the actions of some retailers after the recent holiday season have been going in the exact opposite direction. On December 26, CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" team discussed how several retail companies have begun charging return fees to their customers after the holiday season. Additionally, retailers are also now shortening the return window for items purchased online. It was noted that about 40% of retailers are beginning to charge their customers for online returns, a 9% increase from the 31% figure reported in 2022.', 'This new development in the retail sector may have emerged as a desperate bid to retain profits. However, it is likely that such policies will alienate customers rather than increase their loyalty to a certain brand. In the long run, it may be inadvisable for retail companies to succumb to such measures, as the Deloitte report clarifies. The Squawk Box team also seemed to agree with the report in noting that ""nothing would disrupt customer loyalty"" more than placing huge return fees on purchased items.', 'Regardless of the above, it is evident that in the current market economy, consumers prefer stores that offer them products at discounted prices or as part of attractive deals. As a result, discount retailers are not only gaining popularity among the consumer base but also among investors as their profitability surges. As such, we have compiled a list of the best discount retailer stocks to buy. These include some of the best department store stocks to invest in, alongside several top discount retailer stocks for the long term.', 'Our Methodology', ""We selected the names for our list of the best discount retailer stocks to buy by consulting Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the third quarter of 2023.

(NYSE:BJ) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:"", '“BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:BJ)’s is the third largest warehouse club operator in the U.S., with locations primarily along the East Coast. The warehouse club business model has many attractive characteristics, offering a limited number of items in each product category (sold in large pack sizes) which allows them to drive down purchasing costs. These companies have low operating costs, efficient distribution networks, and are typically located in low-cost areas. Their no-frills stores, simple operations, and large real estate footprints create labor efficiencies. This allows for merchandise to be offered at very sharp prices. Customers gain access to these low prices by purchasing annual memberships to the clubs, which have high retention rates and generate steady, recurring revenue. The business earns high returns on capital despite low prices and operating margins. BJ’s has a checkered history but has made significant improvements to the business over the past decade. The market remains skeptical as to how sustainable these improvements are and how well they can compete against strong peers in the warehouse club industry. We believe this misses the mark, as the club industry commands a small share of a vast retail market. We believe all of the warehouse club operators can grow and take share from indirect competitors that can’t match their pricing.

With a diverse portfolio in business aviation, ship construction and repair, combat vehicles, and technology services, GD continues to solidify its market position. The company reported consolidated revenue growth, driven by its defense segments, particularly in submarine construction and combat systems. Despite supply chain constraints impacting the Aerospace segment's large-cabin aircraft deliveries, GD anticipates an increase in new aircraft deliveries, including the G700, in 2024. The Technologies segment saw an uptick in demand for IT services, attributed to strategic acquisitions and a focus on innovative solutions. GD's commitment to ethical practices and human capital management remains a cornerstone of its success, ensuring a skilled and dedicated workforce.

The acquisition of a C5ISR solutions business and the development of Digital Accelerators, such as AI for mission applications and hybrid multi-cloud, position GD at the forefront of defense technology. These innovations not only enhance GD's product offerings but also provide a competitive edge in securing government contracts and partnerships."", ""Robust Financial Performance: GD's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic management. With an aggregate market value of voting common equity held by non-affiliates at $55.6 billion as of July 2, 2023, and a solid increase in consolidated revenue across its defense segments, GD demonstrates a strong balance sheet and revenue growth trajectory.

These issues have increased costs and decreased operational efficiency, indicating a need for GD to enhance its supply chain resilience and mitigate such vulnerabilities to maintain its market position."", ""Cost Pressures and Margin Compression: GD's Marine Systems segment experienced margin decreases due to supply chain impacts on the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost growth on the DDG-51 program. Similarly, the Combat Systems segment saw lower-margin artillery facilities expansion work. These cost pressures suggest that GD must address operational inefficiencies and cost management to preserve profitability."", ""Dependence on Government Contracts: With approximately 70% of GD's revenue coming from the U.S. government, the company's financial performance is heavily reliant on government spending levels and defense appropriations.

The company's investments in emerging technologies like AI, cyber, and 5G can drive growth and open new revenue streams.

Continuing this approach can enable GD to access new markets, enhance its product portfolio, and build synergies that drive long-term growth. Collaborations with other industry players can also lead to innovative solutions and a broader customer base."", ""Competitive Market Dynamics: The defense and aerospace sectors are highly competitive, with several key players vying for market share. GD's Aerospace segment, in particular, faces competition based on factors like aircraft performance, service quality, and price. To maintain its competitive advantage, GD must continue to innovate and deliver superior products and services that meet evolving customer needs."", 'Regulatory and', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Every single member of the Wynn team should be incredibly proud of what they achieved together in 2023. Momentum in the business built throughout the year, and we ended on a high note with $632 million of property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, capping off a record year in which we generated nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA. We see tremendous value in our business as evidenced by our buybacks in the quarter and I'm genuinely looking forward to 2024. The company is more diversified than it's ever been. In Las Vegas, we continue to distance ourselves from peers as the leader in luxury and it's more evident than ever that we are the go-to spot for the best customers attending citywide events like F1."", 'We have a growing business in Macau that is running structurally higher margins than in the past, is much less reliant on the volatile VIP segment and is increasingly well positioned to compete. And importantly, we have a substantial growth opportunity in the UAE that will further diversify our portfolio and expand our brand into new markets. Turning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $271 million of adjusted property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, up 24% year-on-year on a very difficult comp. While F1 was clearly a contributor, activity of the property was intense throughout the quarter, with RevPAR table drop, slot handle and food and beverage revenue all well above what was a very strong quarter in 2022.', ""In fact, we had our best October, our best November, and our best December ever in terms of EBITDA during Q4. We continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas, and I'm incredibly proud of the Vegas team. More recently, January 2024 looked a lot like January 2023 from an overall revenue perspective with hotel revenue particularly strong. That being said, January isn't where the action is this quarter. It's all about February. Super Bowl, Chinese New Year and for us, the best February in our history for group and convention. Between Super Bowl and Chinese New Year, we have doubled the front money and credit that we had in 2023, and we expect record hotel revenue over Super Bowl. So a very active February will really set the tone for the first quarter."", 'Turning to Boston. Encore generated $64 million of EBITDAR during the quarter, similar to many other regional markets, demand at the property was largely stable year-on-year. Revenue decreased by about 0.5%, but the team has done a great job remaining disciplined on OpEx, driving a 2% year-over-year increase in EBITDAR. More recently, underlying demand has remained healthy through January although a couple of unfortunately timed winter storms had negatively impacted visitation during a few recent weekends. On the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we recently received a key environmental approval and we are advancing through a few remaining items before construction can begin. Turning to Macau. We generated $297 million of EBITDA in the quarter on market share that was consistent with the prior quarter and with 2019.', 'While we held in the normal range in mass, we held a bit high in VIP. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDA would have been approximately $290 million or 94% of Q4 2019 levels. The strength in our business there has continued into Q1. In the casino, our mass drop per day in January increased 32% versus January 2019 and was up sequentially versus Q4. On the non-gaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%, along with continued strength in tenant retail sales. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined OpEx control drove healthy margins during the month of January. On the development front, we opened our first major concession-related capital project during Q4, a collaboration with the team behind Las Vegas-based Illuminarium and initial customer feedback has been positive.', ""We are deep into design and planning for our other concession-related CapEx commitments, including our Destination Food Hall, the new event and entertainment center and a unique production show. Lastly, turning to Wynn Al Marjan, construction continues on the project with much of the hotel tower and podium foundation now complete, and we are nearly ready to start going vertical on the hotel tower. Property is really going to be a stunner, and it's great to see the buildings start to take shape. With that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter."", ""Julie Cameron-Doe: Thank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $270.8 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $696.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.9%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Higher than novel table games hold benefited EBITDA by around $10 million in Q4. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.4 million in Q4'23, up 16% year-over-year, well below the 19% increase in revenue. The sequential increase in OpEx was primarily driven by higher programming and staffing costs related to F1. Turning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $64.4 million on revenue of $217.1 million with an EBITDA margin of 29.7%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax of $1.14 million per day in Q4'23, down 2% year-over-year, driving a 70 basis point increase in EBITDA margin."", 'The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $297 million in the quarter on $910.6 million of operating revenues. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher-than-expected hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $7 million during the quarter. Importantly, mass hold at both properties within the expected range during the quarter with the hold impact primarily related to the VIP side of the business. EBITDA margin was 32.6% in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2019, driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies.', ""Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.56 million per day in Q4, a decrease of 14% compared to $3 million in Q4 2019. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover. In terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025. Moving on to the balance sheet."", 'Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.5 billion as of December 31. This was comprised of $2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2.45 billion in the US. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA in 2023. Together with our robust cash and liquidity position, creates a very healthy leverage and free cash flow profile for the company globally. Further, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on February 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of February 20, 2024. We also repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares, $139 million during the quarter, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.', 'We will consider additional dividend increases at Wynn Resorts and the initiation of the dividend from Wynn Macau as the recovery progresses and the exact timing of our global capital deployment plans become more clear. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $113 million, primarily related to the spa villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A.', 'See also 25 Cheap Safe English Speaking Countries For Americans and 20 Highest Quality Beers in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Aside from being a solid chunk in its own right, the deft move also saw their holding increase by some 28%.', ' View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', ""Notably, that recent purchase by Kirk Hachigian is the biggest insider purchase of NextEra Energy shares that we've seen in the last year. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$56.29 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices."", ""In the last twelve months NextEra Energy insiders were buying shares, but not selling.

Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders."", ""It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases.

Before I get started, I'd like to share with you that we have appointed Robin Zondervan as our incoming Vice President of Investor Relations.

I have full confidence that with Robin's leadership, we will continue to have a world-class investor relations function at Masco and provide the investment community with the information and transparency you have come to expect from us. Now on to our results. I'll start this morning with some brief comments on our fourth quarter and full year results, and I'll finish with our view on 2024 as well as our long-term margin expectations. Please turn to Slide 5. We delivered a strong finish to another dynamic and successful year. In the fourth quarter, our top line decreased 2% with volumes down across most categories, partially offset by favorable pricing, currency and our acquisition of Sauna360. The smaller decline in volume, relative to the first 3 quarters of the year, supports our view that many of our markets appear to be stabilizing. Operating profit increased $38 million in the quarter due to a favorable price/commodity relationship, as we continue to recover the significant inflation that we have experienced over the past 2 years and due to our continued efforts to drive efficiencies across our operations. Operating profit margin improved to 230 basis points to 14.5%. With our strong execution, our earnings per share for the quarter increased 28% to $0.83 per share. Turning to our segments. Plumbing sales were in line with the prior year in local currency, with lower volumes being offset by favorable pricing and our acquisition. Plumbing performance in the quarter was led by Delta Faucet's mid-single-digit sales growth, driven by strong performance in the wholesale channel. International plumbing performed better than expected in the fourth quarter as demand in Europe and China, while still challenged, appears to be stabilizing. Investments in our leading global plumbing brands, innovative products and customer service are producing results and we will continue to capitalize on these initiatives. Turning to our Decorative Architectural segment. Sales declined 7%, primarily due to a soft DIY paint market, with DIY paint sales declining high single digits. While our pro paint business declined slightly in the quarter, we are very pleased with our 3-year pro paint stacked comp of approximately 60%. This significant growth in share gain demonstrates the strength of our Behr brand and the quality of our products that continue to resonate with pro painters. We will continue to invest in this business to expand our services and build upon our successful collaboration with The Home Depot to capitalize on the large opportunity in the pro paint market. Now let's review our full year performance. Please turn to Slide 6. Masco executed extremely well in 2023 and improved nearly every operating metric for the full year. Gross margin improved 360 basis points to 35.2%. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 16.8%. Plumbing margin expanded 210 basis points to 18%. Decorative margin expanded 10 basis points to 17.8%. Earnings per share grew 2% to $3.86 per share, up from $3.77 per share in 2022. We delivered a return on invested capital of 36%, and our free cash flow conversion was approximately 122%, which allowed us to return $610 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2023, and to complete the bolt-on acquisition of Sauna360 for approximately $136 million. Importantly, we have achieved compound annual earnings per share growth of 14% from 2019 to 2023, delivering on our commitment of double-digit EPS growth through cycles and demonstrating the power of our brands, innovation and portfolio of lower-ticket repair- and remodel-oriented products. I want to thank all our employees for their strong execution, focus on the customer, and their continuous improvement mindset that delivered this tremendous performance. Turning to Slide 7. As we look to the future, we are well positioned to achieve strong profitable growth over the next few years through top line growth, market share gains, margin expansion and disciplined capital deployment. Our current market assumptions for 2024 are as follows: For the North American repair and remodel market, we expect the market to be flat to down low single digits. For our international markets, we expect the markets in aggregate to be down low to mid-single digits. For the paint market, we expect the DIY paint market to be down low single digits and the pro paint market to increase low single digits. We expect to outperform the market and for Masco's overall sales to be approximately flat in 2024. Despite this flat top line assumption, we will continue to improve margins through disciplined pricing, selective cost reductions, innovative product introductions and operational efficiencies across our business. This margin expansion will not be without its challenges. As freight and shipping costs have recently increased, other commodity inputs remain elevated and other costs, such as people-related expenses and insurance, are increasing. We are up for the challenge and have demonstrated our ability to execute in dynamic times. We expect to deliver increased plumbing margins of approximately 18.5%, and decorative margins of approximately 18% in 2024, resulting in a Masco operating margin of approximately 17%. Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains unchanged. Firstly, we will reinvest in our business to maintain and grow our leadership positions and win in the marketplace. This includes continuing to invest in our growth initiatives such as: growing our share in the domestic plumbing wholesale channel; continuing to expand our international plumbing share; and continuing to gain share in pro paint. It also includes investing in our facilities to ensure we have the capacity to support future growth by completing our European faucet and shower facility and our Midwestern paint manufacturing and distribution center. Secondly, our capital allocation strategy is to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet with gross debt to EBITDA levels of below 2.5x. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with gross debt to EBITDA of 2x at year-end. Thirdly, we have a targeted dividend payout ratio of 30%. I'm pleased to share that our Board declared a 2% increase in our dividend for 2024, which will bring our annual dividend to $1.16 per share and marks the 11th consecutive annual increase. And fourth and finally, we expect strong free cash flow conversion in 2024 of approximately 90%, and we'll deploy that free cash flow after dividends to share repurchases or acquisitions. Based on our projected free cash flow, we expect to deploy approximately $600 million to share repurchases or acquisitions in 2024. Our M&A strategy has not changed. We continue to review and selectively pursue opportunities that have the right strategic fit and the right return for Masco, with the goal of adding 1% to 3% top line growth through acquisitions annually. Based on our expected operating performance and capital deployment actions, we anticipate earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $4 to $4.25 per share. Now looking out over the next 3 years. We will continue our strong execution and deliver margin expansion through 2026. For our plumbing segment, with our industry-leading brands, including Delta and Hansgrohe, we expect to expand margins to 20% in 2026, up from 18% in 2023. For our decorative segment, led by our industry-leading Behr brand, we expect to achieve margins of 19% to 20% in 2026, up from 17.8% in 2023. This would result in overall Masco operating profit margins of approximately 18.5% in 2026. We believe we can achieve these margins with normalized 3% to 5% repair and remodel industry growth in '25 and '26 through leveraging incremental volume, exercising pricing discipline and executing operational improvements. While 2023 clearly saw a reduction in demand, we believe that our markets will stabilize in 2024 and return to typical growth rates in 2025 and 2026. Structural factors are supportive of increased repair and remodel activity in several ways. Many homeowners have taken advantage of low mortgage rates and are likely to remain in their homes longer. 1.7 million more homes will reach the prime remodeling ages of 20 to 39 years old over the next 3 years and home equity levels remain high. All of these structural forces provide tailwinds for our business and increase our confidence for a strong repair and remodel market. We will continue to invest in our brands, capabilities and people to outperform the competition in both the near and long term. With favorable fundamentals and our continued focus on executing our growth strategy, together with our strong free cash flow and capital deployment, Masco is well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value over the long term. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick to go over our fourth quarter, full year and 2024 outlook in more detail. Rick?"", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. As many of you know, I joined Masco as the CFO in mid-October. I'm excited to be part of this strong performing company and team and I'm happy to be sharing our results with you this morning. As Renee mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization charges and other onetime items. Turning to Slide 9. Sales in the quarter decreased 2%, or 3% excluding favorable currency impact. In local currency, North American sales decreased 3%, or 4% excluding acquisitions. In local currency, international sales decreased 3%. We continue to drive operational efficiency and price/cost performance in the quarter, which helped lead to gross margin expansion of 560 basis points to 35.1%. SG&A as a percent of sales was 20.6% and was impacted by higher employee-related costs such as incentive compensation. Our operating profit grew 16% in the quarter, and margin expanded 230 basis points to 14.5%. This strong operating profit and margin performance was due to pricing actions, lower commodity and freight costs and cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by lower volume and higher employee-related expenses. This resulted in EPS growth of 28% to $0.83 per share. Turning to the full year 2023. Sales decreased 8% over the prior year, slightly better than our expectations given sales performance in our plumbing segment. FX and acquisitions did not have a material impact on full year results. In local currency, North American sales decreased 9% and international sales decreased 6%. SG&A as a percent of sales was 18.4%, in line with more normalized levels. Operating profit for the full year was $1.3 billion, and operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 16.8%. Lastly, our EPS increased 2% year-over-year to $3.86. This figure assumes a tax rate of 24.5% versus the previously guided 24% which unfavorably impacted full year EPS by $0.03. Turning to Slide 10. Plumbing sales in the fourth quarter increased 1% and showed signs of stabilization. Lower volume and mix decreased sales by 4%. This was more than offset by favorable pricing of 2%, the impact of acquisitions of 2% and FX of 1%. In local currency, North American plumbing sales increased 1%, however, decreased 1% excluding acquisitions. In local currency, international plumbing sales decreased 3% as demand continued to be soft in Europe and in China. Segment operating profit in the fourth quarter was up $50 million or 34% year-over-year and operating margin expanded 400 basis points to 16.4%. This operating profit improvement was driven by pricing actions, lower commodity and freight costs and cost-savings initiatives partially offset by lower volume and higher employee-related expenses. Turning to the full year 2023. Plumbing sales decreased 8%, slightly better than our expectations. Lower volume and mix decreased sales by 12%, partially offset by net pricing, which favorably impacted sales by 4%. Acquisitions had a favorable impact of 1% and FX was immaterial for the full year. In local currency, North American plumbing sales decreased 8%, net of the 1% impact from acquisitions and international plumbing sales decreased 6%. Full year operating profit increased 4% and margin expanded 210 basis points to 18%. Turning to Slide 11. Decorative Architectural sales decreased 7% for the fourth quarter. Paint sales declined mid-single digits, with pro paint sales down slightly against a mid-single-digit comp in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating profit was $100 million, in line with 2022 performance and operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.8%. Operating profit was impacted by lower volumes and pricing, offset by cost-savings initiatives and lower material costs. As expected, we did experience relief in certain paint input costs, with modest low single-digit deflation in the fourth quarter. Turning to the full year 2023. Sales decreased 9%, driven by a high single-digit decline in our DIY paint business and a mid-single-digit decline in our pro paint business. This performance was in line with the expectations we set at the beginning of 2023, as we cycled over 25% pro paint growth in 2022. Additionally, over a 3-year period, pro paint sales have grown by over 60%, demonstrating our ability to gain and retain share. Full year operating income was $557 million in the segment and operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 17.8%. Turning to Slide 12. Our year-end balance sheet was strong with gross debt-to-EBITDA at 2x. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of liquidity, including cash and availability under our revolving credit facility. Working capital improved by 6 days to 59 days or 16% of sales. With this improvement in working capital, our adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, an improvement of over $500 million compared to the prior year, driving our free cash flow conversion to 122%. Given our strong cash performance, we were able to return $610 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the repurchase of $227 million of stock in the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and review our outlook for 2024. For Masco overall, we expect 2024 sales to be flat, but with operating margin growing to approximately 17%. Currency is projected to have minimal impact in our 2024 results. We will continue to invest in our business for future growth while also maintaining cost discipline. As a result, we expect SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the range of 18% to 18.5% in 2024. As always, we will take appropriate actions to address our costs as the year develops based on market conditions. As we think about the cadence for the year, we expect sales to be down slightly in the first half of the year, with modest growth in the back half of the year. Also, as it relates to operating margins, with a softer sales outlook in the first half of the year, we anticipate Masco margins will be roughly flat in the first half of the year, with the expansion expected in the second half. In our plumbing segment, we expect 2024 full year sales to be plus or minus low single digits. We anticipate the full year plumbing margin will be approximately 18.5%, up from our 2023 margin of 18%. Margin expansion will primarily be driven by pricing discipline, operational efficiency and continued cost-savings initiatives. In our Decorative Architectural segment, we expect 2024 sales to also be plus or minus low single digits. Looking specifically at our paint business in 2024, we anticipate our DIY business to decrease low single digits and our pro paint business to increase low single digits. We anticipate the full year Decorative Architectural margin to be approximately 18%, up from our 2023 margin of 17.8%, driven by cost-savings initiatives. With regards to capital allocation, we expect to reinvest approximately $200 million through capital expenditures, pay a dividend of $0.29 per share per quarter and deploy approximately $600 million towards share repurchases or acquisitions in 2024. Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, our 2024 EPS estimate is $4 to $4.25. This assumes a 221 million average diluted share count for the year and a 24.5% effective tax rate, which is consistent with our 2023 effective tax rate. Additional financial assumptions for 2024 can be found on Slide 16 of our earnings deck. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Lovallo.', 'John Lovallo', ""The first one is your R&R is expected to be flat to slightly down in 2024. It seems like you expect flattish sales for both plumbing and Decorative Architectural. So seemingly, basically in line, maybe slightly above the overall market. How are you thinking about Masco's ability to outgrow its markets longer term?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""John, thanks for the question. I haven't changed my opinion on our ability to gain share, which is that we expect as a company to both outperform the market and to expand margins, and we expect to continue to do that. So we will outperform the market. And that's driven primarily by our brands which have developed over the years, as you know, to be leaders in their spaces. So there is both consumer pull as well as trade pull where we're well recognized by plumbers and pro painters as a quality brand, our service proposition as it relates to our channel partners to be able to help them drive profitable growth with minimal inventory positions due to our repeatable delivery and service, and our people and our teams around the globe. So our expectation is to outperform the market. Now, in some spaces that we compete with, there'll be greater share gain. In other spaces where we already have substantial leading market share, those share gains will be more modest, but we definitely expect to outperform the market going forward."", 'John Lovallo', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just help us with the cadence of the planned margin expansion across plumbing and Decorative Architectural to your 2026 targets. I mean, is the improvement expected to be fairly linear in 2025 and 2026 or how should we think about that?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Well, I think if you -- 2024, we believe is going to be flattish on the top line and probably more modest as it relates to margin improvements. And when you think about -- when we think about our innovation pipeline and our projects that will drive efficiency and cost reductions, which will lead to that margin improvement, those happen more towards the out-years and it will take some time to settle in and to be realized into the P&L. So I would say there's a bit of that margin acceleration in '25 and '26. Primarily, when you think about it, John, the biggest driver is the -- will be the drop-down on incremental revenue. And we have very strong, let's call it, 25% in plumbing, it's knocking on 30% drop-down on the incremental volume. And our plan, as we've said, is to -- our belief is that we'll be relatively flat in '24 and then in '25 and '26, when we think about the health of the consumer when we see what's happening and believe what will continue to happen with regards to stabilization as it relates to rates, et cetera, that we're expecting more of a typical growth rates in '25 to '26, call it, in that 3% to 5% growth in R&R. Now there's -- we look at the same analytics and we listen to a lot of the same people as it relates to analytics around expectations, and a lot are calling for significantly more than that. We're not. We're just basing our '25 and '26 on more of a historical 3% to 5% R&R growth rate. So that will be a significant contributor to margin expansion as well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Matthew Bouley from Barclays.', 'Matthew Adrien Bouley', ""On that margin cadence into '24, looking at the past 3 quarters, your year-over-year margins have expanded, right, actually kind of improved the past 3 quarters. And it sounded like you're saying that, that kind of margin expansion will flatten in the first half and then go back to expanding in the second half. So I'm just curious if you can kind of touch on that a little bit. Sort of why wouldn't the recent improvements in margins kind of continue to flow through on a year-over-year basis into the first half of '24?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Matt, I think when you think about the improvement rate that we've seen this year, we've had some pricing catch-up that we had to do against some -- as you know, a fairly significant cost inflation. So that was a component of it. When we think about '24, we have operational improvements that we're going to continue to drive. Probably when we think about the benefit of pricing, we'll see I would say a little bit of a headwind in our paint business. And we've talked consistently about our relationship with our channel partner as it relates to price where we keep our operating income dollars whole and match commodities with price, but that affects margin and it affects it both ways where you go up or go down. So there'll be a slight headwind in pricing in our decorative business and probably a slight tailwind in our plumbing business. So to your direct question in terms of the rate of margin improvement, I think it really -- that really points to -- really answers your question as it relates to pricing and where we will see margin improvement despite calling for a flat top line in '24 is in the efficiency improvements that we're going to continue to drive with our projects that we have in flight."", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Yes, Matt, the only thing I would add is from a timing perspective, our margin performance is going to be aligned in terms of the expansion in line with our sales growth. And as we indicated, we expect a bit softer in the first half of 2024. As growth starts to pick up, we believe, in the second half of the year, we'll get that drop-down that Keith referred to. And then as we roll into '25 and '26, as growth returns to more normalized levels, that drop-down impact in terms of margin expansion, we'll see that manifest itself more prominently."", 'Matthew Adrien Bouley', ""Got it. Really helpful. And then second one, just actually kind of coming off that last point there, Rick. The cadence to the top line in '24, obviously, there's been a lot of volatility in R&R end markets, probably more recently year-to-date, maybe some noise around weather and all that. Can you just kind of put a finer point around that early 2024 expectation? How are -- how is demand tracking year-to-date? Any kind of color on some of the volatility or improvement as you get into Q2 and beyond?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Matt, in terms of the year-to-date demand -- or the current demand, I'd characterize it as stabilizing. We've -- I would say, in terms of what was favorable to our expectation in '23 was a combination of both our execution, the timing and impact of our cost-reduction projects or solid pricing, et cetera. And then also a little bit better demand than we anticipated. Certainly, some volatility out there, but we're seeing signs of stabilization. Had a nice quarter in wholesale plumbing as it relates to top line demand. While still challenged, certainly, in Europe, we have seen some stabilization and starting to see some positive signs coming out of China as well. So that's how I'd characterize the demand in general."", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Yes. And it's -- what I would say is it's in line with what our guidance is indicating. So there's nothing inconsistent with that, which is we do expect some stabilization, as Keith mentioned, but a bit softer. So down slightly in the first half of the year. That's kind of what we're seeing in the markets today, but we are seeing some stabilization globally."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Kim', ""Appreciate all the info here. Could you talk a little bit more about the trends you're seeing in hardware and lighting within the dec arc business and how that figures into your fiscal '24 guide and maybe also your long-term margin targets for dec arc?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""These businesses were impacted by market softness in 2023. No question about it. We've talked consistently about it. Both businesses, and I'm talking about our lighting and hardware business, Kichler and Liberty took pricing and cost actions to offset the inflation they experienced, partially offset the volume loss in '23. In '24, I'd expect these businesses to perform more in line with how we're seeing the overall R&R market, which is flat to down low single digits. Did you have a second question there, Stephen?"", 'Stephen Kim', ""Yes. Well, within the hardware and lighting, no, that was pretty much what I was looking for. And then as I think more broadly about your guide for next year, I think Matt touched on it, but I just wanted to take a finer point. Are you saying -- could we see sales and margins on a year-over-year basis be down in 1Q? Or is that not what you're envisioning?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""They could be. I'm thinking more kind of flat to maybe slightly down in 1Q, first half and then better performance both in sales and margin in the second half."", 'Stephen Kim', ""Okay. That's very helpful. Yes, appreciate it."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.', 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""It's Mike Rehaut. I wanted to kind of first ask about the '26 targets. Appreciate the kind of laying some of those out. And thinking about the margins, I think, Keith, you kind of laid out a framework of in '25 and '26, getting to those targets, kind of thinking about a sales growth backdrop of 3% to 5%. So just want to make sure that I'm understanding that the margin expansion off of '24, how much of that would be driven by volume leverage or incremental margins off of the volume leverage as opposed to perhaps other initiatives around either productivity or discrete cost-efficiency measures around manufacturing or SG&A, et cetera?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Yes. Our margin improvement expectations, and frankly, the history of it, has been driven by a basket of initiatives that we drive. Certainly, there's the incremental margin improvement that comes from incremental volumes. So that drops down at, call it, 25% to 30%. That's certainly above our fleet average of the company. So that's the significant driver in our margin expansion. But it's also part of the benefits of our continued investments in innovation. So we have an innovation pipeline and an expectation over those years to be launching margin-accretive products and products that both contribute to our market outperformance on the top line as well as margin improvements. Very excited about the momentum we have in terms of the Masco operating system and what that's been able to produce in terms of leverage in our factories, in terms of variable overhead in addition to the new product launches and our brand building, in addition to the benefit of the top line, that gives us also pricing power, and we're confident in that in being able to have that be a contributor to margin expansion as well. So the big driver would be the drop-down in the incremental volumes, but we also have a pipeline and defined initiatives around labor productivity, variable cost productivity, et cetera, to drive the margin expansion."", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Yes. And Mike, the only thing I would add to that is, as Keith mentioned, the big driver is the drop-down on the volume. But as we're growing, as we're introducing new products and then getting the price for that from innovation, just to continue to stay disciplined on price and disciplined on cost. So as we grow, we do see that 25% to 30% drop-down. So although pricing and cost initiatives may not be as significant of a contributor, they will contribute both directly as well as indirectly in terms of continuing to leverage that incremental drop-down."", 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""Okay. No, no, no, that's helpful color. I appreciate it. I guess maybe secondly, kind of staying on this topic for a moment. You look at the decorative margins, on average between 2015 and 2021, the segment averaged 19.5%, 19.4%. So it kind of seems like you're getting back to that midpoint, whereas maybe plumbing, you're getting a little bit above that, which kind of more speaks, I think, to the volume leverage. So just wanted to kind of make sure I'm thinking about this right in that is it -- is the right way to think about this is that the operating leverage, the incremental margins, much more so comes through on the plumbing side over the next couple of years, whereas decorative, it kind of seems like it's kind of getting back to that historical gross margin and maybe there's some perhaps even deflation that is a margin benefit over the next couple of years as more recently, when you had an inflationary environment, that was margin dilutive?Just trying to think about kind of returning to that historical average and what's assumed in the decorative. Because if I'm thinking about this right, it does seem like the incremental margins on sales leverage more so apply to plumbing than decorative. And love any thoughts on that, if I'm not thinking about it the way you are."", 'Keith J. Allman', ""No, I think, simply said, you got it. I think that's right. We have higher drop-down on incremental margins in plumbing, a little bit lower, call it, in the 25% range in deco. In deco, specifically thinking about paint, we have a different pricing dynamic, which we've talked about. I won't get into the details on that. But no, I think you've got it right, Mike."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.', 'Anthony James Pettinari', 'Can you discuss price/cost spread in plumbing and DA in 4Q? And maybe any updated expectations around Brass carryover? And then just thinking about COGS maybe more holistically, what level of cost inflation does the full year guidance contemplate?', 'Keith J. Allman', ""Yes, Tony, thanks for the question. So from a Q4 perspective, we saw -- we did see some favorable pricing, kind of low single digits in the plumbing, both for the quarter and for the calendar year. For DAP, it was a lot more muted. And as we look into 2024, we're expecting in the plumbing segment, kind of low single-digit pricing as a tailwind. But for the Decorative Architectural products, we're expecting a bit of a headwind from a pricing perspective, kind of modest price giveback."", 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then this is maybe just a minor point, but in terms of the DA margin target in '26 being a range versus plumbing and company targets, single points, is that the pricing mechanism you discussed or just any background there?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""I think just we'll give point estimates and range estimates in terms of our guidance and this we felt a little more appropriate just given some of the uncertainty. As I think Mike articulated, we've got a little bit more of a drop-down dynamic in terms of the volume dropping down the margins on plumbing. And so we felt pretty confident with regards to our 20% margin target in 2026. On decorative, we just have a range of 19% to 20%. And as Mike pointed out, it's more consistent with kind of where we ranged historically."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.', 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""My first question is thinking about the macro and what that could imply for the business this year. There's increasingly an expectation that rates will move down as we get later into the spring and the summer. And as we think about that perhaps driving that existing home sales coming back, how should we think about the timing of those events relative to how you could start to see that coming through in the business? And what are the segments that could be most benefited by that?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Susan, when you think about the correlation to our top line drivers, existing home sales is certainly an important factor but not nearly as important as really how the consumer feels and how the consumer confidence is developing, that confidence driven by the amount of equity in their home, for example. So if you think about, let's say, the existing home turnover, pick a number, say it's, let's call it, 5 million. So if we have 5 million units turnover, that's on a 130 million unit base. So roughly, what is that? 3%. And we know or we estimate that a newly purchased home in that year will spend approximately 30% more on home improvement. So if you take 3%-ish spending 30% more, you start to see how that minimizes the impact of that. Or said differently, if we -- for every $1 million of existing home turnover increase, it only drives a couple 0.1% of overall top line volume in the market. So a 25% increase in existing home turnover drives 0.2% in the overall market roughly. So it's important to us and particularly when you look at something like DIY paint that tends to be a little bit more sensitive to existing home sales. But more important, I think when you -- is the correlation to R&R spend as it relates to home price appreciation and consumer confidence. So as rates decrease and the consumer becomes more confident, that's really a driver of what we think will really be pushing the R&R market."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then shifting to the working capital, you made a lot of really impressive progress there over the last year. As you think about '24 and just the go forward, what's the ability to continue to drive benefits from that? And anything you'd highlight there?"", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Yes, Sue, it's Rick. Yes, so I appreciate the question. As you noted, we did, as a business unit, really across the business, drive working capital efficiencies and improvement. We brought it back down to 16% of sales in 2023, which is more in line with historical levels. And it really was a big contributor to our cash flow in 2023, generated over -- it contributed over $200 million in terms of cash flow in terms of our free cash flow number, which was very beneficial. I think going forward, we plan to really hold working capital in a disciplined manner, make sure we've got enough inventory to keep up our service levels, which are important from our customer perspective, but to stay disciplined on that. And our guidance for 2024 is that we'd have working capital as a percent of sales of 16.5%, so a modest increase. But we'll calibrate that based off of the timing of when the market comes back and starts to grow. But we'll as a business stay disciplined now that we've got the working capital kind of back to where we like it to be."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', 'Okay. And good luck with everything.', 'Keith J. Allman', 'Thanks, Sue.', 'Richard Westenberg', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.', 'Adam Michael Baumgarten', ""I believe you mentioned on the call that paint pricing is lower in '23. I guess a couple of questions. One, when did that occur throughout the year? And is the outlook for '24 that you mentioned, down based on just the carryover maybe from some of the movements in '23? Or do you expect incremental pricing pressure beyond kind of what you maybe recently saw?"", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Yes, Adam, maybe just to clarify, for the calendar year 2023, we saw very modest price increase. It actually corresponded with commodities. So we saw material costs down in Q4 in the paint sector. But for the full year, we saw appreciation overall. And so we saw a slight price increase in terms of the 2023 numbers. As we look into 2024, as I indicated, as we indicated, we do see some price-downs in 2024. And that's really a reflection of what we expect to see, which is kind of modest low single-digit deflation in the inputs. So kind of keeping that price/cost relationship in check."", 'Keith J. Allman', ""To your point, Adam, there would be some carryover obviously with it being a little bit -- the price give-back a little bit later in '23."", 'Adam Michael Baumgarten', ""Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess for you, Rick, now that you've been at Masco for, I believe it's almost 4 months now. Where do you see the biggest opportunities for Masco from a cost side going forward?"", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Yes, appreciate the question. And yes, as I mentioned, first of all, as I mentioned in my opening comments, really excited to be part of the Masco team and the strong business and operations and portfolio that we have. I'm really excited about the portfolio of brands and products in the business. I've had the opportunity to really get out and meet all of the business unit leaders. And I've been out to many of the business units. I was actually in Germany at Hansgrohe last week, really impressed with the team and really impressed with the mindset in terms of the Masco operating system and the mindset of continuous improvement, operational efficiency and cost reduction. So I think we need to continue to kind of exercise ourselves in that regard. I think with regards to opportunities, it's really leveraging the mindset that we have here at Masco and across the business units as well as leveraging our scale as we continue to grow the business and drive that productivity and that efficiency really across all of our business, but particularly on the plumbing side as we look at our global business."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Michael Glaser Dahl', ""I wanted to ask again about cost. I think the question was asked earlier around price/cost spread, and I heard the comments around price. I didn't hear, specifically, your expectations for input costs for both segments that are embedded within the '24 guidance. So could you address that, please?"", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Sure, Mike. I'm happy to do that. So as it pertains to 2024, we're expecting for input costs not to be a material impact, not to be significant in 2024. Obviously, we'll see how the year plays out. In plumbing specifically, we will see -- we expect to see some modest decline in input costs but offset with some freight and some other inflation. Obviously, as I think we'd all know, given the dynamics in the Red Sea, freight cost is a little bit volatile, and there's a bit of a headwind in the first half that's baked into our outlook that's a contributor to our expectations in the first half of the year. But that's a little bit the dynamic on plumbing. In terms of Decorative Architectural products, I think we mentioned a couple of times, we expect relatively modest input cost decrease in 2024."", 'Keith J. Allman', ""We're thinking -- Mike, we're thinking -- specifically, we're thinking in plumbing, relatively flat commodities, sort of staying where they are now. And for pain inputs, while they've moderated sequentially when you look at resins, we are seeing a little bit of deflation in those input costs. But other costs, including copper, zinc, TiO2, they've moderated more and they will moderate a little bit more, but not significant benefit."", 'Michael Glaser Dahl', ""Got it. Okay. And then my second question, just back on the free cash flow. The conversion rate, obviously, 90% is still high. I think your business typically targets 100% conversion on net income. When I look at the moving pieces, it doesn't seem like working cap is that much of an incremental usage. And then you've got CapEx, I think, down year-on-year. So just any other drivers in terms of things we should be thinking about, level of investments or non-working cap line items? Any other moving pieces there?"", 'Richard Westenberg', ""So Mike, those are the 2 really. So working capital, as I think Sue had asked in terms of that dynamic, we do expect a little bit of build in working capital in 2024. We'll watch that, obviously. But we've got it down to a pretty balanced level right now. So as the market returns, we expect some build in working capital. Capital expenditures, as you noted, will be down year-over-year from '23 to '24, but it's still higher than our depreciation and amortization. So our CapEx guidance for 2024 is $200 million. Our D&A is $160 million. So that CapEx versus D&A is another contributor to the 90% guide."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research.', 'Truman Andrew Patterson', ""Rick, looking forward to working with you going forward. First question for me. In your plumbing segment, your supply chain's heavily relying on shipping products to the U.S. and Europe. I'm hoping you can give an update on some of the Red Sea shipping issues currently. Any supply chain issues or incremental costs embedded in your '24 guidance?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""We are seeing, as you might expect, Truman, elevated costs for the containers that normally would be routed to the Red Sea that now have to go around. And you're exactly right; it's primarily for our European business. So those container costs have increased, and we've contemplated that in our guide. And that's all part and parcel of how we think next year is going to shake out, but we are seeing an increase in those costs."", 'Richard Westenberg', ""Truman, to your other question, although we're seeing elevated costs, so far, service levels have been able to be retained. And so we're not having disruptions per se, but we're watching, obviously, the dynamics closely."", 'Truman Andrew Patterson', ""Okay. Got you. And just thinking through your '24 revenue guidance of flattish versus a flat to down low single-digit R&R market. First, are you all expecting kind of your smaller ticket portfolio to outperform big ticket? And then second, you all mentioned some incremental market share gains this year specifically. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit, product categories, geographies, channels, et cetera, some of these kind of near-term gains?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""We do think that how we have repositioned our portfolio, Truman, to be the lower-priced, lower-ticket repair and remodel focus is more resilient than the higher-priced, higher-ticket items that are oftentimes more associated with new construction. So when you compare our type of project that a consumer would execute with paint, plumbing, lighting, hardware, et cetera, those tend to be more resilient than the bigger tickets, say, cabinets and windows which I'm very familiar with. So yes, we think that is -- that bodes well. And that fits in with the strategy and how we aim to be attractive and who we aim to be attractive to as it relates to investors. As it relates to a higher margin, more resilient, less cyclical portfolio. And that's really important to us. And we've demonstrated, as we said, the ability to meet our commitment of double-digit EPS growth through cycles when you look at 14% EPS CAGR from '19 through to where we are today, so 2023. So we're very pleased with that, and we think that is part of -- partly driven -- more than partly driven by the reconfiguration of our portfolio. So that's a significant part of it. Reminding me your second question, Truman, the second into that?"", 'Truman Andrew Patterson', ""Yes, just the near-term kind of market share gains that's embedded in your guidance. Just hoping you could elaborate on kind of product categories, geographies, channels, et cetera."", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Sure. We're going to continue to invest in our share gains and continue to outperform the market as we have up to 2023. To highlight a few of those. We're particularly focused on the showroom channel in plumbing, and that involves our channel relationships with and our programs to drive growth. Our innovation pipeline is certainly a part of that brand and the pull that we have, as I mentioned before, both from the trade and the consumers as part of that. We've invested extensively in evolving showroom associates and creating advocacy in the showroom market. So it's not just about products, it's also about capturing the hearts and minds of the folks in the showroom that sell our products as it relates to involving them literally in the design of our products. And we treat that as an operational type of exercise for us to create advocacy. We measure it and we drive it. Certainly, pro paint. When you look at our pro paint, Truman, on a stacked basis over the last 3 years, we've driven 60% growth, 6-0. And I know a year, 1.5 years ago, there was a lot of questions on the stickiness of that demand. And we've proven that we're not only able to maintain those share gains but also intend to grow those share gains. And that's through service, through having the right product in the can, obviously, but through our overall competitiveness as it relates to as applied cost and jobs. We look at our Net Promoter Scores that we're clocking on our new and existing pro paint customers, and it's industry leading. So we feel really good about that. So there's a couple of areas there, plumbing wholesale, pro paint, but we're really driving across the board an expectation of market outperformance and margin expansion."", 'Truman Andrew Patterson', ""Great. And good luck in '24."", 'Keith J. Allman', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.', 'Garik Simha Shmois', ""First question is just on the 2026 margin targets. I was wondering if you could speak to maybe some of the levers you can pull more on the cost side if the remodeling market doesn't say, recover to that 3% to 5% expected range."", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Variable cost productivity, making sure that we're matching our shifts and our operating plan to the volume that we've had. Very hard to do. We've gotten very good at that for obvious reasons in the last couple years with the volatility we've seen. Depending on where the overall market goes, there's fixed cost productivity that we would drive. We continue, as Rick mentioned, to be disciplined in both price as -- disciplined in terms of both price as well as our ability to manage costs and to make sure that we are continuing to invest in those key areas that drive growth and nothing more. So cost maintenance, variable cost productivity, direct labor productivity, matching our fixed footprint to actual demand. All those sorts of things are part of our Masco operating system. And it's what we're measured on and what our teams across the company are compensated on in terms of the ultimate metric of how we perform is our ability to do that. So it's about all those disciplines together. There's no 1 silver bullet, but we will hit those margin commitments in 2026. And just like we have hit our double-digit earnings per growth commitment through cycles. And we've -- I believe we've -- that's something I value and we, as a company, value very much is the hard-earned credibility that we've developed with the investment community and our high say-do ratio."", 'Garik Simha Shmois', ""No, understood. Wanted to follow up just on 1 of the bigger ticket item, big businesses that you offer. You cited that bigger ticket is likely to remain more volatile or perhaps underperform smaller ticket. And just wondering about the spa business, what you're assuming for that in 2024. Maybe if we exclude the Sauna360 deal, like what are you expecting on an organic basis?"", 'Keith J. Allman', ""Yes. I like our spa business. It's a strong business with global market share. It's one of -- on a percentage, one of our more global businesses, I like the tailwinds behind it as it relates to the overlay with an aging population and the importance placed on mental and physical health, and we have a tremendous team there who are going to continue to drive market share. And the business is growing and doing a fine job. I'm not going to get into the specifics of how we parse out within the segment where it's growing. But I like that business, and we're going to continue to invest in it. We have a great product offering that's recently launched that's performing well for us. We have industry-leading technology that make those devices very easy to use and monitor and interface with. And as I said, it's outstanding team out there. So that business is going to continue to perform very well for us in '24 and beyond."", 'Renee Benedict', ""We'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning and for your interest in Masco. That concludes today's call. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.""]"

The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), which supplies data to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), is projecting 13.1% growth in semiconductors this year on the back of a 40% jump in memory demand.', 'Discrete, sensors, analog, logic and micro are also expected to grow, albeit at single-digit percentage rates. While growth will be across geographies, the Americas and Asia will post strong double-digit growth.', 'For the Analog/mixed signal group, the going is likely to be less smooth. That’s because many of these players have increased their exposure to auto and industrial markets, where design wins have more shelf life. These end markets are pulling the industry down notwithstanding the fact that growth prospects over the next 5-10 years remain excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.The fourth quarter was likely the bottom for his industry, according to market research firms. Macro-related uncertainties remain, however, limiting growth. Semtech stock looks good right now, and Macom Technology and Magnachip Semiconductor could also be worth keeping an eye on.', 'The electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.', 'The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.', 'The semiconductor market is expected to return to growth this year. Gartner estimates that growth will be 16.8% in 2024, as memory comes off a very bad 2023 amid weak demand that led to an inventory glut. With memory bouncing 66.3%, that situation will turn around. The analog/mixed signal market is also expected to grow, and end-market demand reflects this. PCs have been weak for a while now (Gartner expects return to growth in 2024, as inventory is worked down in the fourth quarter. IDC agrees, citing a PC refresh cycle - there’s the possibility of commercial refresh stretching out to 2025 when Windows 10 support ends - and AI integration. However, the expected 3.4% growth in 2024 implies that units won’t surpass pre-pandemic levels until the following year, attributed to macro concerns leading to softer business PC demand and some consumer inventory built in the fourth quarter in anticipation of imminent cost escalation.) Smartphone growth is not expected to be like before (3.8% growth in 2024 and 1.4% CAGR for the next five years, with inventories normalizing and mainly driven by stronger pricing and recovery in China, according to IDC). Inventory adjustments are also impacting the industrial market, with macro-related uncertainty continuing. Other markets like automotive, IoT, cloud and AI are better off. AI in particular is a boom market as of now. According to Gartner, only 5% of companies were using generative AI in 2023, which will grow to 80% by 2026. AI semiconductors will be 20% of total semiconductor sales by 2027, estimates Statista (as quoted in Nikkei). Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation, and sustainability considerations are secular drivers. Uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.', 'Certain key end markets for analog/mixed signal chips are headed down this year. First among them is the automotive market. The pandemic-related surge has more or less run its course. A weak macro situation, high interest rates, soft consumer sentiment and escalating geopolitical tensions are also not conducive. As a result, the outlook is not great for this market, according to S&P Global Ratings. That said, EVs should benefit from new models and government subsidies, although the number of players in this market seems to indicate that some will have to be pushed out for the others to succeed. As far as the industrial market is concerned, there is a difference of opinion. The ISM data indicates that manufacturing contracted again in January and has been contracting for more than a year. According to S&P Global, it has been a roller coaster ride, with sharp increases and decreases over the past year. Both agree that significant uncertainty remains in the manufacturing sector.', '·The industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. If the weakness persists, semiconductor manufacturers will be driven to cut production, thus lowering utilization rates. At the same time, new fab construction, often supported by government initiatives, and their equipping remains in full swing, which brings additional capacity online. This does not look good for pricing.', 'An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didn’t have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. That’s because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As the importance of semiconductors in defense grows, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not from a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs.', 'The Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?"", 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Thank you, Mark. 2023 was an exciting year for S&P Global, a year of innovation and growth. Our results in 2023 serve as a testament to strong execution and S&P Global's unique position at the center of the global markets. Excluding Engineering Solutions, which was divested in the second quarter of last year, revenue increased 8% year-over-year. We expanded adjusted operating margins by almost 300 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter to finish the year with approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion. And we surpassed our $600 million target for cost synergies by $19 million. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 13% to come in at the high end of our guidance range as we continued to benefit from strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management and a commitment to strong capital returns. On the topic of capital returns, 2023 marked the 50th consecutive year that S&P Global has increased its cash dividend. And we've already announced the Board approval to make 2024 the 51st. In 2023, we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, representing more than 100% of our adjusted free cash flow. In addition to strong financial performance, we created a formal artificial intelligence leadership team in 2023, which we'll discuss in more detail shortly. We also delivered double-digit growth and significant innovation in key strategic investment areas. Private Market Solutions and Sustainability & Energy Transition both delivered double-digit growth in 2023. And we're well positioned to continue growing in these important areas in 2024. Our Vitality Index, which we target to remain at or above 10% of company revenue, actually exceeded 11% in 2023 and also increased at a double-digit rate. In 2023, we delivered key wins in each of the five strategic pillars we introduced at the end of 2022. We look forward to accelerating that success in 2024 and continuing our track record of creating value for our customers and our shareholders. We know that our success depends on creating value for our customers, and we delivered for them in 2023. We improved customer retention rates in several of our divisions last year while continuing to introduce new products and features more quickly and more frequently. Through deep engagement with customers around the world, tens of thousands of customer touch points, we saw continued adoption of enterprise contracts in Market Intelligence and acceleration of enterprise agreements in Commodity Insights. We know that certain customer verticals, particularly financial services and regional banks, had unique challenges in 2023. While we discussed longer sales cycles through 2023, we were able to keep our sales pipeline moving and continued to demonstrate value for our customers even in challenging times. As we look to 2024, we continue to see macroeconomic market and geopolitical challenges. Our customers need unique and differentiated datasets and key insights for the markets they serve, which means our role as a trusted and strategic partner is more important than ever. Now nearly 2 years after the merger, we've put the work of operational integration behind us, and we have fully turned to the exciting work of growth, innovation and execution. We remain committed to balancing margin expansion with strategic initiatives and long-term growth. We will also look for ways to optimize our portfolio of products and services. With the merger integration behind us, we plan to continue reviewing and optimizing our portfolio of assets to meet our customers' needs either through tuck-in acquisitions or potentially further divestitures as you've seen us do historically. Turning to the 2023 issuance environment. We saw strong growth in billed issuance in 2023, particularly in the second half. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see issuers returning to the market with billed issuance growth driven primarily by strength in bank loans, structured finance and high yield. This contributed to a successful rebound for the full year 2023 with billed issuance increasing 8%. Turning to Vitality. We're pleased to see the continued outperformance in our index to close out 2023. As we shared with you when we introduced this metric a little over a year ago, our goal is to make sure at least 10% of our revenue comes from new or enhanced products each year. As products mature, they'll naturally age out of the Vitality Index even if they continue to grow rapidly. But we remain committed to that 10% target as a steady stream of innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. We view the Vitality Index as a direct measure of the value our customers are realizing from the improvements we're making in our products and services each year. With 18% growth in revenue from Vitality products in 2023, we ended the year with more than 11% of our total revenue coming from these new offerings. This is an incredible achievement by our product development and commercial teams as they not only built great products and features in 2023 but also made sure our customers were aware and equipped to benefit from the innovation we are bringing to the table. Across divisions, we've seen new products in 2023 that demonstrate our commitment to Powering Global Markets in a world of rapidly evolving technology. First, in another compelling example of our cross-divisional development between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we launched our Power Evaluator tool. It's already received great feedback from power utility market participants. Additionally, in Commodity Insights, we combined the most powerful features of two leading commodity platforms, Platts Dimensions Pro and IHS Connect to create Platts Connect, which we believe is the market's most holistic source of data, insights and tools custom-built for commodity market participants. In Market Intelligence, we also significantly enhanced Capital IQ Pro. June saw the release of one of the largest and most important updates in years. And we're thrilled with the preliminary release of our new generative AI solution, ChatIQ, to a set of pilot customers in December. We're excited for more customers to get access to these proprietary tools as 2024 progresses. We also launched powerful new tools with our new Supplier Risk Indicator and Entity Insights offerings. In Ratings, we continue to deliver assessments and insights to help market participants evaluate different assets. And we leveraged our expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to launch the first Stablecoin Stability Assessment in late 2023. 2023 saw the launch of several new indices as well, including the S&P/B3 Corporate Bond Index in Brazil, multiple cross-asset indices and new sector, factor and thematic indices that we believe will contribute to strong growth in the years to come. As we mentioned last quarter, we want to provide an update on our AI strategy. We've elevated the focus on artificial intelligence to make sure we have executive leadership, governance and sponsorship at the enterprise level. In late 2023, we announced internally that our former Chief Information Officer, Swamy Kocherlakota, would take on the new role as Chief Digital Solutions Officer, including executive sponsorship of AI and Kensho. Bhavesh Dayalji, CEO of Kensho, has expanded his role to now lead cross-divisional AI initiatives as our first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer. These changes to our leadership structure around technology, and especially around AI, are the next logical steps in the commitment to AI that began with our initial investment in Kensho nearly 7 years ago. As part of this strategy, we've developed an AI accelerator to fast-track high-priority AI initiatives and build common capabilities that can be deployed and used by teams across the enterprise. There are four important ways that we expect our AI to impact our performance: first, through the development of new products and services; second, leveraging Kensho to accelerate and automate manual processes and data operations; third, amplifying the productivity of our internal experts, freeing up more capacity for higher order of work; and fourth, embedding AI functionality in existing products to increase customer value and improve user experience. We're committed to keeping you informed about these initiatives. So we've launched a new AI page on our public website, spglobal.ai, which includes important research, our key thought leadership and insights into our developments. At S&P Global, we have a strategic vision of the importance of AI to our industry and the world going forward as we believe that AI will quickly become embedded in everything we do. And we have a framework to deliver the best capabilities in as many products as we can and, by extension, into the hands of as many customers as we can as fast as we can. Fortunately, S&P Global starts with some of the most powerful proprietary datasets in the world sourced from all five divisions. Our proprietary data layer is a key differentiator that we believe sets us apart. As we've outlined for you in the past, we remain committed to sound governance, protecting this proprietary data and preventing third parties from monetizing or commercializing our data independently. A challenge that even data-rich companies will face is that much of this data isn't ready to be ingested or used by large language models. The data requires traditional machine learning preprocessing, things like data cleaning, data transformation, data reduction and data integration, but it also requires tokenization and tagging, which can be very resource-intensive. This is the Kensho layer. The proprietary tools developed over the last several years by the teams at Kensho automate much of the preprocessing work for both structured data like financial reports but also unstructured data like the transcript from this very earnings call. Tools like Scribe, NERD, Link, Extract and Classify do much of this heavy lifting and allow our proprietary data to be leveraged more easily and updated more quickly and frequently. This leads to the third element of our framework, the open ecosystem. As we've shared with you before, we aren't dependent on any individual technology partner. Having so much AI expertise in-house means that we can leverage infrastructure and compute platforms from multiple hyperscale cloud providers, third-party LLMs, our own proprietary LLMs and a wide array of other vendors without having to lock ourselves in or cede economics to one ecosystem or another. Ultimately, the goal is to have generative and traditional AI capabilities embedded everywhere that makes sense. We'll track our progress through improving customer win rates, retention rates, price and ultimately growth. It should also show up in our own workflows to improve productivity and efficiency, improving our unit economics and our operating margins over time. We're excited about the significant progress we've made in 2023 and even more excited about what this company will accomplish in 2024 and beyond. Our innovation also extends to the efforts we make to develop our people and improve our communities. In 2023, we held an internal event called Accelerate Progress LIVE to reinforce our commitment to our teams around the world and highlight our purpose and values as a global employer of choice. We provide dedicated time for our people to pursue volunteer opportunities. We saw an 89% increase in the number of S&P Global people who took advantage of these programs in 2023. And as more of our people return to our offices around the world, our global People Resource Groups saw a nearly 50% increase in engagement. We also demonstrated our commitment to continuously improve our reporting and transparency around our sustainability and related initiatives. In 2023, we published our 12th annual Impact Report and our fifth annual TCFD Report. We also published our first-ever Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, taking much of the information that we have been reporting for years, enhancing our disclosures and making that information more accessible in a dedicated report. We're very pleased that our efforts have been recognized by many external organizations in the last year. S&P Global has iconic global brands and is well-known as a desirable destination for highly skilled professionals around the world. We look forward to building upon that hard-won reputation in 2024. Turning to our financial results. Ewout will walk through the fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment. But the headline numbers tell a strong story for 2023. We're pleased to see accelerating growth and margin expansion in almost every division in 2023. The 2023 results and the 2024 guidance we're introducing today give us confidence in our trajectory towards the growth and margin targets we introduced at our 2022 Investor Day. As we approach the 2-year anniversary of the merger, we can definitively say it has been a success. In the last 2 years, not only have we brought together two world-class organizations, but we've delivered through a challenging period against our aspirational and ambitious targets. We integrated major software systems in record time and consolidated our offices around the world. We're able to close many of our data centers due in part to a transformational partnership with AWS. We've maintained a disciplined approach to managing our product portfolio. And we demonstrated this commitment through the divestiture of Engineering Solutions and the aftersales business in our Mobility division and also through the decommissioning of a number of low-margin or slower-growth products. Lastly, since the merger closed, we've returned $17.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We initially set a target of $480 million in cost synergies, then raised that target to $600 million and have now exceeded that higher target by $19 million. We're ahead of schedule on our revenue synergies to date, and we'll continue to report our progress there. Lastly, we told you when the merger closed that we believed it would be accretive to adjusted EPS by 2023. And I'm pleased to confirm that we have delivered. Both our internal analysis and independent external analysis indicate that in 2023, we delivered higher adjusted EPS than we likely would have generated with S&P Global as a stand-alone company. I'm thrilled to be able to call the merger a success and to move forward to Powering Global Markets as one company. Now I'll turn to Ewout to review the financial results. Ewout?"", 'Ewout Lucien Steenbergen', ""Thank you, Doug. We closed the year with strong fourth quarter performance overall as we saw growth across all five of our divisions. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% year-over-year. Reported revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. But excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year, revenue growth was 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by nearly 300 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 3%. Moving to our strategic investment areas. I'm pleased to report we saw growth across all categories. Sustainability & Energy Transition revenue grew 17% to $84 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand for our energy transition products and benchmark offerings. Sustainability & Energy Transition's full year revenue grew 24% to approximately $301 million. As we introduce more products and continue to innovate in the space, we remain committed to this important growth driver for the business. Moving to Private Market Solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $113 million, driven by strong growth in Ratings private market revenue, improved market conditions, increased bank loan issuance, private credit estimates and MI's software solutions. As we progress towards our goal of $600 million of Private Market Solutions revenue by 2026, I'm pleased to report full year revenue grew 10% to $430 million for 2023. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $380 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase compared to the prior year. Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter, again surpassing our index target of at least 10%. Now turning to synergies. As Doug mentioned earlier, we have completed our cost synergy program associated with the merger and outperformed our stated targets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized $156 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the year was $619 million, exceeding our goal of $600 million. For the full year, we recognized $581 million in cost savings from synergies. We had been targeting 85% of total cost synergies realized in 2023. And I'm pleased to see that we not only achieved that target, but that we surpassed it by more than $70 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $40 million in synergies achieved in the fourth quarter and an annualized run rate of $152 million exiting the year. Now turning to expenses. Our total expenses grew approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by increases in our core and investment growth areas and compensation expenses, which were partially offset by benefits associated with the Engineering Solutions divestiture and cost synergies. On core and investment growth, we continue to make the necessary investments in our strategic initiatives, which includes hiring the right people for key roles and investing in new and existing avenues of growth for our businesses. Within compensation, there are two factors I would like to call out. First, our salary expenses remained elevated due to hiring activity and inflationary pressures throughout 2023. Second, our benefit costs were higher due to finalization of benefits realignment of IHS Markit employees in the fourth quarter. As we go through the divisions, you will see these factors impacting expenses and margins this quarter, particularly in Market Intelligence and Mobility. This drove slightly higher expense growth than we were expecting. But total adjusted expenses still grew only 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter while revenue increased 7%. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 9%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop accelerated to 7% growth in the fourth quarter as continued product innovation, introduction of new content sets and improvements to speed and performance supported strong subscription growth. Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions grew 8% and 10%, respectively. Both benefited from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions grew 10% in the fourth quarter, supported by strong new sales and price realization. While renewal rates remained strong overall for MI, we did see slightly elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter as customers, particularly in the financial services vertical, continued to see some budgetary constraints. Combined with the modest softness in nonrecurring revenue, this resulted in total revenue for MI slightly below our expectations, though we continue to see accelerating growth for the division in the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 4% year-over-year primarily due to higher compensation expense, an increase in royalties and data costs, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit increased 18% and the operating margin increased 280 basis points to 34.2%. For full year 2023, margins improved by 120 basis points to 33%. The margin results are below our guidance range and are a result of a combination of an admittedly strong top line falling short of our expectations and expenses being slightly higher due to the reasons I mentioned. Now turning to Ratings. In the fourth quarter, we saw refinancing activity drive issuance as improving market conditions reduced borrowing costs and macroeconomic indicators gave issuers comfort coming to the market even in December, which is historically a very quiet month for debt issuance. Revenue increased 19% year-over-year, exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 10%, primarily due to an increase in annual and program fees and growth at CRISIL. Adjusted expenses increased 6%, driven by higher compensation, which includes hiring associated with growth initiatives at CRISIL and higher incentives due to financial performance. This resulted in a 32% increase in operating profit and an impressive 540 basis point increase in operating margin to 53.4%. For the full year 2023, margins increased by 60 basis points to 56.5%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 10% following a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by approximately 3% year-over-year, benefiting from strong demand for software product offerings as well as significant improvement in retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 13%, respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. Both business lines continue to see robust subscription sales driven by strong commercial momentum and enhanced value being delivered to customers. Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 8%, driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strength in energy transition-related product offerings. These market-driven volumes helped GTS deliver its strongest quarter of 2023. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by higher compensation and continued investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 10% and operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 44.4%. There are a few factors I would like to call out that contributed to CI's very modest margin contraction in the fourth quarter. In addition to the compensation drivers I mentioned earlier, we saw an increase in performance-related compensation due to the top line outperformance. We remain very confident in the growth opportunities for Commodity Insights and also wanted to make sure we continue to adequately invest to capture those opportunities. Trailing 12-month margin, which we believe is the best way to assess the performance of our divisions, increased by 180 basis points to 46.1% in 2023. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year. The dealer segment marked its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth while manufacturing and financials and other continued to deliver solid results. Dealer revenue increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing grew 2% year-over-year, driven by Planning Solutions and Marketing Solutions. Financials and other increased 5% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, driven primarily by higher compensation due to the benefits alignment already mentioned and also due in part to higher commissions related to revenue outperformance in our OEM and dealer businesses. We also incurred some inorganic expense growth on the Market Scan acquisition. In aggregate, these drivers resulted in an 8% increase in adjusted operating profit and 30 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, margins contracted 20 basis points to 38.8%. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 5% primarily due to strong growth in Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue and new business activities within Data & Custom Subscriptions. Revenue associated with Asset-Linked Fees were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. This was driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market appreciation and net inflows, leading to higher ETF fees and declines in OTC products. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue grew 22%, primarily driven by strong volumes in SPACs and fixed products and strong price realization. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 4% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower outside services and incentive expenses. Operating profit in Indices increased 11% and the operating margin increased 390 basis points to 66.1%. For the full year 2023, margins expanded 50 basis points to 68.9%. As we reflect on 2023 as a whole, I'm incredibly proud about the many things we're able to accomplish. We returned more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. We also continued to make the right investments in our strategy, allocating approximately $140 million to the enterprise initiatives that we have discussed with you. And we are encouraged by the fact that approximately 10% of the company's revenue growth came from those initiatives in 2023. On an inorganic basis, we executed a disciplined M&A strategy with tactical acquisitions immediately adding value to the enterprise. The optimization of our capital and liquidity structure completed earlier in the year provided $750 million of capital. Due to the prudent and strategic application of rate swaps, we're able to execute the debt issuance in a rising rate environment while avoiding an increase in our average cost of capital. With a team that can deliver impressive accomplishments like these in 2023, I'm confident this will continue under the leadership of the future CFO of S&P Global. Now I'll turn it back to Doug to cover the 2024 outlook."", 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Thank you, Ewout. We're updating our outlook to reflect our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024. While this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, these are some of the key factors we'll be tracking this year. We're currently expecting a soft landing scenario with a base case assumption that we avoid a global recession, though we expect geopolitical uncertainty to persist. We also expect energy transition and higher interest rates to remain factors. For the equity markets, we expect the secular tailwind that flows from active to passive management to continue. Though changes to market volatility can impact our ETD business in Indices and fluctuations in asset prices will have a lagged but potentially meaningful impact on our Asset-Linked Fees revenue. Early signs in 2024 indicate market optimism with the market currently pricing in multiple rate cuts in 2024. The timing of these potential cuts is unpredictable. But we expect the issuance environment to be stronger in the first half of the year than the back half. We expect continued focus on energy transition in the commodity markets with volatility in the evolving regulatory landscape having the potential to impact our results this year. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 2.8%, U.S. inflation of 2.4% and an average price for Brent crude of $83 per barrel. We're also forecasting billed issuance growth in the range of 3% to 7% in 2024 with stronger growth expected in the first half. While we've included a market issuance forecast in the past, we will only report on billed issuance going forward when discussing our outlook for our financial performance as it historically has been a better indicator of our revenue growth and aligns with our monthly disclosures. Turning to our most recent refinancing study. When we compare these refinancing walls to last year's study, we see that current year maturities, meaning 2024 maturities now, compared to 2023 maturities measured at this time last year are more than 10% higher than they were at this point last year. The maturities expected over the next 2- and 3-year periods are more than 12% higher. While we can't be certain how the higher rate environment will impact these maturities or issuers' likelihood to delever, we're confident that this puts us in a strong position to achieve the Ratings revenue targets we're outlining today for 2024. Now turning to our initial guidance for 2024. This slide illustrates our initial guidance for GAAP results. For adjusted guidance, we're expecting revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%, driven by strong growth in all 5 divisions. We expect organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures, in the range of 7% to 9%. We expect to deliver at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024. This will require us to maintain discipline around expenses and productivity while ensuring that we are making the necessary investments to drive growth and innovation in vital strategic areas like generative AI, sustainability, energy transition and private markets. We expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.75 to $14, which represents double-digit growth at the midpoint. It's important to note that our expected adjusted tax rate is nearly 2 percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2023. If our tax rate were to remain unchanged from 2023, we would expect adjusted EPS growth approximately 2 to 3 percentage points higher, consistent with the low to mid-teens growth rate we pointed to for 2025/2026 at our Investor Day. As you saw in our supplemental materials earlier this morning, we also expect adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of approximately $4.4 billion. We expect growth in adjusted free cash flow to be driven primarily by strong growth in revenue and profitability, though free cash flow growth will be tempered somewhat by the timing of working capital items and the full year impact of the $750 million debt offering completed in the third quarter of 2023. With the geopolitical, macroeconomic and market risk and opportunities we've discussed on this call, we expect that the financial outlook we've provided today likely has more upside risk than downside. And you can count on our focus, determination and discipline over the coming year. Our outlook for 2024 calls for further acceleration in revenue growth compared to 2023 and continued margin expansion, even though we will no longer have the benefit of the vast majority of our cost synergy actions going forward. Our financial outlook for 2024 illustrates our continued progress toward the targets we outlined at our Investor Day just over a year ago. And we remain committed to those targets. Moving to our division outlook. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5% with expected growth to be slightly higher in the back half than in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 33.5% to 34.5% as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives while maintaining rigorous discipline around expenses. For Ratings, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, driven by billed issuance growth of 3% to 7%. We expect revenue growth rates to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half as comparisons are easier in the first half and we expect some level of pull-forward, given the uncertainty around the timing of any potential rate actions by central banks. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9.5% and adjusted operating margins of 46.5% to 47.5%. For Mobility, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10% and adjusted operating margins of 39% to 40%. Lastly, for S&P Dow Jones Indices, we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% and adjusted operating margins in the range of 68.5% to 69.5%. As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, our Board has authorized a repurchase of shares totaling up to $2.4 billion, which we expect to execute throughout the year. And with that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions."", 'Mark Grant', 'Thank you, Doug. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now take our first question.', 'Operator', 'Our first question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.', 'Faiza Alwy', ""So I wanted to start with a big-picture question on Ratings, take advantage of Martina on the call. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the drivers behind the Ratings top line outlook. Doug mentioned 3% to 7% billed issuance growth. But give us a bit more color around transaction versus non-transaction growth and the various components, whether it's corporate, structured. You mentioned greater private assessment. So just a bit more color around what's underlying the revenue outlook."", 'Martina L. Cheung', ""Thanks very much for the question. So as Doug mentioned in his remarks, we do expect a stronger first half of this year, 2024, compared to the back half of the year. And I'll break it down a little bit. First, on the transaction revenue and our billed issuance estimate in the 3% to 7%, we're expecting to see continued refinancing activity that we saw build up in the back half of last year with high-yield and bank loans. And we saw that consistent in January. So we would expect to see that continue throughout the first half of this year. We would also expect to see some investment grade, although not as robust as last year. And part of that is just because so many investment-grade issuers tapped the market last year. Another potential factor there is the fact that we would see some investment-grade issuers being able to wait until the rates come down. Now some of the factors driving first half versus the second half, I would say anecdotally, we're hearing that issuers are looking to come to market to take advantage of strong investor appetite to lock in rates once they're higher and before the rates come down and ahead of potential volatility in the back half of the year. On transaction revenue, we would actually expect to see stronger frequent issuer program issuance this year than we saw last year. You won't see that in our billed issuance estimate, for example. And we would also expect to see continued strong performance in our surveillance book across CRISIL, our royalty and other products such as RES, or Ratings Evaluation Service. Overall though, as Doug said, we do expect stronger first half compared to second half. All of these factors that we take into consideration, including pace and timing of rate cuts, volatility, et cetera, these are all baked into our overall outlook. It is early in the year. And we will definitely seek to become more precise as we go throughout the year. But that's, I think, a good summary of where we're at."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.', 'Manav Shiv Patnaik', ""I just wanted to touch on the revenue synergies. You said I think it was $152 million annualized exiting the year. I think that's a number higher than what we would have thought of. I was just hoping you could give us some color on where -- what kind of areas those are coming from, what you've kind of baked into 2024 also perhaps."", 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Thank you, Manav. This is Doug. Well, we're really excited about what we've been able to achieve with the merger. And you've heard us talk about the power of the merger, the capital return that we had, the accretion to EPS, the cost synergies, which we now have delivered $619 million. And going forward, we're going to keep talking about the revenue synergies. When we look at the revenue synergies, they started off traditionally with cross-sell, cross-sell within divisions. This is where we were selling Commodity Insights products from the Platts customers to the IHS Markit customers and vice versa, same in the Market Intelligence business, where we're selling financial services products to corporate customers for Market Intelligence. But now we're starting to deliver the new products as well. And a combination of both of these has allowed us to be ahead of the schedule. We're very excited about the new products coming out. Let me give you one example from the Commodity Insights division, something called Platts Connect. Platts Connect is a product that took the platform of Platts Dimensions Pro and took the IHS Markit Connect platform, we put them together. We now have a very unique, single, holistic platform for prices, for research, for forecasting. But let me hand it over to Adam since he's on the call, and he can give us some more color for Market Intelligence."", 'Adam J. Kansler', ""Great. Thanks, Doug. The revenue synergy is obviously one of the most exciting parts of the combination of businesses. As Doug mentioned, the early successes have been in going to our customers with combined product capabilities that strengthen what we were already providing to those customers. We've seen outsized performance there even against our own expectations. What's really exciting as we get now into the years where we've landed those early merger synergies is the launch of new products. Doug mentioned a few. Over the course of 2023, we launched 7 new products just within Market Intelligence. We have 14 new products set to come to market across 2024. These will increasingly become part of what we're offering out to customers. Whether it's just putting our bond pricing in together with our credit analytics capability, looking at our economics and country risk data across our Desktop, incorporating sustainability data into our private markets portfolio management capabilities, these are all exciting areas that will continue to add to the growth of the business. You'll also see us announce some increasing generative AI capabilities across broader datasets of the combined businesses. I'm sure we'll talk a little bit more about that later on the call."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.', 'Gregory Scott Parrish', 'This is Greg Parrish on for Toni. Adam, just want to go back to you, talk about Market Intelligence, 6% to 7.5% revenue growth guide, similar to last year. Is, a, selling environment, has that improved at all? Or is that still a bit of a headwind? And then on the capital markets piece of the business, I think some of the Ipreo assets seeing some increased activity to start the year. So is there upside from that? Or are you still a little bit cautious?', 'Adam J. Kansler', ""Okay. Thank you for the call. We're very optimistic about continued growth in the business. And you've seen that progression from '22 to '23 and you see our guidance for 2024. Our end markets have had a pretty challenged period through '22 and '23, right? You've seen 30-plus percent declines in M&A activity, 34% decline in private equity investment activity. But even through that period, we've been able to deliver the solutions that our customers want. I think that will continue into '24. We do see some early activity in capital markets. But I think the way the full year will play out is yet to be seen. For us, going into the first quarter, we see more challenging comps. So we'll see a little bit slower start to year than we'll see towards the back half of the year. I am cautiously optimistic that as markets stabilize, that presents opportunity for us. But we want to be careful because our largest customer sets continue to be under pressure. You see that in the news every day. As we go into the beginning part of this year, we want to see how that ultimately plays out. But we feel pretty good about the guidance range we've put out."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.', 'Thomas Colton Roesch', ""This is Tom on for Andrew. I wanted to ask about ChatIQ. You mentioned you started piloting that in December. I was wondering what kind of customer feedback you're getting so far and what kind of benefits you can expect. Can it help increase pricing on the Cap IQ platform or any other benefits you're seeing there?"", 'Adam J. Kansler', ""Tom, thanks for the question. We're very excited about the early responses on ChatIQ. That's a tool that lets our customers get into our Desktop and get back actionable insights, lets them actually click through directly down to the source documents on what's one of the most robust datasets available to financial markets and corporate participants in the world. ChatIQ, very exciting, we are out with a few pilot customers. We'll start to release that out more broadly to our customer set over the course of 2024. But it's also not the only thing that we're doing with generative AI. You may have seen a press release in the last couple of days. We've actually launched now widely available to customers the ability to use generative AI to search in the S&P Global Marketplace, which is the place where you can go and look at all the datasets available across all of S&P Global. We're using generative AI to allow people to query into those datasets to get broader understanding of what's actually available through our company. We're pretty excited about that. And early responses have been positive. You'll also see releases from us during the year, things we're calling RegGPT, some other tools around our Ratings-related data that we deliver through Market Intelligence to allow our customers to probe into that data and get quick responses that help increase the speed within their own workflows. You'll continue to see this across the course of 2024. We're very focused on making sure we release things that are actually useful to our customers, enhance the value proposition of what we're delivering to them and ultimately embed our solutions more deeply into their workflows."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.', 'Alexander Eduard Maria Hess', 'This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I was hoping you guys could walk us through a little bit of the incremental margin outlooks embedded in your guide, especially for Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights, sort of -- and maybe Mobility, just sort of helpful to know sort of in those higher subscription businesses, what the puts and takes are on expenses and how we should see that flowing through to operating income.', 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Thanks, Alex. This is Doug. Let me start by saying that we always start our year with looking at how we're going to be able to grow our margins. We always build a budget that begins with top line growth. And we want to make sure that we can build our business through investment for innovation but also continue to deliver margin expansion. So you asked about each of the divisions. And each of the divisions has different characteristics for how we're moving forward. We have technology and productivity plans in place. But let me start with a couple of the divisions and then hand it over to Adam. So within the Commodity Insights division, we're looking at, as you saw, 8% growth to 9.5% growth with a margin expansion in the 46.5% to 47.5% range. We have growth in that area, in particular in energy transition products. We see high demand coming for new sorts of products that relate to carbon, to carbon intensity, to carbon markets, to different types of metals, which are going to be important for the energy transition. So we see a lot of growth in the area coming from energy transition on top of what are the regular markets there. We do have some investments taking place in the Commodity Insights division both for some regional expansion as well as some new products. When it comes to Mobility, we're making some investments in some new products in Mobility so that we will be able to grow our top line. As you see, we have an 8.5% to 10% revenue guide and a 39% to 40% margin guide. But we always operate all of our businesses beginning with top line with discipline to deliver growth. Just to mention before I hand it over to Adam, as you know, we've delivered 1,200 basis points of margin expansion over the last 10 years. So it's something that's in our DNA. But let me hand it over to Adam."", 'Adam J. Kansler', ""Sure. Just commenting briefly on margins within Market Intelligence. We do expect to continue to see expansion as we go into 2024. It's important for us to keep balancing the need for continued efficiency, looking for where we can operate more effectively and continue to drive margin expansion. We expect to do that on course to the levels that we laid out in the 2022 Investor Day but also balancing that with making the right investments to drive the increased top line growth that we also expect to deliver as we get towards those target dates that we laid out in the Investor Day as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.', 'Alexander Kramm', ""Just, I guess, continuing that last point, Adam, that you made. When I look at the revenue targets that you laid out at the Investor Day across the company, I think you're making good progress everywhere. But in Market Intelligence, I think it appears that if it's a steady path with the most behind. So maybe just coming back to the comments you made earlier in terms of the environment, is it the environment that needs to improve? Is it the revenue synergies that need to click more? Or what needs to happen to get to that 7% to 9% in 2025. Yes, and what are the biggest factors that get you there? And what's your confidence level, sorry?"", 'Adam J. Kansler', ""Thanks, Alex. Confidence level, high. We set those targets for 2025/2026. I think we're well on track to get there. Even in this current year, while coming in behind our goal, we're still right near the very bottom of that 7% to 9% growth range, right? We delivered a 6.9-or-so percent year. You've seen in our guidance, like we'll continue to push towards that. You identified actually a couple of the important factors. That synergy growth will continue to build. And we always said we'd start to see the real impact of that in years 3 through 5. And that's the period that we're just starting to enter. So you will see that continue to be a factor. The second biggest factor is we've gone through in 2022 and 2023 one of the toughest macro environments that we've seen, particularly for our customers over the last, certainly, 5 to 10 years. So as that macro environment improves, especially conditions for that customer set improves for us, it also sets us up to continue to accelerate towards those growth levels. Even through that challenging period, as I mentioned, we're delivering actually pretty close to that range and on a pretty straight line path into it and have pretty high confidence that we'll get there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Ashish Sabadra', ""I just wanted to focus or drill down further on the index business. There was a mention of declines in OTC products. I was wondering if you could provide some color on that front. And then as we get into 2024, I was wondering if you could provide some color on what are your assumptions around AUM growth. And then fees, which were a headwind this year, how should we think about those potentially becoming a tailwind in '24?"", 'Ewout Lucien Steenbergen', 'Ashish, this is Ewout. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to answer a question during my last call. Coming back to your point about OTC, obviously, if you look at AUM fees in the fourth quarter, you say, ""Hey, that\'s strange. Why is it flat when markets are up so much?"" And we see two underlying dynamics that go in opposite direction. So as we have always said, in AUM fees, there\'s many things that go there into the mix. There is mutual funds, there\'s OTCs and others. Actually, if we zoom in on ETFs, it\'s up about 8% in terms of fees. And that is helped by market depreciation as well as very strong inflows that we have seen into the ETF area but offset by OTC volumes that were down period-over-period. OTC volumes can always be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn\'t read too much into it. This can really change again the following quarter. So overall, I would say this is a normal trend that we are seeing here. With respect to the assumptions for 2024, first of all, the assumption is that AUM is up at mid-single-digit level; the ETD volumes, low single-digit increase; and then the subscription growth at a double-digit level for the index business for 2024. Those are the assumptions. Thank you, Ashish.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott Darren Wurtzel', ""Just moving back to the Ratings segment, and I'm thinking about the results and guidance here, sort of looking at that Slide 32 and seeing the decline in expected maturities for 2024. I was just wondering if you guys saw any pull-forward activity into the fourth quarter, given the decline in rates and tightening spreads that we saw and how that may have informed your outlook for 2024 here."", 'Martina L. Cheung', ""Scott, thanks for the question. We did see some pull-forwards more for '24, a little bit of '25 into 2023, not just in Q4, I would say. I mean, I think the sort of the repricing and other refinancing activity started to pick up momentum in the back half overall. And we've certainly seen that continue into this year. But I would maybe take a step back and perhaps sort of characterize how we build our outlook for the year. So absolutely, refinancing is very important. And as Doug mentioned in his remarks, the refinancing wall continues to grow nicely, which is a very healthy indicator for us. But we also look at a number of other factors, including the overall macro picture, whether it's GDP growth, pace and timing of interest rate cuts. We also look at opportunistic issuance. We know that's been historically very hard to predict. And that's become even more difficult in the last 2 years. And candidly, M&A, we don't have historic or heroic assumptions around M&A. As Adam mentioned earlier, it was down quite a bit last year. And while we're hearing a little bit of positive market sentiment, we need to see how that plays out throughout the course of the year. We also look at investor appetite, fund flows and how that could impact issuance across different asset classes. So for example, as I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see higher frequent issuer issuance this year than we did last year. And then we keep an eye on this throughout the course of the year, a lot of contacts with investors. I think we did -- we increased our investor meeting frequency quite a bit last year, so we're between the 25,000, 30,000 range of meetings with investors. So a lot of work goes into building up the bottom-up. It's not just the refinancing piece of it, although, of course, that's a good long-term indicator for us. And then just to kind of recap or draw a line under it, as Doug said, we would expect slightly faster first half than second half. And as we go throughout the year, we can come back to you with greater precision."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Jeffrey Marc Silber', ""In your prepared remarks, I think you had said you're constantly reviewing and optimizing your portfolio. Can we just kind of step back, maybe you can tell us what you're looking for, whether it's in tuck-in acquisitions or maybe more importantly, potential divestitures? Would it be possible to see a large divestiture in the future?"", 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Thank you, Jeff. As you know, we always apply a discipline to looking at our portfolio, looking at top line growth, looking at the margin expansion, also looking at how it fits across the portfolio. During the year last year, we didn't make a lot of noise about it, but we did shut down some very small products. We shut down 8,000 indices that were subpar, sub-sized across the businesses within Commodity Insights, Market Intelligence, some small products that we moved on. We also had a couple of small divestitures. But when you ask the question to us, we're constantly looking at the portfolio, trying to understand what fits best. We have different themes. You've heard us talk about the key themes, private market, sustainability, supply chain analytics, risk and credit. These are the sorts of areas that we're always looking to expand our presence to make sure we have the best capabilities possible to meet the needs of our clients. But within looking at the needs of clients, we look at the shareholders. We look at how we're going to put this portfolio together with the best way to leverage our technology. We will always apply the discipline as well to how we're going to look at the portfolio in the future."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.', 'Keen Fai Tong', ""I'd like to better understand your guidance for Ratings revenue growth in 2024. Do you expect billed debt issuance growth of 3% to 7% but Ratings revenue growth of only 6% to 8% in 2024, which would reflect little to no pricing benefit or mix headwinds? Can you help bridge the gap there?"", 'Martina L. Cheung', ""George, thanks for the question. So maybe I could start with transaction versus non-transaction and how we think about both of those. And as you know, transaction is a somewhat lower proportion of our revenues compared to, let's say, pre pandemic. On the transaction front and specific to billed issuance, as I said in my last response, we look at a variety of factors. Refinancing is a critical one, covered that in my last response, as well as the key macro drivers, when rate cuts could start, for example, what the exit rate on those looks like this year, the potential challenge in predicting opportunistic issuance. And there, we really do not have heroic assumptions around opportunistic issuance for this year. So we're being cautious on that. And then I would say, as I mentioned as well, that we would expect to see more frequent issuer issuance this year, which wouldn't show up in our billed issuance estimate of 3% to 7%. So I think with all of that, you have to take into consideration the potential wide range of outcomes, whether it's rates, whether it's almost half the world's population voting in elections and potential for greater volatility in the back half of the year. So that informs both the overall outlook of 3% to 7% billed issuance but also the timing that Doug has mentioned, which is a stronger first half versus second half. On the transaction side, we see strong performance across all key areas there. So that would include our surveillance book. It would include the RES portions of the book, for example, CRISIL as well as the royalty payment that we get from Market Intelligence. So maybe again, I would just reiterate, strong first half and tapering off in the back half. And then as Doug mentioned, it is early in the year. There is potential for upside in the range. And we will look to get more precise on this as we go throughout the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.', 'Craig Anthony Huber', ""Maybe just talk a little bit further about your guidance for the year about where potentially you could be conservative in your mind, whether it be on the cost side of things or you're baking in too much assumption for cost there or on the top line, what segments potentially coming ahead of your outlook at this stage of the game."", 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Thanks, Craig. As you saw when we put together our information we put in our slides, what are the key factors that we look at? And when you take a step back, we know that GDP growth is always the #1 driver. It's the highest correlated factor to our long-term revenue growth. We've looked over the years to see what are those factors that drive it the most. We see some potential slowdown in the economy in the U.S. and in EU. We're planning for what we call -- we're planning against what we call a soft landing, which means that there could be some sort of slowdown in the economy. As you heard, we've seen some slowness and a little bit of longer sales cycles in certain segments. But that's -- those are some of the downside factors. What would happen with the geopolitical factors, how long will it take before central banks begin to cut rates, we've taken those into account as we built our guidance with some conservatism. So if we saw a much quicker return to lower interest rates, if we saw much quicker -- a geopolitical environment that was more stable, these are the kinds of things that create some upside for the company. We also look at segment-by-segment. We know that the automotive segment is going through a lot of change. We know that the energy transition, which is changing the commodity cycle. So we've taken into account all of these different factors as we've looked at the -- overall at the guidance. So to your upside risk -- upside opportunities, we think that it could come if interest rates move down lower faster, if the interest rates -- if the economies grow faster than we think, et cetera. But these are all the factors we take into account across the divisions as we're setting up our guidance for 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo.', 'John Peter Bonner Mazzoni', ""Could you just help us understand how you're thinking about the longer-term generative AI monetization, specifically around cross-platforming as well as potential kind of upsell and cross-sell from kind of new products?"", 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Great. Thank you for that. And when we think about technology, when we think about AI, we start with the framework that we showed you in our prepared remarks today, which has the foundation of very strong proprietary data. We think that this is going to be one of the most important factors for AI becoming successful at any company, no matter where they are. And we think that this gives us a running start in addition to what we've already been developing with Kensho over the last 5 years. But turning that into earnings and turning that into growth is something that we're starting to build. We think that the AI opportunities we have, Adam talked earlier about ChatIQ, is an example of something that gives customers the opportunity to dig much, much deeper into our data. We think that it's going to create stickiness. We're starting with metrics that look at, for example, our Net Promoter Scores. We're looking at retention. We're looking at how people, how -- what kind of feedback we get from calls from customers that are calling in to see how we're doing. We also believe that right now, we're going to be able to continue to meet our guidance that we gave you for our -- in our Investor Day in 2022. We'll be able to continue along that track. And then we'll be able to come out with much more precise guidance for the impact of AI across our portfolio in the future. But we see this as something that's going to be a game changer for all of our businesses. It's going to be embedded in everything we do. And we're just now learning how we're going to measure those impacts. But let me hand it over to Adam because he's very close to a couple of the end market opportunities that we have right now."", 'Adam J. Kansler', ""Great. Thanks, Doug, and thank you for the question. As Doug mentioned, we do think generative AI has a transformative potential across almost all of our products. Remember, we are one of the largest data providers in the world. And the one thing we have is a highly trusted, highly developed, accurate set of data across our businesses, whether that's in Market Intelligence or the other divisions of our business. We're also deeply embedded in the workflows of our customers. The combination of those two, and when you really understand the power behind generative AI to unlock the potential in massive datasets that may correlate to each other, may have unique insights and the ability to process through that in a very rapid time frame, for us, thinking about portfolio monitoring workflows, research and insights, credit assessments, risk assessment, looking across broad sets of data for insights and what's developing in various sectors or regions or how it could impact the portfolio. Those are all opportunities for us for making the datasets and workflows that we already provide today to our customers all the more powerful. When we look at the opportunity set in front of us and even just our product launch sheet for 2024, we're pretty encouraged that we're well positioned to take advantage of the technology, increase the penetration we have with our customers and expand the kinds of services and insights we're able to give them efficiently. That also increases the efficiency of their own internal workflows, which obviously comes with significant value. We'll see how that all materializes and how we're able to monetize that. But we do think it's a tailwind for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.', 'Jeffrey P. Meuler', ""Ewout, when you described some of the costs that were higher than expected, things like the heritage IHS Markit employee benefit cost, it wasn't clear to me. Was there a true-up that was specific to Q4? Or was there a greater-than-expected step-up in the expense baseline that's happening now? And then on '24 tax rate, what drives the step-up? And is the new rate kind of like a good steady-state rate for the portfolio?"", 'Ewout Lucien Steenbergen', ""Yes, thanks, Jeff. So let me explain what is benefits realignment. So benefits realignment is that we brought, as of January 1, 2023, all of our employees across the world to the same benefits package. Because we think it is fair that we should treat everyone the same in every country around the world, so think about the medical plans, think about the retirement plans. We have made estimates about the expenses for 2023. And for the first 3 quarters, the expenses came in exactly in line with our expectations. But they exceeded the expectations in the fourth quarter. And benefits costs are always not 100% certain. Because just to give an example, the medical costs in the U.S. were self-insured. So they can be higher if we have higher medical claims or the matching for 401(k) contributions can be higher. So we're seeing this more as a one-time step-up cost. And that should be in our baseline going forward from 2024 onwards. Your second part of your question about the tax rate, we saw in 2023 a bit of a benefit in the tax rate in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And then we are seeing some upward pressure in the tax rate in 2024. So to expand on that, on the third quarter of 2023, we had some favorable new guidance with respect to the utilization of foreign tax credits. And then in the fourth quarter, we had the conclusion of certain state tax audits that led to some reserve releases. So it brought the effective tax rate a little bit down in 2023 compared to a normalized level. And what we're seeing in 2024, the implementation of Pillar 2 global minimum tax in several jurisdictions as well as the U.K. statutory tax rate is going up. So 2024 is, I think, the right level to think about this. Where tax rate will go from a longer-term perspective is really hard to say because it really depends on government finances and where that will go around the world in the future."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic.', 'Russell Quelch', ""Sorry to go back to this, but on the Ratings business, your macro forecast are implying what I think is a soft landing conducive for rate cuts. And as I understand that the maturity walls built throughout the year, I appreciate some of that could be pulled forward into the front end. But I'm still struggling to square this sort of front-end loaded observation when you discuss revenues relative to your macro guidance. So maybe you could explain that again, please, and also what you're assuming for the non-transaction revenue growth in '24, sorry if I missed that."", 'Martina L. Cheung', ""Thanks so much, Russell, for the question. Just a quick one on the non-transaction, we don't separate out our guidance between transaction and non-transaction. But as I said, we do expect robust performance in our non-transaction part of the book this year. The picture is a little counterintuitive, in fact, for the timing piece. Because you would, in fact, expect, given our kind of predictions of three rate cuts, for example, by the Feds starting in the middle of the year this year that you might see a more even result with issuance throughout the year. What we're actually hearing from the market is a little bit different. So for bank loans and high yield, for example, we're seeing and hearing a couple of things. Number one, issuers have accepted the higher for longer. But more importantly, number two, there's a good, really good, strong investor appetite for these asset classes. And pricing is much more constructive this year, for example, than it was same time last year. So these issuers are coming to market. There's a high volume of repricing into that. So for example, the bank loan, January volumes for repricing was actually around, if not a little bit higher than, the full year 2023 repricing that we saw in bank loans. And then on investment grade, some of that -- we see that taper a little bit this year compared to last year. The reason for that is that there were so many issuers that came to market last year. But also, those that are sitting waiting for rate cuts can afford to actually absorb what they're sitting on today, whether it's using commercial paper or otherwise to wait for some of those rate cuts to play out. Hopefully, that answers your question. As I said, it's early. We're in the first half of February. And this is our base case. There's a pretty wide range of possibilities here. And we'll look to get much more precise as we go throughout the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.', 'Adam Parrington', 'This is Adam on for Shlomo. Can you discuss the level of incentive compensation in the quarter and what is implied in 2024 versus 2023? And how much does this impact the margin guidance for 2024 as well?', 'Ewout Lucien Steenbergen', 'Yes, we brought up incentive compensation accruals in the fourth quarter. And that was driven by the strong top line performance from both the Ratings and Commodity Insights. So for the total year 2023, our cash bonus incentive accruals are now ending up at a level above 100%. What we always do when we do planning is to reset cash bonus incentives back to 100% from a planning perspective for the next year. So for 2024 in the plan is embedded a 100% payout of our cash bonuses.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.', 'Emily Marzo', ""This is Emily Marzo on for Heather Balsky. You talked about elevated cancellations in Market Intelligence. Could you give us some details on what type and maybe size of customers you're seeing cancel? And what kind of discussions you've had so far this year?"", 'Adam J. Kansler', ""Heather, it's Adam. Thank you for the question. So through the fourth quarter, in particular, the places where we saw cancellations were actually in our smallest customers, right, customers under relatively low threshold. Our larger customers, while under pressure due to a range of macro reasons, those are places where we have opportunity in a vendor consolidation initiative, where those customers are looking to consolidate the number of vendors they work with. Given the scale and scope of relationship that they have with S&P Global, that often presents opportunity for us. And accordingly, we saw much stronger renewal rates in that group of customers than we did amongst our smallest customers. I think the other places where we see pressure is discretionary spend, where customers have a decision whether to undertake a consulting project or a new initiative. Those are places where customers have been a little bit more hesitant into the fourth quarter. And we're hopeful that will continue to stabilize as we get into 2024."", 'Operator', 'We will now take our final question from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.', 'Owen Lau', ""I just want to go back to AI. And I think AI, it's great and there are lots of potential. But it looks like whether clients will actually pay extra for it, it's still uncertain. I'm just wondering what makes you confident that you can develop a killer app that people will use it and pay for it."", 'Douglas L. Peterson', ""Thank you, Owen. Well, we take a view that AI is going to be embedded in everything we do. And we don't think there's going to be a killer app. It would be great if there were, but that's not our plan. Our plan is to look at AI to see how it can improve our productivity, how we can use it with our developers, our data management, data linking, et cetera, up into how we're going to improve our products and build products and link them over time. As you heard from Adam, we've got a few very exciting products that are already being tested in the market. We've launched one recently and then we've got some more coming. We also have the capabilities of Kensho, which are available on the Marketplace. So we don't think of it as a killer app. We think of it as continuous improvement. And we think that if you look at it over time, it's going to be something that's going to change the way we work and the way that our people work. So we're really excited about it. We're also excited that we have such a strong internal team that we're one of the first companies who was able to name a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, somebody who has the experience of Kensho, of being the CEO there with the expertise. We have an open model in terms of the ecosystem we're going to be working with. So we're not looking for a killer app, but we're looking to see every single way we can use it and how it's going to improve the way we serve our customers as well to manage the business. So thank you, Owen. Let me make a couple of closing remarks. And first of all, I want to thank all of you as usual for being on the call and for your excellent questions. And it was great to have Adam and Martina on the call today. And I'm really excited about everything that we're able to deliver in 2023. We delivered what we think is the promise of the merger. As you know, we've paid back over $17.5 billion of capital over the last 2 years since the merger. We've been delivering innovation. We delivered on our synergies. So we're excited about taking that energy and all of the incredible work that our people have done and turning that now into growth into the future. I also want to thank our people as always for their incredible work. It's what made 2023 what it is and it's what makes me very confident about the foundation we have for going forward and especially our leadership team, who is focused on growth, innovation and execution. This is our last earnings call with Ewout. He's been with us for 7 years of remarkable service, and I want to thank him. He's helped shape our financial strategy. I know that everybody is very pleased with our margin and as well as our capital return. And that's something that Ewout has been instrumental in. He's helped us lead with our accelerated growth with our innovation. And he's had a tremendous impact. He partnered with us on all of the major strategic transactions. He's been the sponsor of Kensho for the last 5 years, which we now talked about many times on this call, the importance that brings to the company, as well as one of the initial architects as well as executors of the IHS Markit merger. So he's done a fantastic job building a world-class finance organization. As we previously announced, our current Chief Accounting Officer, Chris Craig, will be named as the interim CFO on Monday. And he has done a fantastic job here for the last 13 years. And he's going to continue to evaluate the businesses and as we look both internally and externally for candidates for the permanent role, and I look forward to working with Chris in his role. But again, thank you, Ewout. We wish you the best in your new role and continued success in your career. And please keep making the world a better place with your leadership with UNICEF. So again, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Great questions, and we're very excited about the future. Thank you very much."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. That concludes this morning's call.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?', 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Mark. 2022 was an exciting year for S&P Global, a year of innovation and growth. Our results in 2023 serve as a testament to strong execution and S&P Global's unique position at the center of the global markets. Excluding engineering solutions, which was divested in the second quarter of last year, revenue increased 8% year over year."", ""We expanded adjusted operating margins by almost 300 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter to finish the year with approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion, and we surpassed our $600 million target for cost synergies by $19 million. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 13% to come into the high end of our guidance range as we continue to benefit from strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management, and a commitment to strong capital returns. On the topic of capital returns, 2023 marked the 50th consecutive year that S&P Global has increased its cash dividend, and we've already announced the board approval to make 2024 the 51st. In 2023, we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, representing more than 100% of our adjusted free cash flow."", ""In addition to strong financial performance, we created a formal artificial intelligence leadership team in 2023, which we'll discuss in more detail shortly. We also delivered double-digit growth and significant innovation in key strategic investment areas. Private market solutions and sustainability and energy transition both delivered double-digit growth in 2023, and we're well-positioned to continue growing in these important areas in 2024. Our Vitality Index, which we target to remain at or above 10% of company revenue, actually exceeded 11% in 2023 and also increased at a double-digit rate."", 'In 2023, we delivered key wins in each of the five strategic pillars we introduced at the end of 2022. We look forward to accelerating that success in 2024 and continuing our track record of creating value for our customers and our shareholders. We know that our success depends on creating value for our customers, and we delivered for them in 2023. We improved customer retention rates in several of our divisions last year while continuing to introduce new products and features more quickly and more frequently.', 'Through deep engagement with customers around the world, tens of thousands of customer touchpoints, we saw continued adoption of enterprise contracts in Market Intelligence and acceleration of enterprise agreements in Commodity Insights. We know that certain customer verticals, particularly financial services and regional banks, had unique challenges in 2023. While we discussed longer sales cycles through 2023, we were able to keep our sales pipeline moving and continue to demonstrate value for our customers, even in challenging times. As we look to 2024, we continue to see macroeconomic, market, and geopolitical challenges.', 'Our customers need unique and differentiated data sets and key insights for the markets they serve, which means our role as a trusted and strategic partner is more important than ever. Now nearly two years after the merger, we put the work of operational integration behind us, and we have fully turned to the exciting work of growth, innovation, and execution. We remain committed to balancing margin expansion with strategic initiatives and long-term growth. We will also look for ways to optimize our portfolio of products and services.', ""With the merger integration behind us, we plan to continue reviewing and optimizing our portfolio of assets to meet our customers' needs, either through tuck-in acquisitions or potentially further divestitures, as you've seen us do historically. Turning to the 2023 issuance environment, we saw strong growth in build issuance in 2023, particularly in the second half. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see issuers returning to the market with build issuance growth driven primarily by strength in bank loans, structured finance, and high yield. This contributed to a successful rebound for the full-year 2023 with build issuance increasing 8%."", ""Turning to vitality, we're pleased to see the continued outperformance in our index to close out 2023. As we shared with you when we introduced this metric a little over a year ago, our goal is to make sure at least 10% of our revenue comes from new or enhanced products each year. As products mature, they'll naturally age out of the Vitality Index, even if they continue to grow rapidly, but we remain committed to that 10% target as a steady stream of innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. We view the Vitality Index as a direct measure of the value our customers are realizing from the improvements we're making in our products and services each year."", ""With 18% growth in revenue from vitality products in 2023, we ended the year with more than 11% of our total revenue coming from these new offerings. This is an incredible achievement by our product development and commercial teams as they not only built great products and features in 2023 but also made sure our customers were aware and equipped to benefit from the innovation we were bringing to the table. Across divisions, we've seen new products in 2023 that demonstrate our commitment to powering global markets in the world of rapidly evolving technology. First, in another compelling example of our cross-divisional development between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we launched our Power Evaluator tool."", ""It's already received great feedback from power utility market participants. Additionally, in Commodity Insights, we combine the most powerful features of two leading commodity platforms, Platts Dimensions Pro and IHS Connect, to create Platts Connect, which we believe is the market's most holistic source of data, insights, and tools custom-built for commodity market participants. In Market Intelligence, we also significantly enhanced Capital IQ Pro. June saw the release of one of the largest and most important updates in years, and we're thrilled with the preliminary release of our new generative AI solution Chat IQ to a set of pilot customers in December."", ""We're excited for more customers to get access to these proprietary tools as 2024 progresses. We also launched powerful new tools with our new Supplier Risk Indicator and Entity Insights offerings. In Ratings, we continue to deliver assessments and insights to help market participants evaluate different assets, and we leveraged our expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to launch the first stablecoin stability assessment in late 2023. 2023 saw the launch of several new indices as well, including the S&P/B3 Corporate Bond Index in Brazil; multiple cross-asset indices; and new sector, factor, and thematic indices that we believe will contribute to strong growth in the years to come."", ""As we mentioned last quarter, we want to provide an update on our AI strategy. We've elevated the focus on artificial intelligence to make sure we have executive leadership, governance, and sponsorship at the enterprise level. In late 2023, we announced internally that our former chief information officer, Swamy Kocherlakota, would take on the new role as chief digital solutions officer, including executive sponsorship of AI and Kensho. Bhavesh Dayalji, CEO of Kensho, has expanded his role to now lead cross-divisional AI initiatives as our first chief artificial intelligence officer."", ""These changes to our leadership structure around technology and especially around AI are the next logical steps in the commitment to AI that began with our initial investment in Kensho nearly seven years ago. As part of this strategy, we've developed an AI accelerator to fast track high-priority AI initiatives and build common capabilities that can be deployed and used by teams across the enterprise. There are four important ways that we expect our AI to impact our performance: first, through the development of new products and services; second, leveraging Kensho to accelerate and automate manual processes and data operations; third, amplifying the productivity of our internal experts, freeing up more capacity for higher order work; and fourth, embedding AI functionality in existing products to increase customer value and improve user experience. We're committed to keeping you informed about these initiatives, so we've launched a new AI page on our public website, spglobal.ai, which includes important research, our key thought leadership, and insights into our developments."", ""At S&P Global, we have a strategic vision of the importance of AI to our industry and the world going forward as we believe that AI will quickly become embedded in everything we do, and we have a framework to deliver the best capabilities in as many products as we can and by extension into the hands of as many customers as we can as fast as we can. Fortunately, S&P Global starts with some of the most powerful proprietary data sets in the world, sourced from all five divisions. Our proprietary data layer is a key differentiator that we believe sets us apart. As we've outlined for you in the past, we remain committed to sound governance, protecting this proprietary data, and preventing third parties from monetizing or commercializing our data independently."", ""A challenge that even data-rich companies will face is that much of this data isn't ready to be ingested or used by large language models. The data requires traditional machine learning preprocessing, things like data cleaning, data transformation, data reduction, and data integration, but it also requires tokenization and tagging, which can be very resource intensive. This is the Kensho layer. The proprietary tools developed over the last several years by the teams at Kensho automate much of the preprocessing work for both structured data like finance reports but also unstructured data like the transcript from this very earnings call."", ""Tools like Scribe, NERD, Link, Extract, and Classify do much of this heavy lifting and allow our proprietary data to be leveraged more easily and updated more quickly and frequently. This leads to the third element of our framework, the open ecosystem. As we've shared with you before, we aren't dependent on any individual technology partner. Having so much AI expertise in-house means that we can leverage infrastructure and compute platforms from multiple hyperscale cloud providers, third-party LLMs, our own proprietary LLMs, and a wide array of other vendors without having to lock ourselves in or cede economics to one ecosystem or another."", ""Ultimately, the goal is to have generative and traditional AI capabilities embedded everywhere that makes sense. We'll track our progress through improving customer win rates, retention rates, price, and ultimately, growth. It should also show up in our own workflows to improve productivity and efficiency, improving our unit economics and our operating margins over time. We're excited about the significant progress we've made in 2023, and we're even more excited about what this company will accomplish in 2024 and beyond."", 'Our innovation also extends to the efforts we make to develop our people and improve our communities. In 2023, we held an internal event called Accelerate Progress: Live to reinforce our commitment to our teams around the world and highlight our purpose and values as a global employer of choice. We provide dedicated time for our people to pursue volunteer opportunities. We saw an 89% increase in the number of S&P Global people who took advantage of these programs in 2023.', ""And as more of our people return to our offices around the world, our global People Resource groups saw nearly 50% increase in engagement. We also demonstrated our commitment to continuously improve our reporting and transparency around our sustainability and related initiatives. In 2023, we published our 12th annual Impact Report and our fifth annual TCFD report. We also published our first-ever Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, taking much of the information that we've been reporting for years, enhancing our disclosures, and making that information more accessible in a dedicated report."", ""We're very pleased that our efforts have been recognized by many external organizations in the last year. S&P Global has iconic global brands and is well known as a desirable destination for highly skilled professionals around the world. We look forward to building upon that hard-won reputation in 2024. Turning to our financial results, Ewout will walk through the fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment, but the headline numbers tell a strong story for 2023."", ""We're pleased to see accelerating growth in margin expansion in almost every division in 2023. The 2023 results and the 2024 guidance we're introducing today give us confidence in our trajectory toward the growth and margin targets we introduced at our 2022 investor day. As we approach the two-year anniversary of the merger, we can definitively say it has been a success. In the last two years, not only have we brought together two world-class organizations, but we've delivered through a challenging period against our aspirational and ambitious targets."", ""We integrated major software systems in record time and consolidated our offices around the world. We were able to close many of our data centers due, in part, to a transformational partnership with AWS. We've maintained a disciplined approach to managing our product portfolio, and we demonstrated this commitment through the divestiture of engineering solutions and the aftersales business in our Mobility division and also through the decommissioning of a number of low-margin or slower-growth products. Lastly, since the merger closed, we've returned $17.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends."", ""We initially set a target of $480 million in cost synergies then raised that target to $600 million and have now exceeded that higher target by $19 million. We're ahead of schedule on our revenue synergies to date and will continue to report our progress there. Lastly, we told you when the merger closed that we believed it would be accretive to adjusted EPS by 2023, and I'm pleased to confirm that we have delivered. Both our internal analysis and independent external analysis indicate that in 2023, we delivered higher adjusted EPS than we likely would have generated with S&P Global as a stand-alone company."", ""I'm thrilled to be able to call the merger a success and to move forward to powering global markets as one company. Now I'll turn to Ewout to review the financial results. Ewout?"", 'Ewout Steenbergen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Doug. We closed the year with strong fourth quarter performance overall as we saw growth across all five of our divisions. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% year over year. Reported revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter.', ""But excluding the impact of the engineering solutions divestiture and the small tokens done earlier this year, revenue growth was 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by nearly 300 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 3%. Moving to our strategic investment areas. I'm pleased to report we saw growth across all categories."", 'Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 17% to $84 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand for our energy transition products and benchmark offerings. Sustainability and energy transitions full-year revenue grew 24% to approximately $301 million. As we introduce more products and continue to innovate in the space, we remain committed to this important growth driver for the business. Moving to private market solutions, we saw revenue increased by 18% year over year to $113 million, driven by strong growth in ratings private market revenue as improved market conditions, increased bank loan issuance, private credit estimates, and MI software solutions.', ""As we progress toward our goal of $600 million of private market solutions revenue by 2026, I'm pleased to report full-year revenue grew 10% to $430 million for 2023. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $380 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase compared to the prior year. Importantly, vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter, again surpassing our index target of at least 10%. Now turning to synergies."", 'As Doug mentioned earlier, we have completed our cost synergy program associated with the merger and outperformed our stated targets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized $156 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the year was $619 million, exceeding our goal of $600 million. For the full year, we recognized $581 million in cost savings from synergies.', ""We had been targeting 85% of total cost synergies realized in 2023, and I'm pleased to see that we not only achieved that target but that we surpassed it by more than $70 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $40 million in synergies achieved in the fourth quarter and an annualized run rate of $152 million exiting the year. Now turning to expenses. Our total expenses grew approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by increases in our core and investment growth areas and compensation expenses, which were partially offset by benefits associated with the engineering solutions divestiture and cost synergies."", 'On core and investment growth, we continue to make the necessary investments in our strategic initiatives, which includes hiring the right people for key roles and investing in new and existing avenues of growth for our businesses. Within compensation, there are two factors I would like to call out. First, our salary expenses remained elevated due to hiring activity and inflationary pressures throughout 2023. Second, our benefit costs were higher due to finalization of benefits realignment of IHS Markit employees in the fourth quarter.', ""As we go through the divisions, you will see these factors impacting expenses and margins this quarter, particularly in Market Intelligence and Mobility. This drove slightly higher expense growth than we were expecting, but total adjusted expenses still grew only 2% year over year in the fourth quarter, while revenue increased 7%. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 9%, driven by strong growth in data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions."", 'Desktop accelerated to 7% growth in the fourth quarter as continued product innovation, introduction of new content sets, and improvements to speed and performance supported strong subscription growth. Data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions grew 8% and 10%, respectively. Both benefited from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit and risk solutions grew 10% in the fourth quarter supported by strong new sales and price realization.', 'While renewal rates remained strong overall for MI, we did see slightly elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter as customers, particularly in the financial services vertical, continued to see some budgetary constraints. Combined with the modest softness in nonrecurring revenue, this resulted in total revenue for MI slightly below our expectations, though we continue to see accelerating growth for the division in the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 4% year over year, primarily due to higher compensation expense and increase in royalties and data costs, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit increased 18%, and the operating margin increased 280 basis points to 34.2%.', 'For full-year 2023, margins improved by 120 basis points to 33%. The margin results are below our guidance range and are a result of a combination of an admittedly strong top line falling short of our expectations and expenses being slightly higher due to the reasons I mentioned. Now turning to Ratings. In the fourth quarter we saw refinancing activity drive issuance as improving market conditions reduced borrowing costs and macroeconomic indicators gave issuers comfort coming to the market, even in December, which is historically a very quiet month for debt issuance.', 'Revenue increased 19% year over year, exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high yield issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 10%, primarily due to an increase in annual and program fees and growth at CRISIL. Adjusted expenses increased 6%, driven by higher compensation, which includes hiring associated with growth initiatives at CRISIL and higher incentives due to financial performance.', 'This resulted in a 32% increase in operating profit and an impressive 540-basis-point increase in operating margin to 53.4%. For the full-year 2023, margins increased by 60 basis points to 56.5%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 10%, following a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both price assessments and energy and resources data and insights.', 'Upstream data and insights revenue grew by approximately 3% year over year, benefiting from strong demand for software product offerings, as well as significant improvement in retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Price assessments and energy and resources data and insights grew 12% and 13%, respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products.', 'Both business lines continue to see robust subscription sales, driven by strong commercial momentum and enhanced value being delivered to customers. Advisory and transactional services revenue grew 8%, driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in global trading services and strength in energy transition-related product offerings. These market-driven volumes helped GTS deliver its strongest quarter of 2023. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by higher compensation and continued investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost synergies.', ""Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 10%, and operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 44.4%. There are a few factors I would like to call out that contributed to CI's very modest margin contraction in the fourth quarter. In addition to the compensation drivers I mentioned earlier, we saw an increase in performance-related compensation due to the top-line outperformance. We remain very confident in the growth opportunities for Commodity Insights and also wanted to make sure we continue to adequately invest to capture those opportunities."", 'Trailing 12-month margin, which we believe is the best way to assess the performance of our divisions, increased by 180 basis points to 46.1% in 2023. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year over year. The dealer segment marked its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while manufacturing and financials and other continued to deliver solid results. Dealer revenue increased 14% year over year, driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life, as well as the addition of Market Scan.', 'Manufacturing grew 2% year over year, driven by planning solutions and marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 5% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, driven primarily by higher compensation due to the benefits alignment I already mentioned and also due, in part, to higher commissions related to revenue outperformance in our OEM and dealer businesses. We also incurred some inorganic expense growth on the Market Scan acquisition.', 'In aggregate, these drivers resulted in an 8% increase in adjusted operating profit and 30 basis points of operating margin contraction year over year in the fourth quarter. For full-year 2023, margins contracted to 20 basis points to 38.8%. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, revenue increased 5%, primarily due to strong growth in exchange-traded derivatives revenue and new business activities within data and custom subscriptions. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees were relatively flat in the fourth quarter.', 'This was driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market appreciation and net inflows, leading to higher ETF fees and declines in OTC products. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 22%, primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX and fixed products and strong price realization. Data and custom subscriptions increased 4% year over year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses decreased 6% year over year, primarily driven by lower outside services and incentive expenses.', ""Operating profit in indices increased 11%, and the operating margin increased 390 basis points to 66.1%. For the full-year 2023, margins expanded 50 basis points to 68.9%. As we reflect on 2023 as a whole, I'm incredibly proud about the many things we're able to accomplish. We returned more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders."", ""We also continue to make the right investments in our strategy, allocating approximately $140 million to the enterprise initiatives that we have discussed with you, and we're encouraged by the fact that approximately 10% of the company's revenue growth came from those initiatives in 2023. On an inorganic basis, we executed a disciplined M&A strategy with tactical acquisitions immediately adding value to the enterprise. The optimization of our capital and liquidity structure completed earlier in the year provided $750 million of capital. Due to the prudent and strategic application of rate swaps, we're able to execute the debt issuance in a rising rate environment while avoiding an increase in our average cost of capital."", ""With a team that can deliver impressive accomplishments like these in 2023, I'm confident this will continue under the leadership of the future CFO of S&P Global. Now I'll turn it back to Doug to cover the 2024 outlook."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Ewout. We're updating our outlook to reflect our economist's view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024. While this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, these are some of the key factors we'll be tracking this year. We're currently expecting a soft-landing scenario with a base case assumption that we avoid a global recession though expect geopolitical uncertainty to persist."", 'We also expect energy transition and higher interest rates to remain factors. For the equity markets, we expect the secular tailwind of flows from active to passive management to continue, though changes to market volatility can impact our ETD business and indices and fluctuations in asset prices will have a lagged but potentially meaningful impact on our asset-linked fees revenue. Early signs in 2024 indicate market optimism with the market currently pricing in multiple rate cuts in 2024. The timing of these potential cuts is unpredictable, but we expect the issuance environment to be stronger in the first half of the year than the back half.', ""We expect continued focus on energy transition in the commodity markets with volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape having a potential to impact our results this year. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 2.8%, U.S. inflation of 2.4%, and an average price for Brent crude of $83 per barrel. We're also forecasting build issuance growth in the range of 3% to 7% in 2024 with stronger growth expected in the first half."", ""While we've included a market issuance forecast in the past, we will only report on build issuance going forward when discussing our outlook for our financial performance as it historically has been a better indicator of our revenue growth and aligns with our monthly disclosures. Turning to our most recent refinancing study. When we compare these refinancing levels to last year's study, we see that current-year maturities, meaning 2024 maturities now compared to 2023 maturities measured at this time last year, are more than 10% higher than they were at this point last year. The maturity as expected over the next two- and three-year periods are more than 12% higher."", ""While we can't be certain how the higher rate environment will impact these maturities or issuers' likelihood to deliver, we're confident that this puts us in a strong position to achieve the ratings revenue targets were outlining today for 2024. Now turning to our initial guidance for 2024. This slide illustrates our initial guidance for GAAP results. For adjusted guidance, we're expecting revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%, driven by strong growth in all five divisions."", ""We expect organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures, in the range of 7% to 9%. We expect to deliver at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024. This will require us to maintain discipline around expenses and productivity while ensuring that we're making the necessary investments to drive growth and innovation in vital strategic areas, like generative AI, sustainability, energy transition, and private markets. We expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.75 to $14, which represents double-digit growth at the midpoint."", ""It's important to note that our expected adjusted tax rate is nearly two percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2023. If our tax rate were to remain unchanged from 2023, we would expect adjusted EPS growth approximately 2 to 3 percentage points higher, consistent with the low to mid-teens growth rate we pointed to for 2025/2026 at our investor day. As you saw in our supplemental materials earlier this morning, we also expect adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of approximately $4.4 billion. We expect growth in adjusted free cash flow to be driven primarily by strong growth in revenue and profitability, though free cash flow growth will be tempered somewhat by the timing of working capital items and the full-year impact of the $750 million debt offering completed in the third quarter of 2023."", ""With the geopolitical, macroeconomic, and market risks and opportunities we've discussed on this call, we expect that the financial outlook we've provided today likely has more upside risk than downside, and you can count on our focus, determination, and discipline over the coming year. Our outlook for 2024 calls for further acceleration in revenue growth compared to 2023 and continued margin expansion, even though we will no longer have the benefit of the vast majority of our cost synergy actions going forward. Our financial outlook for 2024 illustrates our continued progress toward the targets we outlined at our investor day just over a year ago, and we remain committed to those targets. Moving to our division outlook."", 'For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5% with expected growth to be slightly higher in the back half than in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 33.5% to 34.5% as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives while maintaining rigorous discipline around expenses. For Ratings, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, driven by build issuance growth of 3% to 7%. We expect revenue growth rates to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half as comparisons are easier in the first half, and we expect some level of pull forward given the uncertainty around the timing of any potential rate actions by central banks.', 'We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9.5% and adjusted operating margins of 46.5% to 47.5%. For Mobility, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10% and adjusted operating margins of 39% to 40%. Lastly, for S&P Dow Jones Indices, we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% and adjusted operating margins in the range of 68.5% to 69.5%.', ""As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, our board has authorized the repurchase of shares totaling up to $2.4 billion, which we expect to execute throughout the year. And with that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, president of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and executive lead for Sustainable1 to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions."", 'Mark Grant -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Thank you, Doug. [Operator instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our first question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.', 'Faiza Alwy -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to start with a big-picture question on Ratings, take advantage of Martina on the call.', ""Maybe you can talk a little bit about the drivers behind the Ratings top-line outlook. Doug mentioned 3% to 7% build issuance growth but give us a bit more color around transaction versus non-transaction growth and the various components, whether it's corporate, structured. You mentioned greater private assessment, so just a bit more color around what's underlying the revenue outlook. Thank you."", 'Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global Ratings', ""Hi. Thanks very much for the question. So as Doug mentioned in his remarks, we do expect a stronger first half of this year, 2024 compared to the back half of the year, and I'll break it down a little bit. First on the transaction revenue and our build issuance estimate in the 3% to 7%, we're expecting to see continued refinancing activity that we saw build up in the back half of last year with high-yielding bank loans, and we saw that consistent in January."", ""So we would expect to see that continue throughout the first half of this year. We would also expect to see some investment grade although not as robust as last year, and part of that is just because so many investment-grade issuers tapped the market last year. And other potential factor there is the fact that we would see some investment-grade issuers being able to wait until the rates come down. Now some of the factors driving first half versus the second half, I would say, anecdotally, we're hearing that issuers are looking to come to market to take advantage of strong investor appetite to lock in rates once they're higher and before the rates come down and ahead of potential volatility in the back half of the year."", ""On transaction revenue, we would actually expect to see stronger frequent issuer program issuance this year than we saw last year. You won't see that in our build issuance estimate, for example, and we would also expect to see continued strong performance in our surveillance book across CRISIL, our royalty and other products, such as res or ratings evaluation service. Overall, though, as Doug said, we do expect stronger first half compared to second half. All of these factors that we take into consideration, including pace and timing of rate cuts, volatility, etc., these are all baked into our overall outlook."", ""It is early in the year, and we will definitely seek to become more precise as we go throughout the year. But that's, I think, a good summary of where we're at."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.', 'Manav Patnaik -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on the revenue synergies, and you said I think it was $152 million annualized exiting the year. I think that's a number higher than what we would have thought."", ""I was just hoping you could give us some color on where -- what kind of areas those are coming from, what you've kind of baked into 2024 also perhaps."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Manav. This is Doug. Well, we're really excited about what we've been able to achieve with the merger. And you've heard us talk about the power of the merger, the capital return that we had, the accretion to EPS, the cost synergies, which we now have delivered $619 million."", ""And going forward, we're going to keep talking about the revenue synergies. When we look at the revenue synergies, they started off traditionally with cross-sell within divisions. This is where we were selling Commodity Insights products from the Platts customers to the IHS Markit customers and vice versa, same in the Market Intelligence business where we're selling financial services products to corporate customers for Market Intelligence. But now we're starting to deliver the new products as well, and a combination of both of these has allowed us to be ahead of the schedule."", ""We're very excited about the new products coming out. Let me give you one example from the Commodity Insights division, something called Platts Connect. Platts Connect is a product that took the platform of Platts Dimensions Pro and took the IHS Markit Connect platform. We put them together."", ""We now have a very unique single holistic platform for prices, for research, for forecasting. But let me hand it over to Adam since he's on the call and he can give us some more color for Market Intelligence."", 'Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market Intelligence', 'Great. Thanks, Doug. The revenue synergy is obviously one of the most exciting parts of the combination of businesses. As Doug mentioned, the early successes have been in going to our customers with combined product capabilities that strengthen what we were already providing to those customers.', ""We've seen outsized performance there, even against our own expectations. What's really exciting as we get now into the years where we've landed those early merger synergies is the launch of new products. Doug mentioned a few. Over the course of 2023, we launched seven new products just within Market Intelligence."", ""We have 14 new products set to come to market across 2024. These will increasingly become part of what we're offering out to customers, whether it's just putting our bond pricing in, together with our credit analytics capability, looking at our economics and country risk data across our desktop, incorporating sustainability data into our private markets portfolio management capabilities. These are all exciting areas that will continue to add to the growth of the business. You'll also see us announce some increasing generative AI capabilities across broader data sets of the combined businesses."", ""I'm sure we'll talk a little bit more about that later on the call."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question --', 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Manav.', 'Operator', 'I apologize. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Greg Parrish -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Hey, good morning, this is Greg Parrish on for Toni. Thanks for taking our question. Adam, I just want to go back to you. Talk about Market Intelligence 6% or 7.5% revenue growth guide, similar to last year.', ""Is a -- selling environment, has that improved at all or is that still a bit of a headwind? And then on the capital markets piece of the business, I think some of the Ipreo assets seeing some increased activity to start the year. So is there upside from that or you're still a little bit cautious? Thanks."", 'Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market Intelligence', ""OK. Thank you for the call. We're very optimistic about continued growth in the business, and you've seen that progression from '22 to '23, and you see our guidance for 2024. Our end markets have had a pretty challenged period through '22 and '23, right? You've seen 30-plus percent declines in M&A activity, 34% decline in private equity investment activity."", ""But even through that period, we've been able to deliver the solutions that our customers want. I think that will continue into '24. We do see some early activity in capital markets, but I think the way the full year will play out is yet to be seen. For us, going into the first quarter, we see more challenging comps."", ""So we'll see a little bit slower start to the year than we'll see toward the back half of the year. I am cautiously optimistic that as market stabilize, that presents opportunity for us, but we want to be careful because our largest customer sets continue to be under pressure. You see that in the news every day. As we go into the beginning part of this year, we want to see how that ultimately plays out, but we feel we feel pretty good about the guidance range we've put out."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Greg.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may proceed.', 'Tom Roesch -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. This is Tom on for Andrew. I wanted to ask about Chat IQ.', ""You mentioned you started piloting that in December. I was wondering what kind of customer feedback you're getting so far and what kind of benefits you can expect. Can it help increase pricing on the Cap IQ platform or any other benefits you are seeing there? Thank you."", 'Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market Intelligence', ""Tom, thanks for the question. We're very excited about the early responses on Chat IQ. That's a tool that lets our customers get into our desktop and get back actionable insights, lets them actually click through directly down to the source documents on what's one of the most robust data sets available to financial markets and corporate participants in the world. Chat IQ, very exciting."", ""We are out with a few pilot customers. We'll start to release that out more broadly to our customer set over the course of 2024, but it's also not the only thing that we're doing with generative AI. You may have seen a press release in the last couple of days. We've actually launched now widely available to customers the ability to use generative AI to search in the S&P Global Marketplace, which is the place where you can go and look at all the data sets available across all of S&P Global."", ""We're using generative AI to allow people to query into those data sets to get broader understanding of what's actually available through our company. We're pretty excited about that, and early responses have been positive. You'll also see releases from us during the year of things we're calling REGGPT, some other tools around our Ratings-related data that we deliver through Market Intelligence to allow our customers to probe into that data and get quick responses that help increase the speed within their own workflows. You'll continue to see this across the course of 2024."", ""We're very focused on making sure we release things that are actually useful to our customers, enhance the value proposition of what we're delivering to them, and ultimately, embed our solutions more deeply into their workflows."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Tom.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.', 'Alex Hess -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi, everybody. This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I was hoping you guys could walk us through a little bit of the incremental margin outlooks embedded in your guide, especially for Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights, sort of -- and maybe Mobility. Would just sort of helpful to know sort of in those higher subscription businesses what the puts and takes are on expenses and how we should see that flowing through to operating income.', 'Thank you.', 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Alex. This is Doug. Let me start by saying that we always start our year with looking at how we're going to be able to grow our margins. We always build a budget that begins with top-line growth, and we want to make sure that we can build our business through investment for innovation but also continue to deliver margin expansion."", ""So you asked about each of the divisions, and each of the divisions has different characteristics for how we're moving forward. We have technology and productivity plans in place. But let me start with a couple of the divisions and then hand it over to Adam. So within the Commodity Insights division, we're looking at, as you saw, 8.8% growth to 9.5% growth with a margin expansion into 46.5% to 47.5% range."", 'We have growth in that area, in particular in energy transition products. We see high demand coming for new sorts of products that relate to carbon, to carbon intensity, to carbon markets, to different types of metals which are going to be important for the energy transition. So we see a lot of growth in the area coming from energy transition on top of what are the regular markets there. We do have some investments taking place in the Commodity Insights division, both for some regional expansion, as well as some new products.', ""When it comes to Mobility, we're making some investments in some new products in Mobility so that we will be able to grow our top line. As you see, we have an 8.5% to 10% revenue guide as a 39% to 40% margin guide. But we always operate all of our businesses beginning with top line, with discipline to deliver growth. Just to mention, before I hand it over to Adam, as you know, we've delivered 1,200 basis points of margin expansion over the last 10 years, so it's something that's in our DNA."", 'But let me hand it over to Adam.', 'Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market Intelligence', ""Sure. And just commenting briefly on margins within Market Intelligence, we do expect to continue to see expansion as we go into 2024. It's important for us to keep balancing the need for continued efficiency, looking for where we can operate more effectively and continue to drive margin expansion. We expect to do that on course to the levels that we laid out in the 2022 investor day but also balancing that with making the right investments to drive the increased top-line growth that we also expect to deliver as we get toward those target dates that we laid out in the investor day as well."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Alex.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed.', 'Alex Kramm -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just I guess continuing that last point, Adam, that you made. When I look at the revenue targets that you laid out at the investor day across the company, I think you're making good progress everywhere."", ""But in Market Intelligence, I think we -- it appears that if it's a steady path, we're the most behind. So maybe just coming back to the comments you made earlier in terms of the environment, is it the environment that needs to improve? Is it the revenue synergies that need to click more? Or what needs to happen to get to that 7% to 9% in 2025? Yeah, and what are the biggest factor that gets you there? Thanks. And what's your confidence level, sorry?"", 'Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market Intelligence', ""Thanks, Alex. Confidence level, high. We set those targets for 2025/2026. I think we're well on track to get there."", ""Even in this current year while coming in behind our goal, we're still right near the very bottom of that 7% to 9% growth range, right? We delivered at 6.9-or-so percent year. You've seen in our guidance, we'll continue to push toward that. You identified, actually, a couple of the important factors. That synergy growth will continue to build, and we always said we'd start to see the real impact of that in years three through five."", ""And that's the period that we're just starting to enter. So you will see that continue to be a factor. The second biggest factor is we've gone through, in 2022 and 2023, one of the toughest macro environments that we've seen, particularly for our customers over the last certainly five to 10 years. So as that macroenvironment improves, structural conditions for that customer set improves for us, it also sets us up to continue to accelerate toward those growth levels."", ""Even through that challenging period, as I mentioned, we're delivering actually pretty close to that range and on a pretty straight line path into it and have pretty high confidence that we'll get there."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Alex.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.', 'Ashish Sabadra -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus -- or drill down further on the index business. There was a mention of declines in OTC products. I was wondering if you could provide some color on that front.', ""And then as we get into 2024, I was wondering if you could provide some color on what are your assumptions around the AUM growth? And then fees, which were a headwind this year, how should we think about those potentially becoming a tailwind in '24? Thanks."", 'Ewout Steenbergen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Good morning, Ashish. This is Ewout. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to answer a question during my last call. Coming back to your point about the OTC, obviously, if you look at AUM fees in the fourth quarter, you say, hey, that's strange."", ""Why is it flat where markets are up so much? And we see two underlying dynamics that go in opposite direction. So as we have always said, in AUM fees, there's many things that go there into the mix. There is mutual funds. There's OTCs and others."", ""Actually, if you zoom in on ETFs, it's up about. 8% in terms of fees. And that is helped by market appreciation, as well as very strong inflows that we have seen into the ETF area but offset by OTC volumes that were down period over period. OTC volumes can always be a bit lumpy quarter to quarter, so I wouldn't read too much into."", 'This can really change again the following quarter. So overall, I would say this is a normal trend that we are seeing here. With respect to the assumptions for 2024, first of all, the assumption is that AUM is up mid-single digit level; the ETD volumes, low single-digit increase; and then the subscription growth at a double-digit level for the index business for 2024. Those are the assumptions.', 'Thank you, Ashish.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.', 'Scott Wurtzel -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Great. Thank you, and good morning, guys. Just moving back to the Ratings segment and thinking about the results and guidance here. Sort of looking at that Slide 32 and seeing the decline in expected maturities for 2024, we're just wondering if you guys saw any pull-forward activity into the fourth quarter given the decline in rates and tightening spreads that we saw and how that may have informed your outlook for 2024 here? Thanks."", 'Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global Ratings', ""Hey, Scott. Thanks for the question. We did see some pull forward more for '24, a little bit of '25 into 2023, not just in Q4, I would say. I mean, I think the sort of the repricing and other refinancing activity started to pick up momentum in the back half overall, and we've certainly seen that continue into this year."", ""But I would maybe take a step back and perhaps sort of characterize how we build our outlook for the year. So absolutely, refinancing is very important. And as Doug mentioned in his remarks, the refinancing wall continues to grow nicely, which is a very healthy indicator for us. But we also look at a number of other factors, including the overall macro picture, whether it's GDP growth, pace, and timing of interest rate cuts."", ""We also look at opportunistic issuance. We know that's been historically very hard to predict, and that's become even more difficult in the last two years. And candidly, M&A, we don't have historic -- or heroic assumptions around M&A. As Adam mentioned earlier, it was down quite a bit last year."", ""And while we're hearing a little bit of positive market sentiment, we need to see how that plays out throughout the course of the year. We also look at investor appetite, fund flows, and how that could impact issuance across different asset classes. So for example, as I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see higher frequent issuer/issuance this year than we did last year, and then we keep an eye on this throughout the course of the year. A lot of contacts with investors."", ""I think we did -- we increased our investor meeting frequency quite a bit last year. So we're between the 25,000, 30,000 range of meetings with investors. So a lot of work goes into building up the bond up, not just the refinancing piece of it. Although, of course, that's a good long-term indicator for us."", ""And then just to -- as a kind of recap or draw a line under it, as Doug said, we'd expect slightly faster first half than the second half. Then as we go throughout the year, we can come back to you with greater precision."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Scott.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.', 'Jeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Thanks so much. In your prepared remarks, I think you had said you're constantly reviewing and optimizing your portfolio. Can we just kind of step back? Maybe you can tell us what you're looking for, whether it's in tuck-in acquisitions or maybe more importantly potential divestitures, would it be possible to see a large divestiture in the future? Thanks."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Jeff. As you know, we always apply a discipline to looking at our portfolio, looking at top-line growth, looking at the margin expansion, also looking at how it fits across the portfolio. During the year last year, we didn't make a lot of noise about it, but we did shut down some very small products. We shut down 8,000 indices that were subpar subsize across the businesses within Commodity Insights, Market Intelligence."", ""There's some small products that we moved on. We also had a couple of small divestitures. But when you ask the question to us, we're constantly looking at the portfolio, trying to understand what fits best. We have different themes."", ""You've heard us talk about the key themes, private market, sustainability, supply chain analytics, risk, and credit. These are the sorts of areas that we're always looking to expand our presence to make sure we have the best capabilities possible to meet the needs of our clients. But within looking at the needs of clients, we look at the shareholders. We look at how we're going to put this portfolio together with the best way to leverage our technology."", ""We will always apply the discipline as well to how we're going to look at the portfolio in the future. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'George Tong -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to better understand your guidance for Ratings revenue growth in 2024."", 'You expect to build debt issuance growth of 3% to 7% but Ratings revenue growth of only 6 to 8% in 2024, which would reflect little to no pricing benefit or mix headwinds. Can you help bridge the gap there?', 'Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global Ratings', 'Yeah. Hi, George. Thanks for the question. So maybe I could start with how transaction versus non-transaction and how we think about both of those.', ""And as you know, transaction is a somewhat lower proportion of our revenues compared to, let's say, pre-pandemic. On the transaction front and specific to build issuance, as I said in my last response, we look at a variety of factors. Refinancing is a critical one, covered that in my last response, as well as the key macro drivers when rates -- run rate cuts could start, for example, what the exit rate on those looks like this year, the potential challenge in predicting opportunistic issuance. And there, we really do not have heroic assumptions around opportunistic issuance for this year, so we're being cautious on that."", ""And then I would say, as I mentioned as well, that we would expect to see more frequent issuer/issuance this year, which wouldn't show up in our build issuance estimate of 3% to 7%. So I think with all of that, you have to take into consideration the potential wide range of outcomes, whether it's rates, whether it's almost half the world's population voting in elections, and potential for greater volatility in the back half of the year. So that informs both the overall outlook of 3% to 7% build issuance but also the timing that Doug has mentioned, which is a stronger first half versus second half. On the transaction side, we see strong performance across all key areas there."", 'So that would include our surveillance book. It would include the res portions of the book, for example, CRISIL, as well as the royalty payment that we get from Market Intelligence. So maybe again, I would just reiterate strong first half and tapering off in the back half. And then as Doug mentioned, it is early in the year.', 'There is potential for upside in the range, and we would look to get more precise on this as we go throughout the year.', 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, George.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may proceed.', 'Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst', 'Yes, hi. Good morning. Maybe just talk a little bit further about your guidance for the year about where potentially you could be conservative in your mind, whether it be on the cost side of things or are you baking in too much assumption for costs there or on the top line, what segments potentially come out ahead of your outlook at this stage of the game? Thank you.', 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Craig. As you saw, when we put together our information, we put in our slides what are the key factors that we look at. And when you take a step back, we know that GDP growth is always the No. 1 driver.', ""It's the highest correlated factor to our long-term revenue growth. We've looked over the years to see what are those factors that drive it the most. We see some potential slowdown in the economy in the U.S. and EU."", ""We're planning for what we call -- we're planning against what we call a soft landing, which means that there could be some sort of slowdown in the economy. As you heard, we've seen some slowness and a little bit of longer sales cycles in certain segments, but that's -- those are some of the downside factors. What would happen with the geopolitical factors, how long will it take before central banks begin to cut rates, we've taken those into account as we built our guidance with some conservatism. So if we saw a much quicker return to lower interest rates, if we saw much quicker in geopolitical environment that was more stable, these are the kinds of things that create some upside for the company."", ""We also look at segment by segment. We know that the automotive segment is going through a lot of change. We know that the energy transition which is changing the commodity cycle. So we've taken into account all of these different factors as we've looked at the overall -- at the guidance."", ""So to your upside risk -- with upside opportunities, we think that it could come if interest rates move down lower faster if the interest rates -- if the economies grow faster than we think, etc. But these are all the factors we take into account across the divisions as we're setting up our guidance for 2024. Thanks, Craig."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.', 'John Mazzoni -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning. Could you just help us understand how you're thinking about the longer-term generative AI monetization, specifically around cross-platforming, as well as potential kind of upsell and cross-sell from kind of new products? Thanks."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Great. Thank you for that. And when we think about technology and we think about AI, we start with the framework that we showed you in our prepared remarks today, which has a foundation of very strong proprietary data. We think that this is going to be one of the most important factors for AI becoming successful at any company no matter where they are.', ""And we think that this gives us a running start, in addition to what we've already been developing with Kensho over the last five years. But turning that into earnings and turning that into growth is something that we're starting to build. We think that the AI opportunities we have, Adam talked earlier about Chat IQ is an example of something that gives customers the opportunity to dig much, much deeper into our data, we think that it's going to create stickiness. We're starting with metrics that look at, for example, our Net Promoter Scores."", ""We're looking at retention. We're looking at how people -- how -- what kind of feedback we get from calls from customers that are calling in to see how we're doing. We also believe that, right now, we're going to be able to continue to meet our guidance that we gave you in our investor day in 2022. We'll be able to continue along that track, and then we'll be able to come out with much more precise guidance for the impact of AI across our portfolio in the future."", ""But we see this as something that's going to be a game changer for all of our businesses. It's going to be embedded in everything we do, and we're just now learning how we're going to measure those impacts. But let me hand it over to Adam because he's very close to a couple of the in-market opportunities that we have right now."", 'Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market Intelligence', ""Great. Thanks, Doug, and thank you for the question. As Doug mentioned, we do think generative AI has a transformative potential across almost all of our products. Remember, we are one of the largest data providers in the world, and the one thing we have is a highly trusted, highly developed accurate set of data across our businesses, whether that's in Market Intelligence or the other divisions of our business."", ""We're also deeply embedded in the workflows of our customers. The combination of those two and when you really understand the power behind generative AI to unlock the potential in massive data sets that may correlate to each other, may have unique insights, and the ability to process through that in a very rapid time frame, for us thinking about portfolio monitoring workflows, research and insights, credit assessments, risk assessment, looking across broad sets of data for insights and what's developing in various sectors or regions or how it could impact a portfolio, those are all opportunities for us for making the data sets and workflows that we already provide today to our customers all the more powerful. When we look at the opportunity set in front of us and even just our product launch sheet for 2024, we're pretty encouraged that we're well-positioned to take advantage of the technology, increase the penetration we have with our customers, and expand the kinds of services and insights we're able to give them efficiently that also increases the efficiency of their own internal workflows, which, obviously, comes with significant value. We'll see how that all materializes and how we're able to monetize that, but we do think it's a tailwind for us."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, John.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.', 'Jeff Meuler -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""Yeah, thank you. Ewout, when you described some of the costs that were higher than expected, things like the HIS -- the heritage IHS Markit, employee benefit cost, it wasn't clear to me. Was there a true-up that was specific to Q4? or was there a greater-than-expected step-up in the expense baseline that's happening now? And then on '24 tax rate, what drives the step-up? And is the new rate kind of like a good steady-state rate for the portfolio? Thank you."", 'Ewout Steenbergen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. So let me explain what is benefits realignment. So benefits realignment is that we brought as of January 1, 2023, all of our employees across the world do the same benefits package because we think it is fair that we should treat everyone the same in every country around the world, so think about the medical plans, think about the retirement plans.', 'We have made estimates about the expenses for 2023. And for the first three quarters, the expenses came in exactly in line with our expectations, but they exceeded the expectations in the fourth quarter. And benefits costs are always not 100% certain because, just to give an example, the medical costs in the U.S. were self-insured, so they can be higher if we have higher medical claims or the matching for 401(k) contributions can be higher.', 'So we are seeing this more as a one-time step-up cost, and that should be in our baseline going forward from 2024 onwards. Your second part of your question about the tax rate. We saw in a bit of a benefit in the tax rate in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and then we are seeing some upward pressure in the tax rate in 2024. So to expand on that, on the third quarter of 2023, we had some favorable new guidance with respect to the utilization of foreign tax credits.', 'And then in the fourth quarter, we had the conclusion of certain state tax audits that led to some reserve releases, so it brought the effective tax rate a little bit down in 2023 compared to a normalized level. And what we are seeing in 2024, the implementation of Pillar 2 global minimum tax in several jurisdictions, as well as the U.K. statutory tax rate is going up So 2024 is I think the right level to think about this. Where tax rate will go from a longer-term perspective is really hard to say because it really depends on government finances and where that will go around the world in the future.', 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Jeff.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. You may proceed.', 'Russell Quelch -- Redburn Partners -- Analyst', 'Yeah, hi. Thanks for having me on the call. Sorry to go back to this. But on the Ratings business, your macro forecasts are implying what I think is just soft-landing conducive for rate cuts.', ""And as I understand it, the maturity wall was built throughout the year. I appreciate some of that could be pulled forward into the front end, but I'm still struggling to square this sort of front-end-loaded observation when you discuss revenues relative to your macro guidance. So maybe you could explain that again please and also what you're assuming for the non-transactional revenue growth in '24. Sorry if I missed that."", 'Thanks.', 'Martina Cheung -- President, S&P Global Ratings', ""Thanks so much, Russell, for the question. Just a quick one on the non-transaction, we don't separate out our guidance between transaction and non-transaction. But as I said, we do expect robust performance in our non-transaction part of the book this year. The picture is a little counterintuitive, in fact, for the timing piece because you would, in fact, expect given our economist predictions of three rate cuts, for example, by the fed starting in the middle of the year this year that you might see a more even result with issuance throughout the year."", ""What we're actually hearing from the market is a little bit different. So for bank loans and high yield, for example, we're seeing and hearing a couple of things. Number one, issuers have accepted higher for longer. But more importantly, number two, there's a good -- really good strong investor appetite for these asset classes."", ""And pricing is much more constructive this year, for example, than it was the same time last year. So these issuers are coming to market. There's a high volume of repricing into that. So for example, the bank loan January volumes for repricing was actually around -- if not a little bit higher than the full-year 2023 repricing that we saw in bank loans."", ""And then on investment grade, some of that -- we see that tapered a little bit this year compared to last year. The reason for that is that there were so many issuers that came to market last year but also those that are sitting waiting for rate cuts can afford to actually absorb what they're sitting on today, whether it's using commercial paper or otherwise to wait for some of those rate cuts to play out. Hopefully, that answers your question. As I said, it's early."", ""We're in the first half of February, and this is our base case. There's a pretty wide range of possibilities here, and we'll look to get much more precise as we go throughout the year."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Russell.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.', 'Adam Parrington -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'Hi. This is Adam on for Shlomo. Can you discuss the level of incentive compensation in the quarter and what is implied in 2024 versus 2023? And how much does this impact the margin guidance for 2024 as well? Thank you.', 'Ewout Steenbergen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. We brought up incentive compensation accruals in the fourth quarter, and that was driven by the strong top-line performance from both Ratings and Commodity Insights. So for the total year 2023, our cash bonus incentive? Accruals are now ending up at a level above 100%. What we always do when we do planning is to reset cash bonus incentives back to 100% from a planning perspective for the next year.', 'So for 2024 in the plan is embedded 100% payout of our cash bonuses.', 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Adam.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Emily Marzo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hi, this is Emily Marzo on for Heather Balsky. You talked about elevated cancellations in Market Intelligence. Could you give us some details on what type and maybe size of customers you are seeing canceled and what kind of discussions you've had so far this year?"", 'Adam Kansler -- President, S&P Global Market Intelligence', ""Hi, Heather. It's Adam. Thank you for the question. So through the fourth quarter, in particular, the places where we saw cancellations were actually in our smallest customers, right, customers under relatively low threshold."", 'Our larger customers, while under pressure due to a range of macro reasons, those are places where we have opportunity in a vendor consolidation initiative where those customers are looking to consolidate the number of vendors they work with. Given the scale and scope of relationship that they have with S&P Global, that often presents opportunity for us. And accordingly, we saw much stronger renewal rates in that group of customers than we did among our smallest customers. I think the other places where we see pressure is discretionary spend, where customers have a decision whether to undertake a consulting project or a new initiative.', ""Those are places where customers have been a little bit more hesitant into the fourth quarter, and we're hopeful that will continue to stabilize as we get into 2024."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'We will now take our final question from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.', 'Owen Lau -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. I just want to go back to AI. And I think AI, it's great, and there are lots of potential."", ""But it looks like where the clients will actually pay extra for it, it's still uncertain. I'm just wondering what makes you confident that you can develop a killer app that people will use it and pay for it. Thanks."", 'Doug Peterson -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Owen. Well, we take a view that AI is going to be embedded in everything we do, and we don't think there's going to be a killer app. It'd be great if there were, but that's not our plan. Our plan is to look at AI to see how it can improve our productivity, how we can use it with our developers, our data management, data linking, etc., up into how we're going to improve our products and build products and link them over time."", ""As you heard from Adam, we've got a few very exciting products that are already being tested in the market. We've launched one recently, and then we've got some more coming. We also have the capabilities of Kensho which are available on the marketplace. So we don't think of it as a killer app."", ""We think of it as continuous improvement. And we think that if you look at it over time, it's going to be something that's going to change the way we work and the way that our people work, so we're really excited about it. We're also excited that we have such a strong internal team, that we're one of the first companies who was able to name a chief artificial intelligence officer, somebody who has the experience of Kensho, of being the CEO there with the expertise. We have an open model in terms of the ecosystem we're going to be working with."", ""So we're not looking for a killer app, but we're looking to see every single way we can use it and how it's going to improve the way we serve our customers, as well to manage the business. So thank you, Owen. Let me make a couple of closing remarks. And first of all, I want to thank all of you, as usual, for being on the call and for your excellent questions."", ""And it was great to have Adam and Martina on the call today. And I'm really excited about everything that we're able to deliver in 2023. We delivered what we think is the promise of the merger. As you know, we've paid back over $17.5 billion of capital over the last two years since the merger."", ""We've been delivering innovation. We delivered on our synergies, so we're excited about taking that energy and all of the incredible work that our people have done and turning that now into growth into the future. I also want to thank our people. As always for their incredible work."", ""It's what made 2023 what it is, and it's what makes me very confident about the foundation we have for going forward and especially our leadership team who is focused on growth, innovation, execution. This is our last earnings call with Ewout. He's been with us for seven years of remarkable service, and I want to thank him. He's helped shape our financial strategy."", ""I know that everybody is very pleased with our margin and as well as our capital return, and that's something Ewout has been instrumental in. He's helped us lead with our accelerated growth, with our innovation. And he's had a tremendous impact. He partnered with us on all of the major strategic transactions."", ""He's been the sponsor of Kensho for the last five years, which we now talked about many times on this call the importance that brings to the company, as well as one of the initial architects as well as executors of the IHS Markit merger. So he's done a fantastic job, building a world-class finance organization. As we previously announced, our current chief accounting officer, Chris Craig, will be named as the interim CFO on Monday, and he has done a fantastic job here for the last 13 years. And he's going to continue to evaluate the businesses and as we look at both internally and externally for candidates for the permanent role, and I look forward to working with Chris in his in his role."", ""But again, thank you, Ewout. We wish you the best in your new role and continued success in your career, and please keep making the world a better place with your leadership with UNICEF.

That’s according to analysis by research firm Gartner, which says smartphone makers will ship some 240 million generative AI smartphones in 2024, while AI PC vendors will ship 54.5 million units in the year.', '“The rapid adoption of on-device GenAI capabilities and AI processors will eventually become a standard requirement for technology vendors,” Gartner senior director analyst Ranjit Atwal said in a statement.', '“This ubiquity will pose challenges for vendors in differentiating themselves from competitors, making it harder to create unique selling points and drive increased revenues.”', 'AI PCs are laptops and desktops outfitted with neural processing units, or NPUs, that are specifically designed to handle AI tasks such as generative AI apps. Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) offer, or are preparing to offer, chips with built-in NPUs designed to slot into some of the latest PCs on the market.', 'In the case of Intel, that includes systems with its Core Ultra line of chips, which are currently only found in premium laptops in the $900 and up range.', 'AI smartphones, meanwhile, are smartphones with processors, and neural engines, powerful enough to run on-device AI tasks. Google’s Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, as well as Samsung’s S24 line of smartphones, are some of the first to get the AI smartphone label.', 'While the number of AI devices is still relatively limited now, Gartner says they’ll eventually account for 22% of all PC shipments and 22% of basic and premium smartphone shipments by the end of the year. That’s up from 1% of smartphone shipments and 10% of PC shipments in 2023.', 'There’s just one problem: There’s still no truly impressive use case for either AI PCs or AI smartphones that makes them worth buying over their counterparts. The inherent improvement you get from a new generation of PC chips is why you’d likely buy an Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm-equipped laptop or desktop rather than because they have an NPU.', 'And you’d probably opt for a Samsung or Google smartphone because you prefer their overall features rather than because they’re marketed as AI smartphones.', 'The main selling point for these devices, so far, is that they can perform some generative AI tasks locally rather than having to rely on cloud services. That means your data is kept on your PC or smartphone instead of sent to the cloud. That provides some security and privacy advantages, because your information doesn’t have to travel across the web.', 'But being able to run an AI image generator app or ChatGPT-like program on your PC or smartphone isn’t exactly an exciting, marketable feature. That goes especially for PCs, because they’ll already come with Microsoft’s cloud-based Copilot AI software built directly into Windows. If you’ve got that, why do you need an AI PC?', 'PC chipmakers, in particular, are frank about the fact that they’re waiting on developers to come up with new killer apps that take advantage of on-board generative AI capabilities to entice consumers to buy AI PCs.', 'According to Atwal, AI PC and smartphone functionality won’t drive device sales until around 2027 as more AI-based capabilities hit the market. For smartphones, he said, that will mean a device that has a far deeper understanding of your needs.', 'So why will AI PC and AI smartphone sales take off this year? Because consumers are going to start replacing the devices they purchased at the start of the pandemic, and many of those will be AI PCs and AI smartphones, because those capabilities are available on the best tech.', 'Eventually, though, AI PCs and AI smartphones will offer unique features that their non-AI siblings won’t be able to run.', '“This evolution will transform smartphones into even more intuitive companions capable of comprehending and responding to human language and visual cues, which will elevate the overall user experience to new heights,” Atwal explained.', 'For now, the AI PC and AI smartphone revolution is still in its early stages.

First of all, I just want to acknowledge the news that I will be stepping down in May as CEO after my contract ends and will be passing the baton to Ariane Gorin, who currently heads our Expedia for Business. As many of you know, when I started this unexpected journey during COVID, travel was at a standstill. Money was flowing out of the company faster than we could replace it. And our people, our shareholders and most of the world were unsure how and when we would ever come back. Strangely, those days never really worried me. Maybe I'm an optimist, but I always believed we'd get back to life and travel would follow. While you might assume that COVID was the defining part of my tenure, in reality, we quickly saw an opportunity to use our COVID time to embark on one of the most audacious and ambitious transformations, I think, a company of our size has ever attempted. It was always my hope that we would finish this massive test by now, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that was sometimes in doubt. We had many fits and starts as we took on this massive overhaul. But when you do something as bold as we were attempting, you have to be prepared to deal with some mess. And as much as anything, I'm proud that we were not afraid of the mess and we pushed through. And as the work began to accelerate in the back half of last year, I could finally see that we would, in fact, meet my timetable. Over the last 4 years, we built a tremendous team, who, in turn, accomplished amazing things. I have to say that what started in an unlikely and difficult way turned out to be one of the most compelling and challenging opportunities of my career. Now I'm not going anywhere yet, and I intend to sprint through the finish line on the way out. Among my important tasks between now and then is ensuring an absolutely seamless transition to Ariane and making sure none of our team misses a beat. I just want to say that I've had the pleasure of working with Ariane closely for the last 4 years, and I believe she is a terrific choice to take the company forward and build on what we have created. She is a seasoned leader with a very successful track record at Expedia Group, including most recently as head of our market-leading B2B business. I look forward to working with Ariane over the next few months, and I will not be going far as I return to my perch as Vice Chairman. Now that I've addressed that, let's move on to our results. I was generally very pleased with our performance in '23. We met our guidance despite what was a year of tremendous change. It is really difficult to fully appreciate the breadth of change and the volatility that such change can create. We've discussed this many times. But when you have to willingly take steps backward to go forward, you create a lot of inherent unpredictability. And yet despite that, we delivered and landed the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong revenue and EBITDA performance. But we did see some softness in gross bookings driven primarily by air, which in turn was largely driven by a reduction in average ticket prices. As you all know, air does not impact revenue or profitability very much. But it does have an outsized impact on our overall gross bookings. While air has been showing some signs of macro softening, we continue to improve our air product with new AI-driven features and pricing capabilities. And like many areas of our business, we see significant opportunity to grow regardless of any macro headwinds. Our lodging business held up very well and had yet another record quarter with our hotel gross bookings growing 13% year-over-year. Vrbo finished its planned front-end migration in Q4 and suffered expected conversion degradation. But it now has more tests running than ever in its history, and we are clawing back conversion at a breakneck pace. We also cut back last year on Vrbo marketing in concert with the expected conversion degradation but are now really excited about our new brand work that is designed to punch our main competitor squarely in the nose, and we are leaning back into spend. There's a bit of lag effect as we ramp back up, but we are excited to get Vrbo back on offense with the product improving every day, the impact from improved and increased marketing and, of course, our secret weapon in One Key, whose effect will only continue to build. We did an awful lot in '23 from the launch of One Key to the completion of the Vrbo migration from the plumbing of machine learning and AI into more and more of our customer experience to the launch of ChatGPT-assisted trip planning. But more important than any win in '23 is the sheer magnitude of change we have driven since we embarked on our transformation journey at the beginning of 2020. Over this period, we rationalized investments in over 20 brands to 3 or fewer in every region. We eliminated dependency on 76 different agencies around the globe and instead built an entire full-service marketing, creative and media-buying team internally. We consolidated all performance marketing into one group with unified data and tools, allowing us to optimize across brands and bring programmatic approaches to everything we do in metasearch, social, SEO and everywhere else. And we fundamentally shifted the business from transactional web arbitrage to app first, focused on acquiring and retaining the customers with the highest LTV and return on investment. On the tech side, we decommissioned 17 CRM systems and built one universal messaging platform linking all brands. We went from 7 different loyalty stacks to One Key. We consolidated from 13 machine learning platforms and 4 experimentation platforms to one. We converted 300 million customer data profiles into one common identity platform. We have meaningfully reduced the number of developer tools and optimized our IT footprint. And most importantly, all our brands are now on a single front-end stack with a unified test-and-learn platform that gives us the ability to rapidly launch tests and features across brands, platforms and geos. It is hard to fully conceptualize how much we have changed, but perhaps one simple way is to double-click on how all these elements allow us to massively accelerate our test-and-learn capability and drive faster feature deployment and better performance in the product. Our unified front end now allows us to deploy features around the globe and on any brand at a pace we could not contemplate just a couple of years ago. What used to take months, even years, now takes weeks and sometimes just days. Our recent launch of cars on Hotels.com in the U.S. is a perfect example of something that never made the cut list because of the massive engineering lift. But post unifying the front-end stacks, it took literally weeks to deploy. That same unified front end allows us to massively increase the breadth and impact of our test-and-learns while our single test environment, along with ML and AI woven throughout the customer experience, now allow us to run many multiples of the tests we used to and call them much faster. The combination of which will allow us to effectively 8x our test-and-learn impact in 2024. It cannot be stated strongly enough. We are just at a completely different place technologically, and the effects we have seen so far are only just scratching the surface of what is possible. And while there are endless achievements to be proud of in our transformation, it is equally remarkable that even while swapping out our engine mid-flight, we were able to deliver consistently solid financial performance. We grew our business throughout our transformation, notably reaching record levels of lodging gross bookings and revenue despite having sold off and shuttered a number of businesses along the way. Our continued operating discipline has driven EBITDA margins to the highest levels in over a decade. We have used our strong free cash flow to aggressively buy back our stock at attractive prices. And as a result, our share count today is down to 2015 levels. We have closed over 100 office locations and we have 30% fewer heads than our 2019 peak. And meaningfully, we have gone from approximately 30% of people working in product and tech in 2019 to 50% today. Again, we are at a truly different place as a company as we launch into '24, which does not mean that it's all just linear improvement from here. That learn in test-and-learn is a big part of our journey, and we will still get things wrong in our tireless effort to improve the customer experience. But we can afford to get a lot more wrong as we, in fact, get a lot more right. Ultimately, more at bats, the sheer power of going fast and simplifying our ability to innovate is what puts us in a position to once again lead our industry technologically for the next decade. So what does all that mean for 2024? On a macro level, we expect travel demand to remain relatively healthy. But we expect growth rates across the world to decelerate, especially early in the year as we lap the post-Omicron tailwinds we saw last year. We are still expecting much faster growth internationally outside North America and Western Europe that we expect the gap to continue closing. We may also see some softness in prices across categories. This past quarter, both hotel and vacation rental ADRs grew very slightly, but the mix effects led to overall lodging ADRs declining year-over-year. And as I mentioned earlier, air ticket prices have declined, particularly in the U.S. and we are seeing some continued pressure on car rental rates. Against this backdrop though, we are well positioned to go back on offense, gain share against competition, and ultimately grow our top and bottom line meaningfully this year. Our strategy will remain largely unchanged, but we can finally stop doing surgery on ourselves and instead execute without the numerous distractions we have faced in recent years. We will be laser focused on 5 strategic priorities, which broadly translate to all parts of our business. First, we will continue our focus on acquiring and retaining high-ROI travelers. We've become much sharper about measuring customer lifetime value and targeting who to go after and which channels, with a greatly improved product driven by the latest ML and AI capabilities and One Key, which now has over 100 million members. We will continue to drive greater retention, repeat and direct business, all of which underpins our shift towards more loyalty in app members. In fact, we ended the year with our highest ever percentage of business coming from the app, up nearly 600 basis points year-over-year. We will be scaling One Key internationally this year and expect to see our mix of app members continue to increase in those markets. With better customer targeting, constantly improving with stickier AI-driven products, and One Key, we feel really good about continuing to build momentum and value in our member roles.Our second priority will be to increase our share of wallet with our travelers and partners. Again, with a product that uses AI and ML to predict the consumer's best next action in order to sell complementary items, be it in the booking flow, post booking and in CRM communications. Our core experience will continue to drive more items and more dollars into the consumer's basket. We will also drive more cross-brand and cross-product engagement through One Key, which enables cross-earn and redemption across all our key brands and encourages consumers to stay in our ecosystem for all their travel needs. We are already seeing early signs of this with an increasing number of customers who cross-shop our brands in the U.S. since the launch of One Key. And as we continue to roll out One Key outside the U.S. and now have the ability to roll out new lines of business on different brands, we expect all of these moves to allow us to capture more wallet share from our consumers. Our third priority will be to accelerate our global market expansion. We've talked before about how we retrenched back to the U.S. during the pandemic while we were overhauling our tech platform and marketing model. We pulled back in certain countries where we did not have the right product market fit and have been spending more but losing share. Now after changing virtually everything from how we market to how we retain customers to our entire product experience, we have what it takes to go back on offense. In the back half of '23, we were able to hold or build share in most of our core markets. And now we have the opportunity to be more aggressive. In '24, you will see us spend up in a number of markets to reclaim real share where we believe we have the right to win. Our fourth priority will be to continue cementing our leadership in the B2B segment. Revenue in this segment grew a stellar 33% in 2023 versus 2022. While it benefited from the APAC reopening and we expect those geo tailwinds to moderate somewhat this year, we are still expecting very strong growth given our differentiated capabilities and a huge TAM to still penetrate. As I have explained before, our B2B business benefits from all the work we have done in product and technology to win in B2C, along with all the B2B-specific innovations we have rolled out over the last few years. We are seeing a strong pipeline of new customers globally, and we continue to find ways to gain wallet share in our accounts. And beyond just offering supply, we have achieved good early results in externalizing components of our technology to our partners as well. Overall, I'm very enthusiastic about reinforcing our leadership in powering the travel industry. Our fifth strategic priority will be to drive efficiency and effectiveness across our business. As I mentioned, we have grown our EBITDA margins to their highest levels in a decade, growing over 300 basis points since 2019. But we are capable of much more. All of our transformation work was not only to enhance our consumer experience, but also to allow us to do more with less. We have significant opportunity to run more efficiently across the company, to eliminate redundant systems, to keep optimizing in the cloud, and utilize the latest productivity capabilities from AI. In addition, we will keep leveraging our technology leadership to find opportunities for decreasing costs while increasing customer experience. The work we have done in improving our customer service operations is a great case study. By building better technology and self-service tools, we have both improved our NPS and created massive efficiencies, all while maintaining our best-in-class service. And generative AI will only accelerate this trend. So in closing, I'm incredibly pleased and proud of everything we have accomplished over the last few years, and I'm really excited about our path forward. Thanks to our massive transformation, we are now a very different company than we were 4 years ago. We are set up to out-innovate our competition for the next decade and efficiently deliver the best experiences for our customers and partners. And if we do that, the business and shareholder returns will take care of itself. While you have to kick me around for one more earnings cycle, let me just say that in addition to the gratitude I feel for the team and all that we have done to foster our collective interest, I'm also grateful to our Chairman, our Board and our shareholders for supporting the ambition we had and helping us get to this point. And with that, I will hand it over to Julie."", 'Julie P. Whalen', ""Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. Before I get into our financials, I do want to take a moment to thank Peter and to express my confidence in Ariane as our new CEO from May. I've had the pleasure of knowing Peter since I joined Expedia Group's Board in 2019 and, of course, in a more detailed manner since assuming my role as CFO in 2022. Throughout this journey, Peter has done an amazing job navigating us through the pandemic, driving our massive business transformation, and setting us up for a very successful future. I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to work for Peter. He will be missed, but I am glad he'll continue to support Expedia Group through his ongoing role on our Board as Vice Chairman. At the same time, I look forward to working alongside Ariane as she assumes her new role as CEO this May. Ariane and I have partnered closely together since I first came to Expedia Group. She's an accomplished operator who has been on our leadership team for many years, and it will be great to have someone so familiar with our business and our ecosystem lead us into this next exciting phase for our company. And now let's turn to the financials. Our fourth quarter results once again reflect another quarter of accelerating performance on the top and bottom line, with revenue and EBITDA growing double digits to record levels. This continued strong quarterly performance resulted in full year results at the highest levels we have ever seen across lodging bookings and overall revenue and EBITDA. For full year 2023, we delivered over $104 billion in total gross bookings, growing 10% versus last year, including almost $74 billion in lodging bookings growing 11%, with the hotel business growing even faster at 18%. We drove $12.8 billion of revenue, growing 10%, and we also generated $2.7 billion of EBITDA with an EBITDA margin of 21%, which grew faster than revenue at 14% and resulted in year-over-year margin expansion of almost 75 basis points. In addition, our B2C business saw a meaningful sequential acceleration in year-over-year revenue growth in the back half of the year and generated marketing leverage for the full year. And our B2B business went from strength to strength, having its most successful year in our history with both top and bottom line growth of over 33%. And this overall strong financial performance resulted in us meeting our full year guidance of double-digit top line growth with margin expansion. Now I will discuss more of the details regarding our fourth quarter results. Total gross bookings of $21.7 billion were up 6% versus last year. Gross bookings were impacted by some pressure in our air bookings in the quarter, primarily driven by lower average ticket prices as more capacity came online as well as overall gross bookings pressure at the beginning of the quarter from the crisis in the Middle East as we called out on our last quarter's earnings call. Gross bookings for lodging, our largest business, had another record quarter, growing 8%, relatively in line with our third quarter growth rate. And we saw even faster growth in our hotel business at 13%. We also continued to gain or maintain share in our hotel business across our key markets around the world, consistent with last quarter. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $2.9 billion was the highest on record and grew 10% versus last year. This was an approximate 160 basis point acceleration from the third quarter, driven by both our B2C and B2B segments. Revenue growth is primarily driven by the continued performance of lodging, which grew 14%. Total revenue margin also increased by approximately 55 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by the continued mix to lodging, which has higher margins. Cost of sales was $336 million for the quarter and $72 million or 17% lower than last year which, combined with our strong top line growth, drove approximately 390 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus last year. We were pleased to see that our ongoing initiatives to deliver an improved customer experience and increased automation are resulting in continued operating efficiencies, resulting in lower cost year-over-year despite higher top line growth. Direct sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, which was up 14% versus last year largely due to an increase in commissions in our B2B business to support its ongoing strong revenue growth of 28% year-over-year. As we have stated previously, commissions paid to our B2B partners are in our direct sales and marketing line and are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. However, because they are generally paid on a stayed basis to contractually agreed upon percentages, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. In our B2C business, our marketing spend as a percentage of gross bookings was flat. Overhead expenses were $654 million, an increase of $64 million versus last year or 11%. As we have stated previously, this increase is a result of our investment in talent across our product and technology teams to support our strategic initiatives. With our strong revenue performance and expense discipline, with expenses overall growing slower than revenue, we delivered record EBITDA of $532 million, which was up 19% year-over-year, with an EBITDA margin of 18.5%, expanding over 130 basis points year-over-year. Both EBITDA growth and margin expansion accelerated sequentially from the third quarter. This strong earnings growth enabled us to generate another year of robust free cash flow at $1.8 billion. Free cash flow year-over-year would have been even higher but was impacted by timing changes within working capital. Last year, as the business emerged from the pandemic, we saw meaningful year-over-year increases in our deferred merchant bookings balance, which has since normalized this year. These strong free cash flow levels enabled us to complete our largest ever level of share repurchases at $2 billion or over 19 million shares. Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $6.8 billion driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $4.2 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with plenty of cash to operate the business. Our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion with an average cost at only 3.7%. Our gross leverage ratio, at a further reduced 2.3x, continues to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio of 2x, driven by our ongoing strong EBITDA growth. As we look ahead towards 2024, we anticipate that market growth rates will moderate in '24, given the absence of COVID-driven tailwinds that were prominent last year. But despite this backdrop, given the operational changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years, we expect to have another strong year with top line year-over-year growth relatively in line with what we saw in 2023. On the bottom line, we believe we have further room to optimize our cost structure and therefore, improve margins. We expect to continue to drive operating efficiencies and cost of sales across our customer support and other operations. And with overhead expenses, as we have said, we expect to drive savings this year as we deprecate systems and redeploy resources now that the bulk of our re-platforming is in the rearview mirror. These efficiencies and overhead will also translate over to reduced CapEx levels. Overall, we are taking a very close look at streamlining our cost structure to align with the next phase of our journey. And based on our initial estimates, these actions are expected to result in approximately $80 million to $100 million in onetime GAAP expenses on the year, heavily weighted towards the first quarter. We are still finalizing the details, but we expect to have more to share this quarter. As far as marketing, we are investing behind our global expansion efforts to reignite our international growth and drive further market share gains. This will naturally drive some shorter-term pressure on marketing efficiency for our B2C business. But despite this incremental investment, we expect to still drive overall B2C marketing leverage on the year as a percentage of gross bookings As we continue to improve direct transactions, retention and conversion with more scale. Putting this all together, we expect to deliver another record year of EBITDA with EBITDA margin expansion at levels relatively similar to what we saw in 2023. This EBITDA growth and some possible early repayment of debt should enable us to hit our target leverage ratio of approximately 2x this year. We also expect this EBITDA growth, combined with the benefit we expect to see from the CapEx efficiencies I mentioned earlier, to drive strong free cash flow growth. And we aim to leverage the strong free cash flow to further maximize shareholder returns. While our stock price has increased in recent months, we continue to believe that it remains undervalued and does not reflect our expected long-term performance of the business. As such, we will utilize the strong cash-generating power of our business and our new $5 billion share repurchase authorization announced last quarter to continue buying back our stock opportunistically. As it pertains to our first quarter outlook, last year, our first quarter was very strong. And we, therefore, are facing some tough comps in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, to start the year, we have seen continued pressure in air due to reduced pricing levels from increased capacity and the grounding of the Boeing fleet as well as some pressure in our Vrbo brand, as Peter alluded to earlier. As a result, we expect our gross bookings growth in the first quarter to be in the low to mid-single digits and our revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. In addition, we expect some EBITDA margin compression consistent with the levels we saw in Q1 last year. As we move throughout the year, we expect our growth rates will increase due to conversion gains from product improvements, the continued stacking of high-ROI customers accelerated further by momentum building in our One Key loyalty program, and higher traction in our faster-growing global markets. So in closing, I am really proud of what our team has been able to accomplish through the successful execution of our multiyear initiatives, which enabled us to deliver one of the strongest financial years on record here at Expedia Group. Yet it feels that we're just getting started. With most of the heavy lifting behind us, we are now better positioned than ever to go on the offense. And this, combined with our strong financial position, should enable us to continue to deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder returns. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Naved Khan from B. Riley.', 'Naved Ahmad Khan', ""Yes. Thanks a lot. And Peter, I will miss you on these calls after the Q1 call. But I had a few questions, one on Vrbo. With the migration complete, I think you talked about sort of the app update kind of taking some time. And a little surprised that it's still -- been seeing some weakness in January. Just give us some color on what exactly is the reason for that. And you've talked about some sort of green shoots, so give us some commentary there. And then maybe on the -- on One Key. Can you just talk about maybe -- where maybe the learnings are. Are you satisfied with the retention and the conversion so far? And how much room do you see for improvement from here on? And also in terms of international rollout, I think previously, you talked about first half for that. Is that still on the cards?"", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes. So 3 good questions. Lots of material there. Thanks, Naved. And you can call me anytime if you could miss my voice. The -- first, on Vrbo. I would say if you think about what we were doing at the tail end of last year, we were pushing to 100% migration on the app, everything moved over. And I think as we told you, everybody, these steps come with expected conversion degradation because you can't get everything to par. It takes forever. You have to move everything to start working on the new product. So we did that. I'd say that degradation was broadly in line or slightly better than what we hoped, but it was still there. And when you're doing that, you obviously are not investing as heavily in terms of marketing because you're marketing people into a less converting product. So you kind of tend to back off on that spend because the spend becomes less efficient. As you now get to a place where the product is ramping back up very quickly and we've clawed back much of the conversion, which is, I think the green shoots you're referring to, so we're actually gaining much faster than, at least in my tenure, I've ever seen us gain back in terms of one of these transitions. And the product is basically virtually back to the same levels of conversion. Now we can push back in and spend again. There is a little bit of a lag there because you've been underspending, if you will, for a bit, waiting for the product to get to where it's converting as strongly. Now we are spending back up, so it will take a little time to get the engines fully operational, if you will. But it's more or less a sequence we expected to happen. It's just you're seeing it in our numbers now. As far as One Key goes, I think you said, am I satisfied with what we're seeing. I'd say I'm satisfied. It's still early days. I mean we're seeing a lot of the indicators we want to see. As I alluded to, cross-shopping is good. We're seeing one of the things we hope to achieve was getting HCOM -- Hotels.com customers who had fewer than 10 stamps, people who hadn't gotten to earn anything yet, to be more engaged with the product. And we're seeing their repeat rates improve and their business improve. We're starting to see Vrbo customers earn and now burn their One Key rewards not only on Vrbo but other places. But again, those cycles are a bit long. So it will take longer for the millions of people who have now earned One Key Cash on Vrbo, who didn't used to, to come back and spend it because they may not rent a house for 6 months or a year. But that is -- we're laying in that opportunity with our customer base, and then we're crossing that opportunity across the brands. And we're seeing good signs of cross-shopping and people starting to use more brands, so that's all consistent with what we hoped. But this isn't -- it's not a switch you flip. When you talk about travel timing, many people only travel once or twice a year. So it takes a little time, and we're building that in. So all good so far, but looking forward to it being even much more impactful over time. And then international expansion, we're not detailing which countries we're doing exactly when, for competitive reasons. But One Key will roll out. We will push back into a number of markets that were historically pretty strong for us and have stayed reasonably strong, but we just think we have a lot of opportunity. And then we will have some tests into some markets that we haven't been as invested in historically where we think there's opportunity with the new product, new marketing approaches, et cetera. So a lot of exciting opportunity on the international front. It doesn't -- it's not all dependent on One Key. We think there's opportunity regardless. But in the markets where it's relevant, where we have multiple brands that have high brand awareness, we will be moving -- we will be launching One Key there, and we think it will only enhance that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen.', 'Kevin Campbell Kopelman', ""Yes. First of all, Peter, congrats on your tenure. We'll definitely miss you on working with you on the calls. I did want to ask a question on that. Could you let us in to your thought process a little bit? Or any color on your decision to step away and the timing?"", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes, sure. I mean, I think I tried to capture it in my comments. But when this started, the idea was for me to come in for a period of time and sort of right the ship, put us where we want it to be, and then build the team and make sure we have the people to take it forward for the next generation as it were. And the transformation turned into a bigger -- I bit off more than I thought I was going to, and it was a bigger job than I thought it was. And I had my doubts a year ago, but we've made so much progress. And as I stared at -- and the Board and I stared at, should I go further, et cetera, I love this company, I love the category, I love my team, we've built an amazing group here. But I built it so that they can take it forward. And there's never a right time, but hopefully, this is a good time to transition. We're fortunate to have Ariane. We're fortunate to have all the people around her that we brought in or have been here many years. And I just think the company is ready, and I'll be here until May. I'll be busting my butt till then. I'm not -- I don't know how to do it a different way. But -- and look, we still -- transformations are never done. The work is never done. There isn't like an end date and it's like, good, we did #100 on our list of 100 things to do. But we've just made so much progress that I think the company is in a good place for it, and it felt like the right time for everybody."", 'Kevin Campbell Kopelman', ""Understood. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up on Naved's question on Vrbo. Could you walk us through what that looks like as you pass through Q2? Is it fair to think about that as an easier comp once you anniversary the initial platform upgrade? And what the time frame could be to get that back to flat and then growth?"", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes. I think basically, you can assume we anticipate growing out of this consistently across the year. Fourth quarter will be higher than third quarter, higher than second quarter, higher than first quarter. So we expect to continue growing. I think as I alluded to, conversion is now basically back to where it was before we did all this. But we didn't do it to get to even, we did it to get to materially better. And now Vrbo can benefit. And the reason it's going as quickly as it is, is we have lots of winning tests, if you will, that we used on the broader OTA platform that are also winners for Vrbo. So we're able to take a lot of our winning experiments, move them over to Vrbo and get that humming again and -- but we continue to go further. And as I alluded to, our ability to multiply our test-and-learn capacity in a material way, both in speed and in breadth, is really changing how we do things. So now when we have tests -- many of our tests, we launch across all our brands, across all our platforms, all devices, and we just couldn't do that before. So the speed of improvement, we expect to continue to accelerate. That will enhance all the brands, but Vrbo is the one that has a hole to dig out of. They were the most recent hole to dig out of. And so we expect that to continue to grow. We expect the investment back into the brand to continue to have impact. We expect the cross-shopping effect of having the HCOM and Expedia customers being able to use their One Key Cash on Vrbo to have an effect. So all of that, we expect to continue to build throughout the year. But we shot our own foot off on purpose late last year. We pulled back on spend because we thought that was the rational thing to do given the conversion situation. And now we're leaning back in. And it's really as simple as that, except we expect to improve faster in product. And I still think we have the best-in-class marketing, full stop, in our category. And when we go back on offense, it will take hold and both of those things will work together."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.', 'Eric James Sheridan', ""I'd love to ask more of a big picture one. Now with One Key in the market and elements of the re-platforming behind you, how should we think about some of the things you talked about in the prepared remarks about unified product offerings and being more innovative in the way you go to market and retain customers and drive direct traffic? And how we should be thinking about some of the product road map that you're most excited about and the mixture of both growth that could come from those initiatives versus investments that still need to be made?"", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes. I mean I'd say broadly, working backwards, I don't think -- there are investments of time, calories to be made. But in terms of investments of money and capital, I think we're on the other side of that hill, and we expect to be able to do things more efficiently going forward. But if you talk about One Key and the product it's offering, as I say, like One Key is a great way to create stickiness within our environment. But you might have heard me mention that we have finally migrated all our CRM, virtually 100% of our CRM and the brands, to our new unified messaging platform. That platform allows us to do things much faster, to communicate with customers. So whether we have One Key benefits, whether we have new offerings in One Key, whether they are One Key bonuses, all the things we can use to merchandise and keep people and use One Key to be the glue that keeps members sticky. And remember, members get more than just One Key. They get member discounts in the product. And in many of the products, we're expanding that every day. We now have deeper discounts for silver and gold, and so there's just a lot of things to keep them in. But it's important to be able, obviously, to communicate with them in the most modern ways, and that's what our new single messaging platform allows us to do. And then you add on to that -- and this kind of goes to the broader point, as we've woven -- we've improved the products, we've added new features. But I'd say -- you said, what am I most excited about? It's really machine learning and AI plumbed into essentially the entire product experience because what that gets you is effectively a personalized experience for every customer. And that's from the front-end basic shopping flows, as I mentioned, to post booking to CRM and everything else. And the more we can connect and now that we have a single identity for our customers and now that we can use that data to give them the best experience, we're seeing some of our best wins now. Just as algorithms improve and learn and new versions come out, whether it's to optimize pictures or content or what you see in what order or what filters are applied, like those kinds of things that we can now do at scale, that is what I'm most excited about. I mean we have lots of cool features. We have all kinds of things going on to improve the air shopping experience, the package shopping experience, you name it. But really, at its core, I think having plumbed in the AI and ML, we can now do so much more, so much more quickly. And it will feel to the consumer like a much more customized experience that's relevant to them. And I think that's inherently sticky in a way that, frankly, travel products have not historically been in our space. So that's what I'm most excited about."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank.', 'Lee Horowitz', ""First, Peter, congrats on your tenure. Thanks again for the crazy couple of years, and congratulations on all that you've accomplished over that time period. Maybe just sticking with Vrbo as we think about it in 2024. I guess, one, how do you feel about the overall health of the alternative accommodations industry? Do you think there may be some continued pricing headwinds in, say, core vacation rental destinations as travel patterns continue to normalize and perhaps some macro weakness plays through? And then secondly, can you provide any thoughts on how the competitive set for Vrbo has evolved over the past couple of years? Maybe as you've taken your foot off the gas and how maybe this shift in competitive landscape, if it is happening, is informing your strategies to get this business back to humming again?"", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes. Sure, Lee. And thanks for your thoughts. It has been a couple of crazy years. The -- I would say a few things, sort of working backwards. I think, obviously, we've seen VR continue to be healthy even as -- even post pandemic as habits have shifted. However, there's like VR within VR. So urban has done better. We are not heavily weighted to urban. As you know, some of our competitors are. I think that's what you mean by the evolving landscape. Obviously, Airbnb has always been there. Booking has been doing more with that product, again, largely as best we can tell, focused in benefiting from the urban side of VR or alternative accommodations. We're still squarely situated in our core markets. We haven't made a big decision to pivot to urban. But one of the things that's enabled by all the migrations we're doing that will come this year, we have a bunch of multiunit VR inventory on our OTA brands that is not on Vrbo. And we still have some Vrbo content that is not on our OTA brands. So there's still opportunity to do more in sharing the inventory we already possess. We've had no shortage of finding inventory. And I think housing market issues and other things probably make that macro easier now. It's really just changing habits. Now our hedge against renting a mountain house or a beach house is, of course, renting a hotel or resort room as the alternative. And we've participated very well on that, and we feel good about our position there. But I think we feel very good about Vrbo. We needed to get the product to a new place. We are now firmly on that journey. I don't think we gave space to anybody. I think we have a good brand. We have an improving product that I have no doubt will be best-in-class, and we just have to get back on offense. And again, this is one of those places where you had to take a pause, go slow to go fast. And the slow part always hurts a little. But if you don't do it, you can never go fast. So we're in a good spot now, and I think we just have to accelerate out of it. And I don't worry about the supply situation. And I don't really think we're losing ground to other competitors who have some super sticky product. And over time, we should have the stickiest product because our product comes with loyalty, and our loyalty is usable across any travel product. So I think that's a winning combination. We just got to keep pounding it home now. And now that we have the product to get behind, we will do that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Anthony Post from Bank of America.', 'Justin Post', 'Great. I guess a couple for Julie. You gave us the 11% growth for lodging and 18% for hotels, so we can kind of solve for Vrbo. But can you give us any range of what percent your alternative accommodation nights are or bookings, just so we can -- not have too big of a range there? And then second, last year, you were very clear, double-digit top and bottom line. I think you said similar growth on the top line and then margin improvement. I mean, is that kind of saying double digit for both? Or do you want to clarify kind of the growth rates at all?', 'Julie P. Whalen', ""Sure. On the first one, we haven't -- and I think recently, we haven't given out what percent is our Vrbo piece of the business. But I think when we bought the company, there was some -- and obviously, numbers that were provided at that time. You could do some extrapolation on the growth rate and get pretty close probably. So I don't think there's anything else that we would give out today from a disclosure perspective on that front.On the guidance perspective, we basically have said, as you alluded to, that we are planning to grow relatively in line with our growth rates from this year, which is about, call it, 9.5%, 10% in GBV and 10% on revenue. And then we said with margin expansion relatively in line, which we're calling about 75 basis points for expansion this year. So that's how I would take it. I mean relatively in line to us, plus or minus 100 or so basis points, but that's how I think -- I'd think about it, that it's both for GBV and revenue."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer.', 'Jed Kelly', ""Yes. Just going on to your overall marketing strategy, just by watching TV, I still see you're still marketing to a lot of the brands, Hotels.com, Expedia. And do you start to pivot those brands more into One Key? Can you talk about that? And then can you just talk about your comments on streamlining expenses? Sort of what's the strategy behind that move?"", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes, sure. Thanks, Jed. So on the marketing front, yes, in the U.S., you will see all the brands advertised. It used to be far more brands. We're down to those core 3, and we believe in those 3. I think we're still trying to find the balance between can they be advertised as one? Or do they need to be advertised as 3? And what is the best way to penetrate? So I would think of that as sort of a -- we're on our own learning journey about what we can do and how we can help people see them as a family of products that work together. And we continue to try to optimize, be it on television, which is what you're seeing, or in programmatic or frankly even in metasearch and so forth. So we're constantly working to see what the optimum way to drive those are. But I will say in the rest of the world, we have made very conscious decisions of where we will maintain one brand or if we think it's worth at 2 or 3 brands and what we will do there. And we will lean heavily into -- it's a high bar for there to be more than one. There has to be real brand affinity and other things that are driving that continuation of the second brand. So especially now that conceivably, any of our brands could have all or any lines of business and that's not that hard for us to do. So the opportunity to take, for example, a market that is a predominant Hotels.com market and potentially add car and air and other packages and other things is within our gift now. And so we can make quite different decisions about do we need to be in with Expedia just to have air or something else? So that's really a big opportunity for us and allows us to simplify how we think about those decisions and, in some ways, not replicate some of the complexity we've made for ourselves over the years. So that's a work in progress, but all those things are effective, and we're working to optimize all the time on the best way to communicate that. Maybe Julie can say something about the expenses."", 'Julie P. Whalen', ""Yes. So on the streamlining of expenses, I think we've been saying all last year that, obviously, during the transformation phase, we've ramped up in expenses. We've had duplicate systems, legacy systems, while we're still building out the new system, and all the costs that are associated with that across the board from cloud and licensing and maintenance and things like that. And so we have said, as we come out of this transformation phase, that we think there's opportunity to deprecate systems and redeploy resources and find cost savings throughout the P&L. And so this is our first sort of stab, if you will, at that. And so you'll see things across the board coming out as we move throughout the year in cost of sales, in overhead. And to the extent that obviously crosses over into capital expenditures, you'll see some of the pressure coming off, at least the growth rates there. And if not, like in -- also in absolute dollars. But that's simply what that represents. We're obviously not going to go into a lot of details today, but we did purposely say that we will give you more information sort of later this quarter and as we move throughout the year on that as we give you more of the details associated with it."", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes. And I would just add. That's always been the plot that we wanted. This wasn't just to build cool new things. This was also to build them the right way and be efficient in how we did it. And that's the opportunity that the transformation has also provided for us, and we're excited to be on that side of it too, not just from an experience standpoint but from an efficiency standpoint."", 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI.', 'Mark Stephen F. Mahaney', ""Okay. I'm sure these questions have been covered, but if I could ask again, please. Of these 2 initiatives, the re-platforming of the brands, particularly the Vrbo brand, and then the One Key strategy, is it -- I assume these are more like snowball events. Have you already seen an impact on the business or on demand, cross-selling, retention, acquisition from these so far? Or would you -- if not, could you lay out expectations of when we would?"", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Yes, Mark. I'll give you a quick answer. I think we sort of addressed some of it already. But basically, the Vrbo transition to the unified stack is more of just an execution thing. I think what it gives us is the opportunity now to accelerate Vrbo in terms of feature and test-and-learn and grow faster, as I mentioned, to the rest of the group. We dug a hole, we knew we would. When we moved it to the new stack, the conversion would go down. We have been digging out of that hole. We're about back to par, but we didn't do it to get to par. We did it to accelerate far past that. And now we have the opportunity in Vrbo, riding on the same rail as the other brands, gets the benefit of all the testing, shared testing opportunities that we -- winners that we found in other places and so forth. So we're excited about the progression of that product, but it had to go through the bad to get to the good.As far as One Key goes, I also mentioned, we feel very good about the early indicators. Yes, there is more cross-shopping. Yes, we're seeing more repeat from certain pools of customers that we thought would benefit from this like Hotels.com customers who had less than 10 stamps in our old system and people, if you will, who hadn't earned any benefit. Now they have benefit and they're coming back more, and that's what we want to see. But as I also mentioned, while millions of people have earned One Key Cash on Vrbo, a small percentage of them have re-spent it. And that just has to do with the cycles of the booking windows for Vrbo and that people rarely book more than once or twice a year, so we've got to get those -- we expect to see those people back in. That's why I've said we've built up this value, and now that value needs to be realized as they come back direct later as they use that One Key Cash across other brands with more cross-shopping. Like that's the dream. And of course, getting Expedia and Hotels.com members to use their One Key Cash on Vrbo, which we've also seen. But again, those cycles aren't every month. People do that once or twice a year. So we're seeing good early signals, but it's all building and that's why I'm excited. Like it's going to be a slow build, but it's going to be a great, sticky thing for us over time. And again, we'll keep more and more -- as we get more of the right people in, as we keep more of them and as they get to use all of our products and again we capture more wallet share from them, that's what we're pushing for. Thank you, everybody. I think that was the last question, operator. Is that right?"", 'Operator', ""That's correct."", 'Peter Maxwell Kern', ""Okay. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate your questions, and we'll see you in May. Take care."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a nice day.""]"

First of all, I just want to acknowledge the news that I will be stepping down in May as CEO after my contract ends and will be passing the baton to Ariane Gorin, who currently heads our Expedia for business. As many of you know, when I started this unexpected journey during COVID, travel was at a standstill. Money was flowing out of the company faster than we could replace it. And our people, our shareholders, and most of the world were unsure how and when we would ever come back.', ""Strangely, those days never really worried me. Maybe I'm an optimist, but I always believed we'd get back to life and travel would follow. While you might assume that COVID was the defining part of my tenure, in reality, we quickly saw an opportunity to use our COVID time to embark on one of the most audacious and ambitious transformations I think a company of our size has ever attempted. It was always my hope that we would finish this massive task by now, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that was sometimes in doubt. We had many fits and starts as we took on this massive overhaul. But when you do something as bold as we were attempting, you have to be prepared to deal with some mess."", ""And as much as anything, I'm proud that we were not afraid of the mess and we pushed through. And as the work began to accelerate in the back half of last year, I could finally see that what would, in fact, meet my -- that we would, in fact, meet my timetable. Over the last four years, we built a tremendous team who, in turn, accomplished amazing things. I have to say that what started in an unlikely and difficult way turned out to be one of the most compelling and challenging opportunities of my career. Now, I'm not going anywhere yet, and I intend to sprint through the finish line on the way out. Among my important tasks between now and then is ensuring an absolutely seamless transition to Ariane and making sure none of our team misses a beat."", ""I just want to say that I've had the pleasure of working with Ariane closely for the last four years, and I believe she is a terrific choice to take the company forward and build on what we have created. She is a seasoned leader with a very successful track record with Expedia Group, including most recently, as head of our market-leading B2B business. I look forward to working with Ariane over the next few months, and I will not be going far as I return to my perch as vice chairman. Now that I've addressed that, let's move on to our results. I was generally very pleased with our performance in '23. We met our guidance despite what was a year of tremendous change."", ""It is really difficult to fully appreciate the breadth of change and the volatility that such change can create. We've discussed this many times, but when you have to willingly take steps backward to go forward, you create a lot of inherent unpredictability. And yet despite that, we delivered and landed the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong revenue and EBITDA performance, but we did see some softness in gross bookings driven primarily by air, which in turn was largely driven by a reduction in average ticket prices. As you all know, air does not impact revenue or profitability very much, but it does have an outsized impact on our overall gross bookings. While air has been showing some signs of macro softening, we continue to improve our air product with new AI-driven features and pricing capabilities, and like many areas of our business, we see significant opportunity to grow regardless of any macro headwinds."", ""Our lodging business held up very well and had yet another record quarter with our hotel gross bookings growing 13% year over year. Vrbo finished its planned front-end migration in Q4 and suffered expected conversion degradation. But it now has more tests running than ever in its history, and we are clawing back conversion at a breakneck pace. We also cut back last year on Vrbo marketing in concert with the expected conversion degradation but are now really excited about our new brand work that is designed to punch our main competitor squarely in the nose, and we are leaning back into spend. There's a bit of a lag effect as we ramp back up, but we are excited to get Vrbo back on offense with the product improving every day, the impact from improved and increased marketing, and of course, our secret weapon in One Key whose effect will only continue to build. We did an awful lot in '23, from the launch of One Key to the completion of the Vrbo migration, from the plumbing of machine learning and AI into more and more of our customer experience, to the launch of ChatGPT-assisted trip planning. But more important than any win in '23 is the sheer magnitude of change we have driven since we embarked on our transformation journey at the beginning of 2020."", 'Over this period, we rationalized investments in over 20 brands to three or fewer in every region. We eliminated dependency on 76 different agencies around the globe and, instead, built an entire full-service marketing, creative, and media-buying team internally. We consolidated all performance marketing into one group with unified data and tools, allowing us to optimize across brands and bring programmatic approaches to everything we do in metasearch, social, SEO, and everywhere else. And we fundamentally shifted the business from transactional web arbitrage to app-first, focused on acquiring and retaining the customers with the highest LTV and return on investment. On the tech side, we decommissioned 17 CRM systems and built one universal messaging platform linking all brands. We went from seven different loyalty stacks to One Key.', 'We consolidated from 13 machine learning platforms and four experimentation platforms to one. We converged 300 million customer data profiles into one common identity platform. We have meaningfully reduced the number of developer tools and optimized our IT footprint. And most importantly, all -- all our brands are now on a single front-end stack with a unified test platform that gives us the ability to rapidly launch tests and features across brands, platforms, and geos. It is hard to fully conceptualize how much we have changed, but perhaps one simple way is to double-click on how all these elements allow us to massively accelerate our test and learn capability and drive faster feature deployment and better performance in the product. Our unified front end now allows us to deploy features around the globe and on any brand at a pace we could not contemplate just a couple of years ago.', 'What used to take months, even years, now takes weeks and sometimes just days. Our recent launch of cars on Hotels.com in the US is a perfect example of something that never made the cut list because of the massive engineering lift. But post unifying the front-end stacks, it took literally weeks to deploy. That same unified front end allows us to massively increase the breadth and impact of our test and learns, while our single test environment, along with ML and AI woven throughout the customer experience, now allow us to run many multiples of the tests we used to and call them much faster. The combination of which will allow us to effectively aid our test and learn impact in 2024. It cannot be stated strongly enough, we are just at a completely different place technologically, and the effects we have seen so far are only just scratching the surface of what is possible.', 'And while there are endless achievements to be proud of in our transformation, it is equally remarkable that even while swapping out our engine mid-flight, we were able to deliver consistently solid financial performance. We grew our business throughout our transformation, notably reaching record levels of lodging gross bookings and revenue despite having sold off and shuttered a number of businesses along the way. Our continued operating discipline has driven EBITDA margins to the highest levels in over a decade. We have used our strong free cash flow to aggressively buy back our stock at attractive prices, and as a result, our share count today is down to 2015 levels. We have closed over 100 office locations, and we have 30% fewer heads than our 2019 peak. And meaningfully, we have gone from approximately 30% of people working in product and tech in 2019 to 50% today.', ""Again, we are at a truly different place as a company, as we launch into '24, which does not mean that it's all just linear improvement from here. That learn and test and learn is a big part of our journey, and we will still get things wrong in our tireless effort to improve the customer experience. But we can afford to get a lot more wrong as we, in fact, get a lot more right. Ultimately, more at bats, the sheer power of going fast, and simplifying our ability to innovate is what puts us in a position to once again lead our industry technologically for the next decade. So, what does all that mean for 2024? On a macro level, we expect travel demand to remain relatively healthy, but we expect growth rates across the world to decelerate, especially early in the year as we lap the post-omicron tailwinds we saw last year. We are still expecting much faster growth internationally outside North America and Western Europe that we expect the gap to continue closing. We may -- we may also see some softness in prices across categories."", 'This past quarter, both hotel and vacation rental orders grew very slightly, but the mix effects led to overall lodging ADRs declining year over year. And as I mentioned earlier, air ticket prices have declined particularly in the US, and we are seeing some continued pressure on car rental rates. Against this backdrop, though, we are well positioned to go back on offense, gain share against competition, and ultimately grow our top and bottom line meaningfully this year. Our strategy will remain largely unchanged, but we can finally stop doing surgery on ourselves and instead execute without the numerous distractions we have faced in recent years. We will be laser-focused on five strategic priorities, which broadly translate to all parts of our business. First, we will continue our focus on acquiring and retaining high-ROI travelers.', ""We have become much sharper about measuring customer lifetime value and targeting who to go after and which channels. With a greatly improved product driven by the latest ML and AI capabilities and One Key, which now has over 100 million members, we will continue to drive greater retention, repeat, and direct business, all of which underpins our shift toward more loyalty and app members. In fact, we ended the year with our highest-ever percentage of business coming from the app, up nearly 600 basis points year over year. We will be scaling One Key internationally this year and expect to see our mix of app members continue to increase in those markets. With better customer targeting, constantly improving and stickier AI-driven products, and One Key, we feel really good about continuing to build momentum and value in our member roles. Our second priority will be to increase our share of wallet with our travelers and partners, again with a product that uses AI and ML to predict a consumer's best next action in order to sell complementary items. Be it in the booking flow, post-booking, and in CRM communications, our core experience will continue to drive more items and more dollars into the consumer's basket. We will also drive more cross-brand and cross-product engagement through One Key, which enables cross-earn and redemption across all our key brands and encourages consumers to stay in our ecosystem for all their travel needs."", ""We are already seeing early signs of this with an increasing number of customers who cross-shop our brands in the US since the launch of One Key. And as we continue to roll out One Key outside the US and now have the ability to roll out new lines of business on different brands, we expect all of these moves to allow us to capture more wallet share from our consumers. Our third priority will be to accelerate our global market expansion. We've talked before about how we retrans back to the US during the pandemic while we are overhauling our tech platform and marketing model."", ""We pulled back in certain countries where we did not have the right product-market fit and had been spending more but losing share. Now, after changing virtually everything from how we market to how we retain customers to our entire product experience, we have what it takes to go back on offense. And in the back half of '23, we were able to hold or build share in most of our core markets, and now, we have the opportunity to be more aggressive. In '24, you will see us spend up in a number of markets to reclaim real share where we believe we have the right to win. Our fourth priority will be to continue cementing our leadership in the B2B segment. Revenue in this segment grew a stellar 33% in 2023 versus 2022, while it benefited from the APAC reopening, and we expect those geo tailwinds to moderate somewhat this year."", ""We are still expecting very strong growth given our differentiated capabilities and a huge TAM to still penetrate. As I -- as I have explained before, our B2B business benefits from all the work we have done in product and technology to win in B2C, along with all the B2B-specific innovations we have rolled out over the last few years. We are seeing a strong pipeline of new customers globally, and we continue to find ways to gain wallet share in our -- in our accounts. And beyond just offering supply, we have achieved good early results in externalizing components of our technology to our partners as well. Overall, I'm very enthusiastic about reinforcing our leadership in powering the travel industry."", 'Our fifth strategic -- strategic priority will be to drive efficiency and effectiveness across our business. As I mentioned, we have grown our EBITDA margins to their highest levels in a decade, growing over 300 basis points since 2019. But we are capable of much more. All of our transformation work was not only to enhance our consumer experience but also to allow us to do more with less. We have significant opportunity to run more efficiently across the company to eliminate redundant systems, to keep optimizing in the cloud, and utilize the latest productivity capabilities from AI.', ""In addition, we will keep leveraging our technology leadership to find opportunities for decreasing costs while increasing customer experience. The work we have done in improving our customer service operations is a great case study. By building better technology and self-service tools, we have both improved our NPS and creative massive efficiencies, all while maintaining our best-in-class service, and generative AI will only accelerate this trend. So, in closing, I'm incredibly pleased and proud of everything we have accomplished over the last few years, and I'm really excited about our path forward. Thanks to our massive transformation, we are now a very different company than we were four years ago. We are set up to out-innovate our competition for the next decade and efficiently deliver the best experiences for our customers and partners. And if we do that, the business and shareholder returns will take care of themselves."", ""Well, you have to kick me around for one more earnings cycle. Let me just say that, in addition to the gratitude I feel for the team and all that we have done to foster our collective interests, I'm also grateful to our chairman, our board, and our shareholders for supporting the ambition we had and helping us get to this point. And with that, I will hand it over to Julie."", 'Julie Whalen -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. Before I get into our financials, I do want to take a moment to thank Peter and to express my confidence in Ariane as our new CEO come May. I've had the pleasure of knowing Peter since I joined Expedia Group's board in 2019 and, of course, in a more detailed manner since assuming my role as CFO in 2022. Throughout this journey, Peter has done an amazing job navigating us through the pandemic, driving our massive business transformation, and setting us up for a very successful future. I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to work for Peter."", ""He will be missed, but I am glad he'll continue to support Expedia Group through his ongoing role on our board as vice chairman. At the same time, I look forward to working alongside Ariane as she assumes her new role as CEO this May. Ariane and I have partnered closely together since I first came to Expedia Group. She's an accomplished operator who has been in our leadership team for many years, and it will be great to have someone so familiar with our business and our ecosystem lead us into this next exciting phase for our company. And now, let's turn to the financials."", 'Our fourth-quarter results once again reflect another quarter of accelerating performance on the top and bottom line with revenue and EBITDA growing double digits to record levels. This continued strong quarterly performance resulted in full-year results at the highest levels we have ever seen across lodging bookings and overall revenue and EBITDA. For full-year 2023, we delivered over 104 billion in total gross bookings, growing 10% versus last year, including almost 74 billion in lodging bookings growing 11%, with the hotel business growing even faster at 18%. We drove 12.8 billion of revenue, growing 10%, and we also generated 2.7 billion of EBITDA with an EBITDA margin of 21% which grew faster than revenue at 14% and resulted in year-over-year margin expansion of almost 75 basis points. In addition, our B2C business saw meaningful sequential acceleration in year-over-year revenue growth in the back half of the year and generated marketing leverage for the full year. And our B2B business went from strength to strength, having its most successful year in our history with both top and bottom-line growth of over 33%.', ""And this overall strong financial performance resulted in us meeting our full-year guidance of double-digit top-line growth with margin expansion. Now, I will discuss more of the details regarding our fourth-quarter results. Total gross bookings of 21.7 billion were up 6% versus last year. Gross bookings were impacted by some pressure in our air bookings in the quarter, primarily driven by lower average ticket prices as more capacity came online, as well as overall gross bookings pressure at the beginning of the quarter from the crisis in the Middle East, as we called out on our last quarter's earnings call. Gross bookings for lodging, our largest business, had another record quarter, growing 8%, relatively in line with our third-quarter growth rate, and we saw even faster growth in our hotel business at 13%. We also continued to gain or maintain share in our hotel business across our key markets around the world, consistent with last quarter. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&L, starting with total revenue."", 'Revenue of 2.9 billion was the highest on record and grew 10% versus last year. This was an approximate 160-basis-point acceleration from the third quarter driven by both our B2C and B2B segments. Revenue growth is primarily driven by the continued performance of lodging, which grew 14%. Total revenue margin also increased by approximately 55 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by the continued mix to lodging, which has higher margins. Cost of sales was 336 million for the quarter and 72 million, or 17% lower than last year, which, combined with our strong top-line growth, drove approximately 390 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus last year.', 'We were pleased to see that our ongoing initiatives to deliver an improved customer experience and increased automation are resulting in continued operating efficiencies, resulting in lower costs year over year despite higher top-line growth. Direct sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter was 1.4 billion, which was up 14% versus last year, largely due to an increase in commissions in our B2B business to support its ongoing strong revenue growth of 28% year over year. As we have stated previously, commissions paid to our B2B partners are in our direct sales and marketing line and are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. However, because they are generally paid on a stayed basis to contractually agreed-upon percentages, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. In our B2C business, our marketing spend as a percentage of gross bookings was flat. Overhead expenses were 654 million, an increase of 64 million versus last year, or 11%.', 'As we have stated previously, this increase is a result of our investment in talent across our product and technology teams to support our strategic initiatives. With our strong revenue performance and expense discipline, with expenses overall growing slower than revenue, we delivered record EBITDA of 532 million which was up 19% year over year, with an EBITDA margin of 18.5% expanding over 130 basis points year over year. Both EBITDA growth and margin expansion accelerated sequentially from the third quarter. The strong earnings growth enabled us to generate another year of robust free cash flow at 1.8 billion. Free cash flow year over year would have been even higher but was impacted by timing changes within working capital. Last year, as the business emerged from the pandemic, we saw meaningful year-over-year increases in our deferred merchant bookings balance, which has since normalized this year. These strong free cash flow levels enabled us to complete our largest-ever level of share repurchases at 2 billion, or over 19 million shares.', ""Moving on to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of 6.8 billion driven by our unrestricted cash balance of 4.2 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of 2.5 billion, which provides us with plenty of cash to operate the business. Our debt level remains at approximately 6.3 billion with an average cost at only 3.7%. Our gross leverage ratio at a further reduced 2.3 times continues to make progress toward our target gross leverage ratio of two times driven by our ongoing strong EBITDA growth. As we look ahead toward 2024, we anticipate that market growth rates will moderate in '24 given the absence of COVID-driven tailwinds that were prominent last year. But despite this backdrop, given the operational changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years, we expect to have another strong year with top-line year-over-year growth relatively in line with what we saw in 2023. On the bottom line, we believe we have further room to optimize our cost structure and, therefore, improve margins. We expect to continue to drive operating efficiencies and cost of sales across our customer support and other operations."", 'And with overhead expenses, as we have said, we expect to drive savings this year as we deprecate systems and redeploy resources now that the bulk of our replatforming is in the rearview mirror. These efficiencies and overhead will also translate over to reduced capex levels. Overall, we are taking a very close look at streamlining our cost structure to align with the next phase of our journey. And based on our initial estimates, these actions are expected to result in approximately 80 million to 100 million in one-time GAAP expenses on the year, heavily weighted toward the first quarter. We are still finalizing the details, but we expect to have more to share this quarter.', 'As far as marketing, we are investing behind our global expansion efforts to reignite our international growth and drive further market share gains. This will naturally drive some shorter-term pressure on marketing efficiency for our B2C business. But despite this incremental investment, we expect to still drive overall B2C marketing leverage on the year as a percentage of gross bookings as we continue to improve direct transactions, retention and conversion with more scale. Putting this all together, we expect to deliver another record year of EBITDA with EBITDA margin expansion at levels relatively similar to what we saw in 2023. This EBITDA growth and some possible early repayment of debt should enable us to hit our target leverage ratio of approximately two times this year. We also expect this EBITDA growth, combined with the benefit we expect to see from the capex efficiencies I mentioned earlier, to drive strong free cash flow growth.', 'And we aim to leverage the strong free cash flow to further maximize shareholder returns. While our stock prices increased in recent months, we continue to believe that it remains undervalued and does not reflect our expected long-term performance of the business. As such, we will utilize the strong cash-generating power of our business and our new $5 billion share repurchase authorization announced last quarter to continue buying back our stock opportunistically. As it pertains to our first-quarter outlook, last year, our first quarter was very strong and we therefore are facing some tough comps in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, to start the year, we have seen continued pressure in air due to reduced pricing levels from increased capacity and the grounding of the Boeing fleet, as well as some pressure in our Vrbo brand as Peter alluded to earlier. As a result, we expect our gross bookings growth in the first quarter to be in the low to mid-single digits and our revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits.', ""In addition, we expect some EBITDA margin compression consistent with the levels we saw in Q1 last year. As we move throughout the year, we expect our growth rates will increase due to conversion gains from product improvements. The continued stacking of high-ROI customers accelerated further by momentum building in our One Key loyalty program and higher traction in our faster-growing global markets. So, in closing, I am really proud of what our team has been able to accomplish through the successful execution of our multi-year initiatives, which enabled us to deliver one of the strongest financial years on record here at Expedia Group, yet it feels like we're just getting started."", 'With most of the heavy lifting behind us, we are now better positioned than ever to go on the offense. And this, combined with our strong financial position, should enable us to continue to deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder returns. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead.', 'Naved Khan -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst', ""Yeah, thanks -- thanks a lot, and Peter, we'll miss you on these calls after the Q1 call. But I have a few questions. One on Vrbo. You know, with the migration complete, I think you talked about sort of, you know, the app update kind of taking some time."", ""And a little surprised that it's still been seeing some weakness in January. Just give us some color on what exactly is the reason for that. And -- and you talked about some -- some sort of green shoots, so give us some -- some commentary there. And then, maybe on the -- on One Key, can you talk about maybe where -- maybe the -- the learnings are."", 'Are you satisfied with the retention and the conversion so far? And -- and how much room do you see for improvement from here on? And also, in terms of international rollout, I think, previously, you talked about first half for that. Is that still on the cards?', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, so three -- three good questions, lots of material there. Thanks, Naved, and you can call me anytime if you miss my voice. The -- first, on Vrbo, I would say, you know, if you think about what we were doing at the tail end of last year, we were pushing to 100% migration, the app, everything, moved over. And I think as we told everybody, you know, these steps come with expected conversion degradation because you can't get everything to par. You know, it takes forever, you have to move everything and start working on a new product."", ""So, we did that. I'd say that degradation was broadly in line or slightly better than what we hoped, but it was still there. And when you're doing that, you obviously are not investing as heavily in terms of marketing because you're -- you're marketing people into a less-converting product. So, you kind of tend to back off on that spend because the spend becomes less efficient. As you now get to a place where the product is ramping back up very quickly, and we've clawed back much of the conversion, which is, I think, the green shoots you're referring to, so we're -- we're actually gaining much faster than -- at least in my tenure, I've ever seen us gain back in terms of one of these transitions."", ""And the product is -- is basically virtually back to the same levels of conversion, now we can push back in and spend again. There is a little bit of a lag there because you've been underspending, if you will, for a bit, waiting for the product to get to where it's converting as strongly. Now, we are spending back up, so you know, it will take a little time to get the engines fully operational, if you will. But it's more or less a sequence we expected to happen. It's just you're seeing it on a numbers now."", ""As far as One Key goes, you know, I think you said am I satisfied with what we're seeing. I'd say I'm satisfied. It's still early days. I mean, we're seeing a lot of the indicators we want to see. As I alluded to, cross-shopping is good."", ""We're seeing -- you know, one of the things we hope to achieve was Hcom customers -- Hotels.com customers who had fewer than 10 stamps, you know, people who hadn't gotten to earn anything yet, to be more engaged with the product. And we're seeing their repeat rates improve and their business improve. We're -- you know, we're starting to see Vrbo customers earn and now burn their One Key rewards, not only on Vrbo but other places. But again, those cycles are a bit long."", ""So, it will take longer for, you know, the millions of people who have now earned One Key cash on Vrbo who didn't used to, to come back and spend it because they may not rent the house for six months or a year. But that is, you know, where we're laying in that opportunity with our customer base, and then, we're crossing that opportunity across the brands. And we're -- and we're seeing good signs across shopping and people starting to use more brands. So, that's all consistent with what we hoped."", ""But this isn't a -- you know, it's not a switch and flip. When you talk about travel, timing, you know, many people only travel once or twice a year, so it takes a little time, and we're building that in. So, all good so far but looking forward to it being even, you know, much more impactful over time. And then, international expansion, we're not detailing which countries we're doing exactly when for competitive reasons, but One Key will roll out. We will push back into a number of markets that were historically pretty strong for us and have stayed reasonably strong."", ""But we just think we have a lot of opportunity, and then we will have some tests into some markets that we haven't been as invested in historically, where we think there's opportunity with the new product, new marketing approaches, etc. So, a lot of exciting opportunity on the international front. it doesn't -- it's not all dependent on One Key. We think there's opportunity regardless. But in the markets where it's relevant, where we have multiple brands that have -- that have high brand awareness, we will be moving."", 'You know, we will be launching One Key there, and we think it will only enhance that.', 'Naved Khan -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you, Peter.', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Kevin, please go ahead.', 'Kevin Kopelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, first of all, Peter, congrats on -- on your tenure. We'll definitely miss you on -- working with you on the calls. I did want to ask a question on that."", 'Could you let us into your -- your thought process a little bit or any color on -- on your decision to step away and the -- and the timing?', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, sure. I mean, I think I tried to capture it in my comments. But, you know, when -- when this started, the idea was for me to come in for a period of time and sort of right the ship, put us where we want it to be, and -- and then, you know, build the team, and make sure we had the people to take it forward for, you know, the next generation as it were. And, you know, the transformation turned into a bigger -- you know, I bit off more than I thought I was going to and it was a bigger job than I thought it was.', ""And -- and, you know, I had my doubts, you know, a year ago, but -- but, you know, we've made so much progress and as I stated, you know, and -- and the board and I stated, you know, should -- should -- should I go further, etc. You know, I love this company. I love the category. I love my team. We've built an amazing group here, but I built it so that they could take it forward."", ""And, you know, there's never a right time, but hopefully, this is a good time to transition. We're fortunate to have Ariane. We're fortunate to have, you know, all the people around her that we've brought in or have been here many years. And I just think the company is ready. And, you know, I'll be here till May."", ""I'll be, you know, busting my butt till then. You know, I'm not -- I don't know how to do it a different way. But and -- and, look, we still -- transformations are never done. The work is never done."", ""You know, there isn't like an end date and it's like, good, we did, you know, number 100 on our list of 100 things to do, but we've just made so much progress that I think the company is in a good place for it and -- and it felt like the right time for everybody."", 'Kevin Kopelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Understood. Thanks for that. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up on Naved's question about Vrbo."", 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure.', 'Kevin Kopelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Could you -- could you walk us through what that looks like as you -- as you pass through Q2? Is it fair to think about that as -- as an easier comp once you anniversary the initial platform upgrade, and -- and what the time frame could be to get that back to -- to flat and then growth?', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I think -- I think, basically, you can assume we -- you know, we anticipate growing out of this consistently across the year. You know, fourth quarter will be higher than third quarter, higher than second quarter, higher than first quarter. So, you know, we expect to continue growing. I think, as I alluded to, you know, conversion is now basically back to, you know, where it was before we -- before we did all this. But we -- but we didn't do it to get to even; we did it to get to materially better, and now Vrbo can benefit."", ""And the reason it's going as quickly as it is, is we have lots of winning tests, if you will, that we used on our -- on the broader OTA platform that are also winners for Vrbo. So, we're able to take a lot of our winning experiments, move them over to Vrbo, and you know, get that humming again. And -- but we -- we continue to go further. And as I alluded to, you know, our ability to multiply our test and learn capacity in a material way both in speed and in breadth is really changing how we do things. So, now when we have tests, many of our tests we launch across all our brands, across all our platforms, all devices, and we just couldn't do that before. So, the speed of improvement, we expect to continue to accelerate."", 'That will enhance all the brands, but Vrbo is the one that has a hole to dig out of, that has the most recent hole to dig out of. And so, we expect that to continue to grow. We expect the investment back into the brand to, you know, continue to have impact. We expect the cross-shopping effect of having the Hcom and -- and Expedia customers being able to use their One Key cash on Vrbo to have an effect. So, all of that, you know, we expect to continue to build throughout the year, but you know, we -- we shot our own foot off on purpose late last year.', ""We pulled back on spend because we thought that was the rational thing to do given the conversion situation. And now, we're leaning back in, and it's really as simple as that except we expect to improve faster in product. And, you know, I still think we have the best-in-class marketing, full stop, in our category. And when we go back on offense, it will take hold, and both of those things will work together."", 'Kevin Kopelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, Peter.', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'You bet.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric, please go ahead.', 'Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Thanks so much for taking the question. I'd love to ask more of a big-picture one. Now with -- with One Key in the market and elements of the replatforming behind you, how do we think about some of the things you talked about in the prepared remarks about unified product offerings and being more innovative in the way you go to market and retain customers and drive direct traffic? And how we should be thinking about some of the product roadmap that you're most excited about and the mixture of both growth that could come from those initiatives versus investments that still need to be made? Thanks."", 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I mean, I'd say, broadly, working backwards, I don't think they're -- you know, they're investments of time, calories to be made. But in terms of investments of money and capital, I think, you know, we're on the other side of that hill, and we expect to be able to do things more efficiently going forward. But if you talk about One Key and the product itself, you know, as I say, like, One Key is a great way to create stickiness within our environment. But you might have heard me mention that we've -- we've finally migrated all our CRM, virtually 100% of our CRM and the brands, to our new unified messaging platform. That platform allows us to do things much faster to communicate with customers."", ""So, whether we have One Key benefits; whether we have new -- you know, new offerings in One Key; whether there are One Key bonuses, you know, all the things we can use to merchandise and keep people and use One Key to be the glue that keeps members sticky. Remember, members get more than just One Key. They get member discounts in the product. And in many of the products, we're expanding that every day. We now have deeper discounts for silver and gold."", ""And so, there's just a lot of things to keep them in. But it's important to be able, obviously, to communicate with them in the most modern ways, and that's what our new single messaging platform allows us to do. And then, you add on to that and this kind of goes to the broader point, as we've woven -- you know, we've improved the products, we've added new features. But I say, you said one of my most excited about, it's really machine learning and AI plumbed into essentially the entire product experience because what that gets you is effectively a personalized experience for every customer. And that's from the front end, you know, basic shopping flows, as I mentioned, to, you know, post -- post-booking to CRM and everything else."", ""And the more we can connect, and now, that we have a single identity for our customers, and now that we can use that data to give them the best experience, we're seeing some of our best wins now just as algorithms improve and learn and new versions come out, whether it's to optimize pictures or content or what you see and what order or what filters are applied. Like, those kinds of things that we can now do at scale, that is what I'm most excited about. I mean, we have lots of cool features. We have all kinds of things going on to improve the air shopping experience, the package shopping experience, you know, you name it."", ""But -- but really at its core, I think having plumbed in the AI and ML, we can now do so much more so much more quickly, and it will feel to the consumer like a much more customized experience that's relevant to them. And I think that's inherently sticky in a way that, you know, frankly, travel products have not historically been in our space. So, that's what I'm most excited about."", 'Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'OK, thank you, Peter.', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Lee, please go ahead.', 'Lee Horowitz -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for the question. First, Peter, congrats on your tenure. Thanks again.', ""It's been a crazy couple of years, and congratulations on all that you've accomplished over that time period. Maybe just sticking with Vrbo as we think about it in 2024, I guess, one, how do you feel about the overall health of the alternative accommodations industry? Do you think there may be some continued pricing headwinds and, say, for vacation rental destinations as travel patterns continue to normalize and perhaps some macro weakness plays through? And then, secondly, can you provide any thoughts on how the competitive set for Vrbo has evolved over the past couple of years, maybe as you've taken your foot off the gas and how maybe this shifting competitive landscape? If it is happening, is it informing your strategies to get this business back to humming again? Thanks."", 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, surely. Thanks -- thanks for your thoughts. It has been a couple of crazy years. The -- I would say a few things.', ""Sort of working backwards, I think, you know, obviously, we've seen VR continue to be healthy even as -- even post-pandemic as habits have shifted. However, there's like VR within VR, so urban has done better. We are not heavily weighted to urban, as you know. Some of our competitors are."", ""I think that's what you mean by the evolving landscape. You know, obviously, Airbnb has always been there. Booking has been doing more with that product. Again, largely, that's we can tell, focused and benefiting from the urban side of VR, or alternative accommodations."", ""You know, we're still squarely situated in -- in our core markets. You know, we haven't made a big decision to pivot to -- to urban, but one of the things that's enabled by all the migrations we're doing that will come this year. We have a bunch of multi-unit VR inventory on our OTA brands that is not on Vrbo, and we still have some Vrbo content that is not on our OTA brand. So, there's still opportunity to do more in sharing the inventory we already possess. We've had no shortage of finding inventory, and I think, you know, housing market issues and other things probably make that, you know, macro easier now."", ""It's really just changing habits now. Our hedge against, you know, renting a mountain house or a beach house is, of course, renting a hotel, you know, or resort room in -- you know, as the alternative. And we've participated very well in that, and we feel good about our position there. But I think, you know, we feel very good about the product. You know, we needed to get the product to a new place."", ""We are now, you know, firmly on that journey. I don't think we gave space to anybody. I think, you know, we have a good brand. We have an improving product that I have no doubt will be best in class and -- and, you know, we just have to get back on offense. And, you know, again this is one of those places where you had to take a pause, you know, go slow to go fast."", ""And -- and the slow part always hurts a little, but you know, if you don't do it, you can never go fast. So -- so, we're in a good spot now, and I think we just have to accelerate out of it. And I don't worry about the supply situation. And I don't really think, you know, we're losing ground to, you know, other competitors who have some super sticky product. And over time, we should have the stickiest product because our product comes with loyalty, and our loyalty is usable across any travel product. So, I think that's a winning combination."", 'We just got to keep pounding at home now, and now that we have the product to get behind, we will do that.', 'Lee Horowitz -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Helpful. Thank you.', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great, thank you. I guess a couple for -- for Julie. You gave us the 11% growth for lodging and 18 for hotels, so we can kind of solve for -- for Vrbo. But can you give us any range of what percent your alternative accommodation nights are -- are bookings, just so we cannot have too big of a -- of a range there? And then, second, you know, last year, you were very clear double-digit top and bottom line.', 'I think you said similar growth on the top line and then margin improvement. I mean is -- is that kind of saying double digit for both, or do you want to clarify kind of the growth rates at all? Thank you.', 'Julie Whalen -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. On the first one, we haven't. And I think, recently, we haven't given out what percent is our, you know, Vrbo piece of the business. But I think, you know, once when we bought the company, there was some, you know, obviously numbers that were provided at that time."", ""You can do some extrapolation on the growth rate and get -- get pretty close probably. So, I don't think there's anything else that we would, you know, give out today from a disclosure perspective on that front. On the guidance perspective, you know, we basically have said, as you alluded to, that we are planning to grow relatively in line with our growth rates from this year, which is about, you know, 9.5, 10% in GBV and 10% on revenue. And then, we said, with margin expansion relatively in line, which you know, we're calling about 75 basis points for expansion this year. So, that's how I would take it. I mean relatively in line to us, you know, plus or minus 100 or so, you know, basis points, but that's how I'd think -- I'd think about it that it's both for GBV and revenue."", 'Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed, please go ahead.', 'Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', ""Yeah, hey. Thanks -- thanks for taking my question. Just going on to your overall marketing strategy, you know, just -- just by watching TV, I still see you're still marketing to a lot of the brands, Hotels.com, Expedia. And do you start to pivot those brands more into One Key? Can you talk about that? And then, can you just talk about your comments on streamlining expenses, sort of what's the strategy behind that move? Thank you."", 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jed. So, on the marketing front, yes, in the US, you will see all the brands advertised. It used to be far more brands.', ""You know, we're down to those core three, and we believe in those three. I think, you know, we're still trying to find the balance between, you know, can they be advertised as one or do they need to be advertised as three, and what is the best way to penetrate. So, I would think of that as sort of a, we're on our own learning journey about what we can do, how we can, you know, help people see them as a family of products that work together. And – and, you know, we continue to try to optimize, be it on television, which is what you're seeing, or in programmatic, you know, or frankly, even in metasearch and so forth. So, we're constantly working to see what the optimum way to drive those are."", ""But I will say, in the rest of the world, we have made very conscious decisions of where we will maintain one brand or, if -- if we think it's worth it, two or three brands, and -- and what we will do there, and we will lean heavily into, you know -- it's a high bar for there to be more than one. There has to be real brand affinity and other things that are driving that continuation of the second brand. So, especially now that, conceivably, any of our brands could have all or any lines of business, and that's not that hard for us to do. So, the opportunity to take, for example, a market that is a predominant Hotels.com market and potentially add car and air and other packages and other things is within our gift now."", ""And so, we can make quite different decisions about do we need to be in with Expedia just to have air or something else. So -- so, that's really a big opportunity for us and allows us to simplify how we think about those decisions and, in some ways, not replicate some of the complexity we've made for ourselves over the years. So, that's the work in progress. But, you know, all those things are effective, and we're working to, you know, optimize all the time on the best way to communicate that."", 'Maybe Julie can say something about the expense.', 'Julie Whalen -- Chief Financial Officer', ""And so, on the streamlining of expenses, I think we've been saying, you know, all last year that, you know, obviously, during the transformation phase, we've ramped up on expenses. We've had duplicate systems, you know, legacy systems where we're still building out the new system, and -- and all the costs that are associated with that across the board from cloud and licensing and maintenance and things like that. And so, we have said as we come out of this, you know, transformation phase that we think there's opportunity to deprecate systems and redeploy resources and find cost savings throughout the P&L. And so, this is our first, you know, sort of stab, if you will, at that, and you know, so you'll see things across the board coming out as we move throughout the year in cost of sales, in overhead. And to the extent that obviously crosses over into capital expenditures, you'll see some of the pressure coming off. At least the growth rates there, and if not -- and also in absolute dollars."", ""But that's simply what that represents. We're obviously not going to go into a lot of details today, but we did purposely say that we will give you more information later this quarter and as we move throughout the year on that as we give you more of the details associated with it."", 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. And I would just add --', 'Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', ""That's always been the plot that we wanted. This wasn't just to build cool new things; this was also to build them the right way and be efficient in how we did it. And -- and that's the opportunity that -- that -- you know, the transformation has also provided for us. And we're excited to be on that side of it, too, not just from a, you know, experience standpoint, but from an efficiency."", 'Jed Kelly -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our final question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.', 'Mark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""OK, thanks. I'm sure these questions have been covered, but if I could ask again, please. These two initiatives, the replatform -- the replatforming of the brands, particularly the Vrbo brand, and then the One Key strategy, is it -- I assume these are more like snowball events. Have you already seen an impact on the business or on-demand cross-selling retention acquisition from these so far? Or would you -- if not, could you lay out expectations of when we would? Thank you very much."", 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Mark, I'll give you a quick answer. I think we sort of addressed some of it already. But basically, the Vrbo transition to the -- to the unified stack is more of just a -- an execution thing. I think what it gives us is the opportunity now to accelerate Vrbo in terms of feature and test and learn and grow faster."", ""As I mentioned to -- to the -- to the rest of the group, we -- we dug a hole. We knew we would when we moved it to the new stack, the conversion would go down. We have been digging out of that hole. We're about back to par, but we didn't do it to get to par; we did it to accelerate far past that. And now, we have the opportunity in Vrbo riding on the same rails as the other brands, gets the benefit of all the testing -- shared testing opportunities that we -- winners that we found other places and so forth."", ""So, we're excited about the progression of that product, but it had to go through the bad to get to the good. As far as One Key goes, I also mentioned, we -- we feel very good about the early indicators. Yes, there is more cross-shopping. Yes, we're seeing more repeat from certain pools of customers that we thought would benefit from this, like Hotels.com customers who had less than 10 stamps in our old system, and people, if you will, who hadn't earned any benefit. Now, they have benefit and they're coming back more, and that's what we want to see."", ""But as I also mentioned, while millions of people have earned, you know, One Key cash on Vrbo, a small percentage of them have respent it. And that just has to do with the cycles of the booking windows for Vrbo and if people rarely book more than once or twice a year. So, we've got to get those, you know -- we expect to see those people back in. That's why I've said we've built up this value, and now that value needs to be realized as they come back direct later as they use that One Key cash across other brands with more cross-shopping, like, that's the dream, and of course, getting Expedia and Hotels.c`om members to use their One Key cash on Vrbo, which we've also seen. But, you know, again, those cycles aren't, you know, every month."", ""People do that once twice a year. So, we're seeing good early signals, but it's all building and that's why I'm excited like it's going to be a slow build, but it's going to be a great sticky thing for us over time. And, you know, again, we'll keep more and more -- as we get more of the right people in, as we keep more of them, and as they get to use, you know, all of our products, and again, we capture more wallet share from them, that's, you know -- that's what we're pushing for."", 'Mark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Thank you, Peter.', 'Peter Kern -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation, along with our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""Thank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. I will begin with a brief overview of Baxter's performance for the quarter and the year. After this, I will review our progress against the transformational actions we laid out for you just over a year ago, including the planned separation of our Kidney Care business. I will then turn it over to Joel Grade, who will walk through our results and outlook in more detail. Finally, we will open it up for your questions. As you saw this morning, Baxter reported strong performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 with top line sales exceeding our projections and bottom line results coming in at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, continuing operations exclude the impact of our biopharma solutions business, which we divested at the close of the third quarter. Sales from continuing operations rose 4% on a reported basis ahead of our outlook of 1% to 2% growth. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%, also ahead of our guidance, which projected a growth of approximately 1%. Strength in the quarter was broad-based with year-over-year growth in the health care systems and technologies, medical products and therapies and pharmaceuticals, which was slightly offset by an expected decline in Kidney Care. Relative to expectations, both of our Chronic Therapies and our Components divisions reported better-than-expected sales. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.88 at the top end of our prior guidance range of $0.85 to $0.88. Our fourth quarter results further reinforced our building momentum. In 2023, we focused on consistently meeting and/or exceeding our financial outlook, particularly in light of the significant supply chain and macro environmental challenges we encountered during 2022. As a testament to this focus, over the course of 2023, we were able to deliver sequential improvement every quarter, and we believe this performance provides us with a solid foundation to build off in 2024.Turning to the full year sales from continuing operations of $14.8 billion advanced 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by sales growth for all of our segments at constant currency rates. First, looking at the constant currency sales growth in the segment set to comprise our future Baxter portfolio following the planned Kidney Care separation. Sales in Healthcare Systems & Technologies were up 7% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year. Medical Products and Therapy sales rose 4% in both the quarter and for the year, and sales in Pharmaceuticals were up 7% for both the quarter and the year. Performance in these segments was filled by strong execution across our commercial and manufacturing teams. New product launches increased the availability of electromechanical component and a more stable supply chain and macroeconomic environment relative to the significant volatility experienced last year. With respect to hospital CapEX spending, while we still believe there may be pockets of softer spending, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement we experienced every quarter in 2023 within our Care and Connectivity Solutions division. Our Kidney Care segment, which will be called Vantive post separation, declined 1% in the quarter and grew 1% for the year at constant rates. Strong growth in Acute Therapies was offset by flat growth in chronic therapies, reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison due to certain discrete items that benefited sales in the prior year as well as lower sales in China due to the impact of government based procurement initiatives and the lower patient census due to the pandemic. The underlying state of the Kidney Care business continues to improve and the momentum we are building is evident. Among key indicators, we are seeing renewed growth in the peritoneal dialysis patient population following the earlier impact of pandemic-driven mortality issues. Our strategic rationale and hypothesis for an independent Kidney Care business remains as strong as ever. Our team is executing and gearing up for a successful separation this year. Given overall business performance and environmental dynamics, I'm optimistic as we look ahead to the prospects for both Baxter and Vantive as separate entities. Our solid financial performance was achieved in parallel with meaningful progress against the strategic priorities we announced to open 2023. We kicked off the year with an urgency to rethink both the scope and velocity of our transformation. Since then, our team delivered executing on a range of goals to position a separated Baxter and Vantive for a new era of enhanced patient and shareholder impact, enabled by heightened strategic clarity, operational efficiency and innovation. We realigned our businesses into newly streamlined simplified operating model based on globally integrated business segments. Each segment is led by a seasoned and knowledgeable executive who has profit and loss accountability, inclusive of dedicated commercial research and development, manufacturing, supply chain and functional teams. We are already seeing the benefits of improved line of sight to our customers and greater agility to recognize and capture growth opportunities. We completed the divestiture of our biopharma solutions business at the close of Q3, which further allowed us to streamline our strategic focus on our core businesses. We are in the process of utilizing the after-tax proceeds of approximately $3.7 billion to pay down debt in line with our stated capital allocation priorities, including $2.8 billion of repayments in the fourth quarter. Finally, we continue to make progress towards separating Vantive out of Baxter. As we have consistently stated, we believe this separation will ultimately empower both companies to pursue their own unique strategic and investment priorities. Many of you had the opportunity to meet designated Vantive's CEO, Chris Toth, at the JPMorgan conference last month. Chris has been hard at work building out his organization, meeting customers and setting near-term and long-term strategies. Among recent developments, Chris has onboarded Matthew Harbaugh as designated Vantive CFO. Many of you may know Matt from his days as CFO at NuVasive.Meanwhile, we continue to hit key separation milestones across operational, legal, regulatory, supply chain IT domains. In summary, 2023 was a year of rebuilding and renewing our momentum. We made significant progress on an ambitious slate of strategic initiatives coupled with solid financial performance while never losing focus on our foundational commitments to our customers and patients. Additionally, we have created a new potential to embrace more exciting opportunities to come. I do not take the accomplishments of this past year for granted. I want to thank and recognize all of the employees whose hard work and commitment helped us to achieve our objectives. I have never been more impressed by what a team could achieve in a single year, and that is why I'm so energized by our potential to seize on opportunities we have created together. Now we turn it over to Joel for a closer look at our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance as well as our 2024 outlook."", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call this morning to provide some additional details on Baxter's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance, as well as commentary on our financial outlook for 2024. As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which represented another step forward in our ongoing business transformation. Fourth quarter 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 4% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis and compared favorably to our previously issued guidance of 1% to 2% reported and approximately 1% constant currency. Outperformance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales in many product categories and particularly in chronic therapies and drug compounding.As compared to the prior year period, we reported solid quarterly growth in health care systems and technologies, pharmaceuticals and medical products and therapies. And collectively, sales for these 3 businesses, which will comprise Baxter post the separation, increased approximately 5%. As expected, Kidney Care sales declined slightly in the quarter due to the factors Joe mentioned earlier. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings totaled $0.88 per share, increasing 13% versus the prior year period. These results reflect the ongoing operational improvements we are recognizing both commercially as well as within our supply chain network as that team successfully executes on its margin improvement programs. Lower interest expense and a benefit from foreign exchange also contributed favorably to the quarter partially offset by the impact of a higher tax rate compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter came in at the high end of our expected range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share, primarily driven by better sales and operational performance. Now I'll walk through performance by our reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies segments were $1.3 billion, increasing 4%. Full year 2023 sales totaled $5 billion also advancing 4%. Within Medical products and therapies, fourth quarter sales from our Infusion Therapies and Technologies division totaled $1 billion and increased 4%. Sales in the quarter benefited from strength in our IV Solutions portfolio, particularly outside the United States as well as solid performance in our Infusion System portfolio. Sales from Advanced Surgery totaled $278 million and grew 6%, coming in ahead of expectations and reflecting strong growth internationally. For our Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST segment, sales in the quarter were $795 million and increased 7%. Full year 2023 sales totaled $3 billion, advancing 3%. Within the HST segment, sales in our Care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS division were $492 million, increasing 11%. Performance in the quarter benefited from double-digit growth in all key product categories within the division, including our care communications, surgical solutions and patient support systems product offerings. Growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower contribution from rental revenues. Fourth quarter United States orders within CCS continued to improve sequentially, but notably also grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time in 2023. While we are encouraged by the improvement in capital spending we've seen from our U.S. hospital customers, we continue to believe there may still be select pockets of cautiousness in the marketplace. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $303 million, increasing 2%. Given the improvements in electromechanical component availability over the course of 2023, we're able to successfully address our elevated backlog and exited the year at more normalized levels. Sales in our Pharmaceuticals segment were $596 million, increasing 7%. For the full year, sales were $2.2 billion, also advancing 7%. Performance in the quarter reflected double-digit growth in our U.S. injectables portfolio driven by new product launches as well as continued strong demand for our services within our drug compounding portfolio internationally. Other sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily include sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities were $18 million and declined 58% during the quarter, in line with our expectations. This lower level of sales reflects reduced demand for certain contract manufacturing volumes and the termination of a royalty arrangement. Moving on to Kidney Care. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion and declined 1%. Full year 2023 sales totaled $4.5 billion and increased 1%. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $950 million, declining 3%, though as mentioned earlier, came in better than expected. Sales growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year period, which included certain discrete items in the U.S. that totaled approximately $25 million. Finally, performance in chronic therapies continues to be impacted by lower sales in China due to certain government-based procurement initiatives and a lower patient census due to the pandemic. We estimate that collectively, these country-specific factors negatively impacted sales by approximately $35 million in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $206 million, representing growth of 6% with strength across most regions, including double-digit growth in the United States, where we've now rebased this business following the pandemic-related benefits we previously experienced. Now moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin totaled 42% and represented an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin primarily reflects the stabilization of macroeconomic factors and inflationary pressures that previously contributed to higher cost for raw materials, overhead and labor that impacted our margins earlier in the year. Margin improvement in the quarter also benefited from pricing initiatives in select markets and ongoing margin improvement programs in our integrated supply chain network. Performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations as top line outperformance in the quarter was driven by lower-margin divisions, which drove a slightly negative gross profit mix in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $829 million or 21.3 as a percentage of sales, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year period. Performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies, offset by higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans compared to the prior year, and select investments in sales and marketing initiatives. Adjusted research and development spending in the quarter totaled $172 million, and represented 4.4% as a percentage of sales, increasing 20 basis points versus the prior year. We have ramped up our R&D efforts, particularly increasing our investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and, like SG&A, R&D expenses include the impact of higher employee incentive accruals as compared to the prior year period. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 16.2%, an increase of 30 basis points. Overall, we are very pleased with the second half margin expansion we're able to realize with operating margins improving approximately 300 basis points in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of 2023. Net interest expense totaled $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of $44 million versus the prior year and down $55 million sequentially, driven by debt repayment of approximately $2.8 billion associated with the utilization of the proceeds from our BPS divestiture. We plan to continue to repay debt in 2024, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities. Adjusted other nonoperating income totaled $11 million in the quarter compared to an expense of $11 million in the prior year period. Year-over-year improvement was largely due to lower foreign exchange losses incurred as compared with the prior year period. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.0% compared to 14.6% in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by statute expirations on certain tax positions benefiting the prior year period. The tax rate in the quarter came in higher than expected, primarily driven by changes in geographic earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings totaled $0.88 and increased 13% versus the prior year, primarily driven by better-than-expected sales and operational efficiencies as well as lower interest expense, partially offset by the tax rate in the quarter. For the full year, Baxter's adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased 14% to $2.60 per diluted share, reflecting the impact of higher cost of goods sold driven primarily by the macro environmental factors we previously discussed, greater annual employee bonus accruals as well as increased nonoperating expenses. These factors were partially offset by our operational and supply chain savings initiatives. With respect to cash flow, we generated free cash flow for the year of over $1 billion from continuing operations compared to $411 million in the prior year period. Going forward, cash flow generation and, in particular, improving our working capital metrics is a key priority, both for me and the Baxter team. To close on our full year results, we are pleased with our operating performance through 2023, which reflected both consistent progress and building momentum. And it is important to note that our teams were able to achieve this performance while also making meaningful progress against our strategic initiatives designed to enhance our future performance and drive incremental value for all stakeholders. We look forward to building on that positive momentum as we enter 2024. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year 2024, Baxter expects total sales growth of 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, as the impact from foreign exchange is currently expected to be minimal on a full year basis. Constant currency sales guidance for the full year by reportable segments is as follows: for Medical Products and Therapies, we expect sales growth of 3% to 4%; sales in our Healthcare Systems and Technology segments are expected to increase approximately 3%; we expect Pharmaceuticals sales growth of 4% to 5%; collectively, sales for these remaining Baxter businesses are expected to increase 3% to 4% in 2024; for Kidney Care, we expect sales growth to decline 1% to 2% as compared to 2023. Factors impacting year-over-year growth are primarily driven by select market and product exits in connection with our margin expansion initiatives for this segment which we estimate will negatively impact sales by approximately $150 million. Additionally, the incremental impact from the ongoing government procurement initiatives in China is expected to total approximately $70 million in 2024. Now turning to our outlook for other P&L line items. We expect adjusted operating margin to increase by at least 50 basis points in 2024. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense to total approximately $350 million in aggregate during 2024. We anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate between 22.0% and 22.5%, which reflects an approximate 100 basis point impact to the 2024 tax rate from the implementation of Pillar Two. We expect our diluted share count to increase slightly and average 510 million shares for the year. Based on all these factors, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.85 to $2.95 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2024, we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% on a reported basis and 1% to 2% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.59 to $0.62 per diluted share. With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com. Our first question is from Travis Steed of Bank of America Securities.', 'Travis Lee Steed', ""I'll go ahead and ask both of mine upfront. One, on the revenue side. You talked about sequential improvement every quarter and when you look at the 2024 revenue guidance of 2%, maybe think through like some of the areas that could improve over the course of the year, where there could be some conservatism built then to the '24 and how to think about the cadence of the year? And the second question really is on margins, if you think about the 50 basis point margin guidance. Curious what some of the underlying assumptions are on FX and inflationary pressures and stuff like that?"", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Travis, this is Joel. Thank you for the call. So I guess I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we feel very good about the momentum in our business. I think we had a -- we saw a solid fourth quarter. We are pleased with some of the results that we have heading into this year. And I think the revenue guidance that you see, if you think about overall, the business outside of Kidney is growing 3% to 4% that we have, as we've talked about our forecast. With Kidney itself, if you think about that, we actually have about -- there's about $150 million of purposeful business that we're actually exiting products, we're exiting markets. And so if you actually factor that into that equation, again, we're up over that 3% number for the year, which I think is great. If you think about the full year guidance itself, a couple some of that strong sales performance with the fact that we're actually expanding our margins by over 50 basis points and we're actually leading to double-digit BPS growth. We feel really good about that. Now on the margin side, to answer the question you asked, I think the main puts and takes in that -- the main part is the operational cost improvements in that. There's a big piece of that from also pricing, from volume. And again, so I think some of the things that you have in there are some of the key assumptions on the margins. I think in all those areas, we feel good about the opportunities again to build on momentum we've had. If you remember in the last quarter, our HST business, we're very pleased with the momentum we had from a sales perspective in Q4, and we do anticipate that heading into the year as well. So again, lots of good stuff there, but I'll pause there for any other points that (inaudible)."", 'Clare Trachtman', ""Yes. Travis, I'll add in a little bit here. So in terms of the cadence, I would say if we think about just the shape of the P&L, I think sales will be relatively -- you'll see some slight acceleration in the second half of the year. But in terms of margin expansion, you are going to see first half margin expansion more outsized than you will see in the second half, obviously, just given the comp, and similarly, you'll see that on earnings growth. So earnings growth in the first half of the year will be very strong. Your question on FX, Travis, was FX is negative on margins for the year, about 40 basis points of an impact on our operating margins on a year-over-year basis."", 'Operator', 'Robert Marcus of JPMorgan has a question.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is [Allen] on for Robbie. I had a question on some of the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter and a little bit of the softer first quarter guide. Was there any pull forward of sales into this quarter? You talked about how you recovered some of the backlogs. So I expect some of that drove the outsized strength. But also just looking at first quarter, given what we view as an easy comp, why aren't you able to put up a better growth number at the start of the year? How much of that is conservatism versus realism?"", 'Clare Trachtman', ""Yes. So what I would say is probably one of the biggest drivers in terms of the quarterly cadence is within our HST business, where sales do ramp over the course of the year. So very similar to what we saw in 2023. You will see our HST business have growth -- accelerated growth in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. So I think that's probably one of the bigger drivers in terms of the first quarter guidance."", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""And also, we are continuing to see momentum from 2023 into 2024. So I feel cautiously optimistic about the momentum that we got in Q4 going into Q1. Of course, we look at many different factors when we are guiding. But I can tell you that based on the market growth, some of the demand that we're seeing, we feel very comfortable with Q1. And also, we have always had crescendo throughout the year, where we have product launches. We have 10 molecules launching in pharmaceutical. They're starting this quarter that we see ramping throughout Q2, Q3 and Q4. And also, there are some very important accounts that we -- is still closing on for the rest of the year that we will also boost our ability to do well in 2024."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Got it. And then if I could slip in a quick one. You talked about the capital equipment environment continuing to improve some pockets of weakness. What are you assuming for 2024 in the guidance? Are you expecting continued little bits of pockets of weakness? Or are you having that basically normalized over the course of the year?', 'Jose E. Almeida', ""Most of our assumptions are large system -- medium to large systems continue to improve. We can see that, and we're going to see that slightly in Q1, but going into Q2, Q3 and Q4. There are pockets of softness in capital like always are, primarily smaller systems. Remember, interest rates are still very high and those affect the smaller systems. But for the majority of our customers, we're starting to see a recovery in capital when we feel really comfortable in 2024 that is recovering completely from what we saw in the beginning of -- end of '22 into '23."", 'Clare Trachtman', ""Yes. And [Allen], just to add on to that. Similarly, I think we will see sequential improvement for capital orders within our CCS business every quarter this year, leading to orders being up on a year-over-year basis. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks, we saw a very similar trend kind of in 2023 as well. And then in the fourth quarter, we did see our orders up on a year-over-year basis. So we've been seeing this steady sequential improvement. And so we're going to build on that momentum as we go into 2024."", 'Operator', 'Matt Miksic of Barclays is on the line with a question.', 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', 'Can you hear me okay?', 'Jose E. Almeida', 'Yes, we can.', 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', ""Great. So I had -- congrats on the solid results here and the pickup in the old Hillrom business. So I just have a question on the seasonality of that business. And also if you could maybe just to the extent of recurring revenues in that business. And I think we're used to a history there being capital driven, Q4 driven. But with some of the increase in sort of contracting around connected care and systems that -- I'm wondering, is that a mix of recurring revenue that we should see over time? Or you're starting to see a mix change in that business? Any color on that front would be super helpful."", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""So we always have the seasonality. We see hospitals a little bit more cautious in the first quarter. And then as they get through the first quarter, they start spending the money that they have for the year and it culminates usually with a strong Q4 in terms of growth because a lot of spending gets done there. We try to, as much as possible, create more -- a less seasonality, but those things happen and our (inaudible). I think one important program we have in Baxter, as you noticed, is strength in our beds in the fourth quarter.We continue to go for some large accounts and conversions and we're starting to get some success there. When we bring Baxter together, what Baxter can do as one company is incredible for hospitals. So we feel that, that momentum is starting to kick in with accounts that are partially penetrated, going full blow into a Baxter account. We saw that with the conversion that we get this kind of launch in early 2025 in Northern Cal that we have large accounts and other things that we can see. So this is a really good momentum for Baxter. We can see that going.But the first quarter is always, is always a much lighter quarter than the rest of the year. The revenue in terms of Front Line Care is a business that has less seasonality than the CCS business under HST. The reason is that it's more consistent with procurement in doctors' offices and monitors into hospital Med-Surg floors. So that brings less seasonality.A business that is very predictable is our MPT business, which has been successfully growing, as you can see in 2023. 150 basis points above its market growth rate, driven tremendously by infusion systems as well as solutions, IV solutions. So that brings that business to a quite less seasonable, more repeatable. I hope I was able to answer your question."", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Yes. If I could just add one thing to that. I mean I think the way to think about that HSD business over the course of the year and then just to build on what Joe said is that we're going to see, I'd say, sequential ramp up over the course of the year in that business. So I think the -- again, as Clare talked a little bit earlier, I mean there's going to be somewhat of a ramp up in sales that you're going to see, and that's particularly going to be applicable to that segment.The other thing I would just say, you recall last year, Front Line Care had a fairly sizable amount of growth in 2023 as they worked through some of the backlog. There's a bit of an early headwind on that business during the first part of the year as well. So again, sequential ramp-up in that business is just I want to add out, Matthew, to that."", 'Operator', 'Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI is on the line with a question.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Joe, maybe my first one for you. High level when I just look at the business ex-Kidney Care. 3% to 4%, that's a reasonable number, but it's still below Medtech, right? When I look at the utilization environment, what some of your peers are talking about. Like why is Baxter 3% to 4%? Are there any one-offs in that 3% to 4% ex-Kidney Care. When I look at the legacy Hillrom business, Q4 was really strong. Why should that business slow down if capital order book is turning around in fiscal '24?"", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""Vijay, let me give you a perspective on 3% to 4% for this business. It's still growing above its market growth rate because we expect to be on the high end of that guidance. What makes that business go 100 basis points above that? We have, first of all, this business has pharmaceutical in it. We still have price erosion there, but pharmaceutical is going to be punching 4% to 5%. Our MPT is going to be between 3% and 4% and probably with the opportunity to go above that.Now becomes HST. What is happening in HST? We have significant amount of launches going in at the end of '24 and '25. We have new monitors. We have new cardiology device and we continue to be successful on Progressa+. So a lot of that has to do with our -- to get to the 4% to 5%, it has to be new product launches in 2025, now for pharmaceutical. Because then you can see already it's making a difference to their growth rate. It's now for MPT, which is -- continues to do extremely well in Infusion Systems. We're going to have than 40% growth between '24 and '23 in our infusion pumps. It's going to be new products in HSV, primarily in Front Line Care and CCS with care communications, new versions of Voalte, there is the 3 new versions will be launched this year, as well as our new wireless communication device that we plan to launch in 2025. So monitors, wireless communication and cardiology, that is what's going to drive that business to go above 4%. And if we execute well, you will do it."", 'Joel T. Grade', ""I would also say too. If you think about the -- as we separate the Kidney business and we talk about later on in this year, having an investor event. What you're going to hear us talk about is how we think about capital allocation. How we think about the opportunity for, again, the portfolio ultimately too. Because think about, we have a lot of products with very high market share businesses. And so the opportunity to accelerate that growth is something we're going to talk about later on. But again, that's part of the benefit of the Kidney separation is the ability to actually really focus our capital allocation on accelerating the growth to the levels that you're thinking about there."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Understood. And then maybe one on the guidance question. What is -- is inflation still a headwind to margins? What is price versus inflation and interest expense Q4? You didn't note the sequential step down in debt payments. Is that a sustainable number?"", 'Clare Trachtman', ""So you want me to -- I'll start with interest. What I would say, Vijay, on interest is that in the first half of the year, it's probably, I'd say, first quarter, probably similar. It steps up likely a little bit in the second quarter, and then we'll step up in the second half of the year. We are planning to pay down some low coupon debt in the second quarter.And so right now, we're earning some cash -- or earning interest income on the cash that we have, and so that will go away in the second half of the year. So that's why you'll see a bit of a higher interest expense in the second half of the year as compared to the first half."", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Yes. And on the debt paydown, I mean, again, we -- of the $3.7 billion of proceeds after tax we got from the sale of BPS, we actually used $2.8 million of that to pay down debt in the fourth quarter. Again, we have some debt coming due that's maturing in 2024 that we will use some of the rest of that for, particularly the Eurobond as Clare talked about. And then obviously, we have some debt maturing later in the year that we'll actually address at that point in time."", 'Clare Trachtman', 'And then to your other question, kind of just on overall the inflationary environment and pricing. What I would say, and we referenced this earlier, is that our integrated supply chain team is executing on their margin improvement program. And so those programs and the savings we will generate this year will positively contribute to our margin expansion. So they will more than offset any sort of normalized inflation that we have.In addition, we are getting -- pricing will be a benefit this year as well. So we are getting pricing, particularly in markets outside the U.S., as well. So we are going after all of those -- our businesses are targeting price in all of those markets as well. So pricing will be positive for the year as well.In terms of kind of all of those pieces, what I would say on the non-op side is that you have a positive on interest, but you will see that our tax rate is increasing. We did comment on that because of the implementation of Pillar Two FX. So we have some FX. I talked about it being kind of negative on the operating margin. So all in, our non-op is probably -- probably about a couple of cents negative impact for us on the year.', 'Operator', 'Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank Securities is on the line with a question.', 'Philip Chickering', ""Joel, like you've been in that seat for very long, but I just think a fresh set of eyes on the operations of Baxter. Can you walk us where you think the most margin upside is over the next several years? And what you need to do to hit those cost reductions. Any areas that you want to hit like procurement or any other sort of low-hanging fruit?"", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Sure. Absolutely. Thanks a lot for the question. Yes, I think one of the biggest opportunities we have from a margin perspective is to continue the work that we're doing in our independent supply chain group. I think the team has got a lot of really good margin improvement programs going that are designed specifically around things like automation. They're designed around things like how do we enhance our procurement abilities. They're around -- continuing around things about how do we optimize our network and some of the logistics opportunities.I think some of the areas that are the most impactful over time sit in that space, again -- and that's -- the team has gotten off to, again, a really good start on that. You've heard Clare talk about the fact that as we continue to see some inflationary pressures coming out, I think the work that they've done has gotten us to a place where we have the ability to offset that. But to continue the expansion of the margins, to your point, fall into some of those categories that I just referred to.I think the other piece of some of you heard me say this already. We're not going to SG&A ourselves to prosperity. But nonetheless, there are still opportunities in that space as well around things like, again, how do we think about a shared services environment that actually allows for consistent execution of operations across the business. And I know this is not a margin question, but the other part of what we're going to focus on heavily is our -- is cash that we will continue to -- how do we drive an improved use of working capital? How do we improve our cash conversion ratio again? I know that's not specifically what you asked. But again, that's going to be an area I see the opportunity.And what that all leads to is then the opportunity for us to continue to reinvest some of that back into our business around innovation, around new product development. And back to the question that was asked earlier, how do we continue to accelerate growth. That's what I call a flywheel that allows us to continue to grow, continue to invest and continue to grow, et cetera, et cetera, which is where we want to get to this company."", 'Philip Chickering', ""Great. And then for a follow-up, you opened Pandora's box a little bit here by providing segment level margins for 4Q in 2023. Now we're going to be looking possibly to rebuild their models. Can you break out sort of the margins in each division for what you're seeing for 2024? And then a quick pump question here, how is market share for pumps in 4Q as you compete against next-gen pumps and any update on Novum?"", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""Let me start with the pumps and then Clare is going to answer the first part of your question. Yesterday, we just got awarded best-in-class KLAS for our Sigma Spectrum pump, which is a great honor. That pump continues to do a great job. Nonetheless, we're looking forward to get Novum approved. But in terms of market share, we continue to advance our market share. This year, we have 40-plus percent growth in our pumps versus last year. That's our forecast. So we continue to do well, and we look forward to continue to gain market share and now with a nice award to our pump. It's the seventh award that, that pump received since it was launched. So back to Clare now to answer the first part of your question."", 'Clare Trachtman', ""Yes. Pito, in terms of the 2024 operating margin guidance, we aren't going to give that by segment. But obviously, all of our actions are aligned to improve both the segment and total Baxter margins. The one caveat I would point out is that within our Pharmaceuticals business, as you're aware, we did divest our BioPharma Solutions business last year. And so as a result, we entered into some MSAs, which will have a negative impact on the pharmaceutical margins and obviously on total Baxter margins for the year as we've now entered into the MSA. So you will see that impact in the pharmaceuticals margins."", 'Operator', 'Lawrence Biegelsen of Wells Fargo is on the line with a question.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""It's [Lei] calling in for Larry. I just want to make sure I didn't miss it. Did you comment on the status of Novum IQ, the resubmission, and your thoughts on potential approval in '24? And I have a follow-up?"", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""I didn't comment on the details, and we usually don't comment on anything that is with the FDA on behalf of the FDA. We can tell you that we answered all their questions. There's no other questions to be answered. All the documentation was submitted. So as always, this is at their side now to make a final decision on this.But as I said before and I said this about a month or so ago, I feel cautiously optimistic because there is nothing else for us to do. We answered all the questions. So there will be -- if that happen in '24, it will be a great thing. Nevertheless, we continue to gain market share for SIGMA SPECTRUM. As I said before, we just got an award, a best-in-class for that pump, and we're very happy, and we continue to be very busy quoting new accounts and competitive accounts, which we are actually winning with that pump."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Got it. And my follow-up is just on your -- what you said about expectations for the 2 segments in '24. So Baxter ex-Renal, you expect 3% to 4% growth. Is that the right way to look at -- is that the right way to look at it longer term? And similarly, in the Renal business itself, you're expecting 1% to 2% decline this year. But once you adjust for the exits in China VBP, does Renal normalized to kind of low single-digit growth longer term?"", 'Clare Trachtman', ""Yes. So [Lei], I'm going to go back to something that Joel mentioned earlier. We plan to have a Capital Markets Day later this year, where we will discuss our long-term expectations for the business. And -- but I think that both Joe and Joel have said that, while we're growing 3% to 4% through the introduction of new products, continued market expansion, our goal is to grow ahead of our weighted average market growth rate. So we do want to grow in advance of that. And so we'll be unveiling kind of those longer term. But no, I would say our goal is to accelerate growth off of that.With respect to Kidney Care, again, yes, we made $150 million of exits to that business, all aligned with our goal of enhancing profitability for that business post separation. So I think that what we want to ensure is that we're setting this business up for success as a stand-alone entity.We also have the value-based procurement. There might be some follow-on to that in 2025. But I think the key is that the fundamentals for this business are improving. We're seeing solid patient growth. We're seeing a rebound in our Acute Therapies business. So I believe this business can accelerate at the levels -- that will grow at the levels that we're seeing once we make these adjustments."", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Yes. And I would just -- the question you asked, the -- we did again make purposeful decisions around exiting markets, exiting products. And so if you actually add that back from that $150 million we referred to earlier, I think, yes, you would find yourself in a place where there's a -- where the growth is actually in the low single digits."", 'Operator', 'Matt Taylor of Jefferies is on the line with a question.', 'Matthew Charles Taylor', ""I know you noted some progress on pricing. I was wondering if you could comment on that in your expectations for pricing in '24. And any updates on some of those bigger contracts that you've talked about in the past and your opportunities to reprice solutions, dialysis, nutrition, et cetera?"", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Yes. Sure. So we did make progress in pricing in 2023. And some of that was -- were temporary in nature in the sense that we had some adds to pricing that will again fall off at the end of the year here. But we do have part of our growth and our margin expansion in 2024, that is continuing progress in the areas of pricing. And I think one of the things that we've talked about is -- just as a reminder, some of the contracts with the GPOs that we've signed, we've made continued progress on them. That actually doesn't kick in until 2025. So just to just to remind you of that, that that's not part of what we're talking about in terms of progress.But again, the team has made solid progress in terms of continuing to take pricing in 2024. And the other thing I would say that we've done a good job already and are going to continue to do an even better job of, is to give ourselves the opportunities to actually have indexes within our pricing that allow us more flexibility to pass along costs that are coming into our world that we have historically struggled to pass along to our customers. Again, we're making progress in that area as well.So generally speaking, as Clare talked about, our expansion margins really is focused around some of the operational work that we're doing, but also, again, our pricing progress continues in 2024, and we look to accelerate that further in 2025 and beyond."", 'Matthew Charles Taylor', ""So I just ask a follow-up. I mean when can we hear more about the bigger contracts? Are you going to talk about that throughout the year? And can you comment at all on the kind of opportunities you have with some of those contracts, what's the order of magnitude of pricing you could get?"", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""We are making great progress. We're in the middle of doing it. Once these contracts are signed, the next steps for us to secure the IDNs underneath them and Baxter do well on that. We are well poised to take that action. We are feeling quite comfortable where we are today in terms of signing these agreements. We're not going to tell exactly the status of -- where we are signing them for competitive reasons, neither the volume of dollars.So you need to think about this as value. Value is -- dropping profit to the bottom line is value. That will be achieved with pricing and volume. Volume is important to us, the size of our plants. So we're getting a combination of both is the important thing for us. So our focus price is always important because the amount of headwind that we had in 2022, of course. So we are considering that, but also expansion of market share is important to us as well because we have capacity and have been serving the market very well. So think about our objective in 2024 into 2025 is to continue to add value and significant accretion potentially to the bottom line by getting those contracts signed, but we are in good position."", 'Joel T. Grade', ""And we're not going to give specific details on the pricing or volume, as Joe referenced. So just think about that as guidance that we ultimately give on margins and volume growth will be inclusive of the progress we'll make with those contracts."", 'Operator', 'Danielle Antalffy of UBS is on the line with a question.', 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""And just a quick question on sort of what the longer-term focus is post Kidney Care? I assume we'll get some more color here once we have the pre-spin Analyst Day. But just at a high level, Joe and Joel, curious about where you see the most opportunities to improve whether organically or inorganically from an R&D perspective? And just longer term, i.e., over the next few years, where you think Baxter will be most focused and investing behind?"", 'Jose E. Almeida', ""So Danielle, we're thinking about the strategy and the overarching imperative of this strategy is to advance and significantly improve the intrinsic value of the company. And we're going to do that organically and eventually inorganically as well with some tuck-ins and strategic acquisitions that will supplement some of our business. But -- so in the organic side to drive that, that intrinsic value multiplier is innovation, acceleration of innovation, expansion of our commercial footprint in areas that we currently don't participate well, as well as doubling down in operations excellence in all of our -- in all aspects of Baxter from the plants all the way to our back office.So creating value in all parts of the company. So we can take some of that money, reinvest modestly in research and development and continue to accelerate the innovation. And the innovation, all of this is going to be done with a significant amount of importance to capital allocation, meaning where money goes inside of the company, how much is share buyback.So this is a post spin when we are looking at a different debt structure and a different company past that. So think about our strategy, to accelerate innovation, accelerate penetration in commercial areas. We're not like alternate sites of care, ASCs. Those are the drivers of our organic growth, and that should drive a request for a multiplier on our intrinsic value as a company."", 'Clare Trachtman', ""And Danielle, just to follow on and specific to kind of Kidney Care. What I would say is within Kidney Care, and obviously, Chris Toth will elaborate more on this. But they're going to focus on continuing to increase PD penetration globally. Really focusing on how do they enhance this digitally as well and what digital capabilities are out there to really help both clinicians and patients advance that therapy. In addition, within the acute therapies business, I think they'll continue to build upon the continued renal replacement therapy and broaden into more multi-organ support therapies as well. So I think that they have a strategy there that they'll continue to build upon and execute as a stand-alone entity."", 'Joel T. Grade', ""Yes. And I just think what Joe said and what Clare has talked about is just reinforcement of the strategic rationale for the separation that then allows us and Kidney, frankly, to both focus their capital allocation on those areas that really accelerate their growth. And as Joe said, I see that (inaudible) debt is at a level that we've targeted to actually reinforce this idea that we're going to have both organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call with Baxter International. Thank you for participating.""]"

GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with BAX.', ""On February 8, 2024, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) filed its annual 10-K report, providing a detailed overview of its financial performance and strategic direction. The company, a leading provider of medical instruments and supplies, has recently undergone significant strategic actions, including the acquisition of Hillrom and the proposed spinoff of its Kidney Care business. Baxter's financial tables reveal a stable revenue generation with $4.45 billion from its Kidney Care segment in both 2023 and 2022, accounting for approximately 30% of its consolidated net sales. The divestiture of its BioPharma Solutions (BPS) business brought in cash proceeds of $3.96 billion, bolstering the company's financial position. This SWOT analysis delves into Baxter's internal and external factors that influence its competitive edge and future growth prospects."", ""Robust Product Portfolio and Innovation: Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) stands out for its diversified healthcare products, which cater to a wide range of medical needs. The company's strengths are rooted in its ability to innovate and expand its product offerings. For instance, the acquisition of Hillrom has significantly enhanced Baxter's portfolio, particularly in connected care solutions like smart bed systems and patient monitoring technologies. The company's focus on innovation is evident in its investment in new product launches and geographic expansions, such as smart pump technology and surgical sealants. These initiatives not only demonstrate Baxter's commitment to growth but also position it as a leader in medical technology."", ""Global Presence and Market Expansion: Baxter's global footprint is a testament to its strength, with manufacturing in over 20 countries and products sold in over 100. The company's strategic pillar of market expansion has been successful in leveraging its geographic reach to introduce products into new markets and increase the adoption of underpenetrated therapies. This global presence not only diversifies revenue streams but also mitigates risks associated with market-specific downturns. Baxter's ability to navigate international markets and regulatory landscapes is a competitive advantage that supports its long-term growth."", ""Operational Complexity and Integration Challenges: Despite its strengths, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) faces challenges related to the complexity of its operations, particularly following the integration of Hillrom. The company has acknowledged the need for a new operating model to simplify operations and better align manufacturing with commercial activities. This transition period could present risks in terms of operational efficiency and cost management. Additionally, the integration process may lead to short-term disruptions that could impact Baxter's service delivery and customer relationships."", ""Dependence on Kidney Care Segment: Baxter's reliance on its Kidney Care segment, which accounted for about 30% of its consolidated net sales, is a potential weakness. The planned spinoff of this segment into an independent company by mid-2024 could lead to short-term financial instability and necessitate a strategic realignment. While the spinoff is aimed at enhancing stockholder value, it also exposes Baxter to the risks of losing a significant revenue contributor and the need to strengthen other segments to compensate for this change."", ""Connected Care and Digital Health Expansion: The healthcare industry's shift towards digitalization presents significant opportunities for Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX). The company's acquisition of Hillrom, with its digitally connected offerings like smart beds and medical communications apps, positions Baxter at the forefront of the connected care revolution. The growing demand for telehealth and remote patient monitoring solutions could drive Baxter's growth in this space, as healthcare providers seek to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency through technology."", ""Strategic Divestitures and Capital Allocation: Baxter's recent strategic actions, including the sale of its BPS business and the proposed spinoff of its Kidney Care business, reflect a deliberate capital allocation strategy. These moves are expected to streamline Baxter's operations and focus on higher-margin segments. The capital raised from these divestitures provides Baxter with the financial flexibility to invest in growth areas, reduce debt, and potentially return value to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases."", 'Competitive Landscape and Pricing Pressures: Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) operates in a highly competitive medical products market, where innovation and pricing are key differentiators. The company faces competition from both established players and new entrants, which could lead to pricing pressures and reduced market share. Baxter must continuously innovate and offer cost-effective solutions to maintain its competitive position and address the risk of declining demand in certain product categories.', ""Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The medical device and healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and Baxter is subject to stringent quality and safety standards. Compliance with these regulations is critical to the company's operations. Any quality issues or regulatory non-compliance could result in product recalls, legal penalties, and damage to Baxter's reputation. Additionally, changes in healthcare policies and reimbursement rates could impact the demand for Baxter's products and services, posing a threat to its financial stability."", ""In conclusion, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) exhibits a strong market position with its diversified product portfolio, global presence, and strategic focus on innovation and market expansion. However, the company must navigate operational complexities, reliance on its Kidney Care segment, and the competitive landscape. Opportunities in connected care and strategic capital allocation present avenues for growth, while regulatory challenges and pricing pressures remain significant threats.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' See our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Johnson & Johnson had US$29.9b of debt in October 2023, down from US$39.7b, one year before. However, it also had US$23.5b in cash, and so its net debt is US$6.41b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Johnson & Johnson had liabilities of US$44.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$50.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$23.5b in cash and US$14.8b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$56.5b.', 'Of course, Johnson & Johnson has a titanic market capitalization of US$380.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.', 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).', ""Johnson & Johnson has a low debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.22. But the really cool thing is that it actually managed to receive more interest than it paid, over the last year. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson's EBIT dived 14%, over the last year. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Johnson & Johnson's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Johnson & Johnson recorded free cash flow worth 72% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate."", ""Happily, Johnson & Johnson's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But we must concede we find its EBIT growth rate has the opposite effect. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Johnson & Johnson can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Johnson & Johnson   you should know about."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.57 per share on $15.81 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 8.72% and 6.4%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Republic Services may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Republic Services has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 29.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 22.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.4X versus its peer group's average of 8.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.9. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', 'We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Republic Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.', 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Republic Services fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Republic Services shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.', 'How Does RSG Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of RSG have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Waste Management, Inc. (WM). WM has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. Waste Management, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 1.24%, and for the current fiscal year, WM is expected to post earnings of $6.72 per share on revenue of $20.39 billion.', 'Shares of Waste Management, Inc. have gained 6% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 28.29X and a P/CF of 17.44X.', 'The Waste Removal Services industry is in the top 42% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for RSG and WM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even with that high level of trust, only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults have “a great deal” of confidence that airplanes are being properly maintained, or that they are safe from structural faults. Another half have a “moderate” amount of faith that this is the case.', ""The poll was conducted after a Jan. 5 accident in which a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliner 16,000 feet (4,900 meters) above Oregon, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. That led to the grounding of more than 140 planes and raised questions about Boeing's ongoing manufacturing problems as well as the Federal Aviation Administration's ability to address them."", ""U.S. adults are more confident in airline pilots' and air traffic controllers' ability to maintain air safety than they are in the commercial airlines, airplane manufacturers or federal government agencies charged with it. A majority have at least a “moderate” amount of confidence that each is ensuring safety."", 'Some with fears of flying expressed even more concern because of the Alaska Airlines incident.', ""“I don't enjoy flying.

The plane landed safely and there were no serious injuries among the 171 passengers and six crew members.', ""Lindquist filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines on behalf of four passengers in Washington state's King County Superior Court last month, accusing the companies of negligence.

After the pilot checked cockpit instruments and found readings to be normal, no further action was taken, the complaint says.', 'In a phone interview with The Associated Press, Lindquist said he became aware of the new claims after “a couple” of people contacted his law firm. He did not specify who they were and declined to confirm whether they were passengers or crew members on the previous flight. He said he did not speak with them directly, but learned of their “whistling sound” allegations through his legal team.

Door plugs are panels that are inserted where emergency exit doors would be located on Max 9s with more than about 200 seats.', 'The report did not say who removed the bolts. The NTSB did not declare a probable cause for the detachment — that will come at the end of an investigation that could last a year or longer.', 'The jetliner was also restricted from long flights over water after a warning light that could have indicated a pressurization problem lit up on three different flights, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said last month.

But he also said it was plausible that passengers on previous flights heard such a noise, given its prior pressurization issues.', '“We know that the bolts were missing. ... So this sound makes sense,” Loranger said. “If they heard that whistling noise, that’s very possible to have been an indication that the aircraft had some small leaks around the seal and that it wasn’t keeping pressure properly.""', 'After the incident on the Alaska jet, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded most Max 9s for three weeks until it approved a process for inspecting door plugs. The agency is investigating whether Boeing and its suppliers followed proper safety procedures in manufacturing parts for the Max.', 'Alaska and United are the only U.S. airlines that fly Max 9s.

Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, I joined Illumina as CEO a little over 4 months ago. In this time, part of my focus has been on meeting with customers to understand their priorities, hear their feedback and develop more collaborative relationships. Our customer thinks highly of Illumina and our solutions, and they want to work in strategic partnerships with us to move the whole NGS ecosystem forward. Now that we have announced that we will divest GRAIL, it has been easier for our customers to plan what their future looks like with Illumina.These meetings have been instructive and inspiring. During my recent trip to Europe, I was able to see firsthand how we are working with our customers, governments and the broader genomics community to accelerate whole genome sequencing adoption safely and more effectively and to understand rare diseases and cancers as a part of the standard of care. I've also learned about Germany's model project that aims to fully integrate comprehensive genomic testing into the health care system there beginning in Q2 this year.Within the hallways of our headquarters and in several global offices, I have also been connecting with our talented employees who are committed to driving innovation and continuing to build out the genomics ecosystem.I've also had an opportunity to engage with many of you at recent investor conferences. These conversations are informing my leadership agenda and importantly, having reinforced my confidence in Illumina's core business.2023 was a dynamic year for Illumina. NovaSeq X has been the most successful high-throughput product launch in our history. We ended the year with 352 NovaSeq X shipments, above the 330 to 340 we expected, amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop that we saw many of our customers remaining constrained in their purchasing decisions.In the fourth quarter, we delivered higher-than-expected consolidated revenue of approximately $1.12 billion. Americas revenue, which is more than half of our business was flat year-on-year. Europe revenue was up 17% year-on-year on a relatively easy prior year comparable. EMEA revenue declined 1%, although that included a 10 percentage point impact from sanctions in Russia. Greater China revenue was down 13% year-on-year reflecting continued geopolitical challenges and local competition in mid-throughput.As I've noted before, China and our customers there are important to Illumina. We've already taken certain pricing and other strategic actions that are beginning to yield results. We will share more specifics on our progress there over time.Globally, we expect our customers will remain cautious. And for now, we continue to expect 2024 results to look very similar to 2023. While some macro headlines are encouraging, we haven't yet seen that translate to increased investment in our industry and therefore, have not reflected it in our guidance. Joydeep will take you through more details in our guidance in a few minutes.While we cannot control the external environment, the management team and I remain committed to accelerating value creations across the enterprise. As you are aware, I have laid out 3 key priorities that I believe will position Illumina for accelerated growth and profitability as market conditions improve. My first priority, driving our top line, is centered on continuing to grow our installed base and helping customers accelerate utilization of these instruments in new and existing applications. I discussed earlier how pleased we are with the first year of NovaSeq X shipments. For high throughput more broadly, across the NovaSeq X and NovaSeq 6000, we placed more than 400 instruments in 2023.In 2024, we will support this growing installed base as customers launch large projects and more sequencing-intensive applications like multiomics, liquid biopsy and minimal residual disease, or MRD. We anticipate ongoing high throughput instrument orders throughout 2024, primarily coming from further conversion of NovaSeq 6000 customers to the X, from customer fleet expansions and long term, from new to high-throughput customers. With that said, given the significant number of placements in 2023, we believe we will ultimately shift fewer high-throughput instruments in 2024. As you're aware, XLEAP-SBS chemistry has been the engine for our X platform, delivering significant improvements in quality, turnaround time and cost. This quarter, we will be making XLEAP available to our mid-throughput customers under existing NextSeq 1000, 2000 instruments without having to upgrade their instruments. This offering will further strengthen our leadership position around the world and drive progress in markets such as single cell, spatial and proteomics.As we grow installed base, we will remain focused on supporting our customers as they launch new projects. This will build momentum for consumables demand this year and going forward. Already, our efforts to develop this demand is paying off. In Q4, we saw higher-than-expected growth in ex consumable sales following the late October launch of our much anticipated 25B rating kit. More recently, in January, we launched a 1.5B kit, which, together with the 25B and the 10B flow cells, allows us to offer a full suite of products to the NovaSeq X customers. While we will continue to see customers reduce their inventories of NovaSeq 6000 consumables as they transition to the X, building pull-through on the NovaSeq X will drive our overall high throughput consumables growth this year.Turning to my second priority. I'm focused on delivering operational excellence by applying greater rigor throughout our P&L, while sustaining innovation and growth. We have launched a multiyear effort focusing on improving our margins through greater productivity and pursuing additional areas for cost savings. In January, we took an additional action to further optimize our global workforce. Over the past year, we have made cumulative role reductions totaling approximately 12%. Our most recent actions included an adjustment that we aligned with our late 2023 portfolio optimization efforts. You'll see us continue to take steps to not only manage our near-term cost but also to build our agility to deliver more sustained growth and margins over time.Illumina is taking a highly disciplined approach to support our customers, employees and partners and to deliver shareholder returns throughout a range of macroeconomic environments.Moving to my third priority, which is working to resolve GRAIL as quick as possible. Since joining Illumina, I've made it an imperative to move with speed on GRAIL. In December, we announced that we would divest GRAIL with a goal of finalizing the terms of the transaction by the end of the second quarter this year. We'll continue to pursue parallel path. The divestiture will be executed through a third-party sale or capital markets transaction, consistent with the European Commission's divestiture order.To date, we have been able to make swift progress. GRAIL's Form 10 has been confidentially filed with the SEC. Advisers are actively moving the process forward on both sale and capital market path. The special committee of the Board that we established in Q3 continues to help ensure this process move forward efficiently. I'm encouraged by the momentum we've entered 2024 with, and I'm committed to seeing our initiative through.For now, I will ask Joydeep to share more detail on our results for 2023 and our outlook for 2024."", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Thank you, Jacob. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2024. I'll be discussing non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website.In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.12 billion was up 4% year-over-year, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Consolidated revenue was flat from the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $22 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $152 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations, driven by higher revenue and gross margin and lower operating expense for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 55.4% for the quarter and 41.8% for full year 2023 compared to 29.3% in Q4 2022 and 26% for full year 2022.Although both periods reflect the impact of R&D capitalization requirements, the impact to our effective tax rate in 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings. In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate for both years include a meaningful impact from the consolidation of GRAIL's losses. Absent the impact of GRAIL, our full year 2023 core tax rate was in the mid-20s. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million.Moving to segment results. Core Illumina fourth quarter revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, and included an anticipated reduction of approximately 5 percentage points from 2 primary categories: one, the decrease in COVID surveillance and the effect of sanctions in Russia that together represented approximately 3 percentage points and two, the year-over-year reduction in China revenue that represented approximately 2 percentage points. Despite these impacts, core Illumina revenue exceeded expectations due to stronger-than-projected NovaSeq X placements, an uptake in X consumables with strong early demand for the 25B flow cell that launched in Q4. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $687 million was flat year-over-year.Stronger-than-expected NovaSeq X consumables purchases were largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions as customers continue to adopt the NovaSeq X. Total sequencing consumables revenue was also impacted by COVID, Russia and China factors that I previously noted as well as the continued impact of macroeconomic conditions on customers' purchasing behavior. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $4 million in total revenue in Q4 2023 compared to $20 million in Q4 2022.Turning to sequencing activity. Total activity on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew 46% year-over-year in the quarter following the 29% year-over-year growth we reported in Q3. Sequentially, Q4 sequencing activity grew 13% from Q3. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina of $161 million grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, driven primarily by NovaSeq X, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments. Growth in high-throughput instruments was partially offset by the expected decline in mid- and low-throughput shipments due to capital purchase and cash flow constraints that continue to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors as well as local competition in China.For NovaSeq X, we exited Q4 with 390 orders since launch. Our shipments of 79 NovaSeq X instruments in Q4 brought our total installed base to 352 instruments. While we expect most of our NovaSeq 6000 customers to transition to the NovaSeq X over time, we are still very early in this transition. As of the end of 2023, our net installed base for NovaSeq 6000 was approximately 1,770 instruments, which reflects approximately 110 instruments that have been deactivated between 2017 and 2023. The majority of these were in 2023 due to customer transitions to NovaSeq X. We expect this to increase in 2024 as customers continue to ramp up utilization of NovaSeq X.Additionally, going forward, we will be reporting our annual instrument installed base figures on a net basis, which accounts for instruments that have been decommissioned or inactivated since launch. The information included on this slide includes additional details to help you with your modeling. We will be posting this presentation to our Investor Relations website following our prepared remarks.Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $152 million was up 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base.Moving to the rest of core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 64.7% for the quarter decreased 260 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the mix of lower-margin strategic partnership revenue, lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical with a new platform introduction, and increased field services and installation costs partially offset by lower freight costs. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $507 million were down $21 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued expense reduction initiatives and lower performance-based stock compensation expense year-over-year. As a result of these factors and higher revenue, core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 18.5% in Q4 2023 compared to 17.8% in Q4 2022.Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $30 million for the quarter grew 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $167 million and increased $1 million year-over-year.Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $224 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million, and free cash flow was $173 million. We did not repurchase any common stock. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.05 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.Moving now to 2024 guidance. As Illumina continues to move as quickly as possible to resolve GRAIL, given the uncertainty around the specific timing and impact of the GRAIL divestment, the company is focusing its 2024 financial outlook on core Illumina. Our guidance does not assume any impact for the potential divestment of GRAIL in 2024. Upon the completion of the divestment, we will provide non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2024.As Jacob mentioned, our outlook assumes the current challenging macroeconomic environment persists in 2024, and tighter funding and budget pressures continue to impact our customers' purchasing decisions. We expect full year 2024 core revenue to be approximately flat from 2023, reflecting the following offsetting factors. We expect core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue to decline in the high teens year-over-year driven primarily by a decrease in NovaSeq X instrument placements. The reduction reflects the expected transition in our adoption curve to early majority customers from early adopters and the lower backlog entering 2024 compared to 2023. We also expect capital and cash flow constraints to continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements in 2024.We expect core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to grow in the low single digits year-over-year, driven primarily by modest growth in high-throughput consumables, as increased NovaSeq X consumables purchases and sequencing volume outpaced the expected decline in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions.Moving to annual pull-through. Going forward, we will be calculating and providing pull-through figures based on the instruments' net installed base. As I mentioned previously, supplemental information is included in our earnings presentation to help with modeling, which will be posted to our Investor Relations website following our prepared remarks. Importantly, this does not change reported revenue in any way. We expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 of approximately $700,000 to $800,000 per system in 2024, as customers continue to transition sequencing volume to NovaSeq X.We expect annual pull-through for NextSeq 1000, 2000 in the range of $80,000 to $130,000 per system in 2024, which primarily reflects the impact of customers transitioning to X lead chemistry as it becomes available on NextSeq 1000, 2000. We expect annual pull-through for MiSeq in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. We expect the remainder of our pull-through ranges to be in line with historical guidance.We expect core Illumina total sequencing revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation.We expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our operating margin expectations reflect the benefit of our continued gross margin improvement and expense reduction initiatives offset by normalization of our performance-based compensation as well as the impacts of inflation and market-based merit increases.For the first quarter of 2024, we expect core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 3.5% to 4.5%, driven predominantly by the following factors. We expect lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments year-over-year given that we are entering 2024 with a more modest backlog compared to the significant preorder book we entered 2023 following the launch of NovaSeq X. We expect the increase in NovaSeq X consumables purchases year-over-year to be largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions consistent with the trend we saw in Q4. We expect an increase in sequencing service and other revenue year-over-year driven by strategic partnership initiatives and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base.For the first quarter, we expect core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%. Lastly, for the first quarter, we expect core Illumina non-GAAP net other expense of approximately $12 million with the year-over-year increase driven primarily by lower interest income on our lower cash balance following the repayment of our convertible notes in mid-2023.I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you."", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Thanks, Joydeep. Before we close and move to Q&A, I want to discuss what I believe success looks like, both this year and the years ahead. Illumina has the opportunity to truly drive the next-generation sequencing ecosystem forward. We will deepen our relationships with our customers, and seek out greater ways to collaborate and partner with them to drive greater adoption of NGS.Our goal is to make our customers the heroes in their labs and to support them as they expand their work in genomics and multiomics. In turn, this will help capitalize our market-leading innovation and continue to differentiate Illumina and maintain our industry-leading position across research and clinical markets. We will also continue to drive innovation that is focused on our customers' priorities. This includes evolving our sequencing platform and delivering greater sample-to-answer solutions. There is an opportunity to further integrate customers' workflow to build our share of wallet as we create greater value for our customers. Our comprehensive strategy work is well underway, and we will share more with you later this year. I'm excited to be part of Illumina's leadership team that is driving our unmatched core business forward. Thank you for joining.I'll now invite the operator to open the line for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Douglas Schenkel with Wolfe Research.', 'Douglas Anthony Schenkel', ""I want to ask just about the 25B chip release and what you're seeing in the field entering the early part of the year. As you know, 25B reduces the cost per genome to about $200, but it also requires customers to have enough samples to run to fully use up the flow cells. So what are -- what have you seen in the first few months of availability? What's spending on X consumables? How did that trend relative to Q3? And are you seeing signs in the field that sample access is not a problem as you see folks move to the 25B?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Thanks, Doug. And that was nice one question there. So let me start by saying that we've been very pleased with the pickup of the 25B since the launch in late November. In fact, it's kind of performed over our expectations and have been very well received by the customers. So we continue to expect that this will continue to really drive X performance, but also, of course, it's completely now unleashed the full performance of the instrument, and thereby, we also expect that the 25B -- the availability of the 25B will have more customers to jump on to the X wagon here. I think we are seeing customers being able to load it. Of course, many of them are still doing validation work, but we are seeing that they have big enough projects to load the flow cells."", 'Joydeep Goswami', 'Yes. And just maybe one quick add, right? About 40% of our X customers so far have adopted the 25B.', 'Jacob Thaysen', 'Correct.', 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.', 'Puneet Souda', ""So maybe just following up on that point. I mean sort of help us just understand how do you get to the low single-digit growth rate this year. There's obviously 25B. There's reductions that are happening in -- from just the X installs. Cost per database is lower. China continues to be challenging, and then the market backdrop is challenging too. So just maybe talk to us a little bit about sort of how do you continue to have confidence in the sort of the low single-digit sequencing consumable growth rate?And I would really appreciate if you could provide us some context around and details around GRAIL as well. What's the progress there? Any level of interest that you're finding? And what are you contemplating for spend on GRAIL this year?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""All right. Thanks for that, Puneet. And let me start by the latter part of this question about GRAIL, and then I'll have Joydeep chime in on our expectations here on consumables growth. But as I mentioned, we are very pleased with the announcement that we made here in December that we are now divesting GRAIL for sure, and I'm actually very pleased with the progress so far. We have our advisers really moving ahead and now in connection and in conversations with [the relevant] parties.We are continuing to run a dual track, of course, via a capital market initiative or it can be a transaction. And so we still expect to be on track with the time line. We were previously talking about that we would have -- we will have all the terms finalized by end of Q2. So we are -- at this point, we are not talking about -- since we are expecting to finish up with GRAIL this year, we're not having any guidance on the expenditure for GRAIL this year."", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Yes. And to address your question about the low single digits, consumables growth, Puneet, so let me start by saying we were very encouraged by the uptake of the 25B and 10B flow cells that we saw in the fourth quarter. We're also very pleased to see the elasticity, the growth in underlying sequencing activity being driven by X customers, right? So both of those are good. We saw that uptick on sequencing activity now for the second quarter in a row. So again, it's broad-based. It's both research and clinical customers. And it's quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth.So what's offsetting expected growth in X consumables, as you rightly pointed out, is the expected price transition as customers move from the NovaSeq 6000 to the X. This is very similar to the price transition that you saw when you were moving from HiSeq to 6000 and then, of course, some of the expected again, reduction in 6000 consumables as customers switch from one platform to the other, right? So those -- that is the really big piece on the -- what's leading to the lower -- or the low single-digit growth rate in consumables in 2024."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""I had a two-part question on this GRAIL. I know it was a confidential S-1. When will that be made public? And the reason I ask is GRAIL's operating losses were $700 million last year. It's really hard to foresee a capital market transaction with those kind of spend levels, so I would be very curious to see what the S-1 assumptions are on GRAIL. And on consumable pull-through, $700,000 to $800,000 on NovaSeq 6000, Joydeep, is there like a cadence perhaps, Q1, we're starting at the low end? And is the assumption we exit Q4 at the high end of that range?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes. So let's start with the GRAIL question. And obviously, we'd like to provide as much information to all of you as possible. Right now, as you say, the filing is confidential, and I don't think it will be public available before very late in Q1, maybe dripping into Q2 here. So I think that's where we are at this. But as soon as it's available, we'll make sure you know."", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""And then, Vijay, I want to be sure. You're asking about NextSeq 6000 -- sorry, NovaSeq 6000 pull-through numbers and how they modulate through the year?"", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', 'Correct, Joydeep. Is there an assumption we start at the low end and exit the year at the high end or above the high end of that range?', 'Joydeep Goswami', ""No, there isn't. I think, again, pull-through, I will reemphasize, is a calculated number, so it's more of the total amount of consumables sold in any quarter divided by the number of now the active installed base in the quarter, right? So -- and we don't have an assumption in terms of quarterly spread on that."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel.', 'Daniel Anthony Arias', ""Jacob or Joydeep, on the 6000 to X transition and just sort of thinking about the clinical side of things, a big part of that bucket are these commercial labs that are watching their own margins pretty tightly and trying to find ways to be just more efficient. So are you sensing that maybe you could see X adoption faster than in maybe in a normal environment in order for those folks to take advantage of the cost savings? It seems like they're incentivized to do that, but I also know that the clinical wheel spins slowly. So I'm just not sure whether that's a factor for them."", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes. Of course, it's a relevant hypothesis to come in with. What we have seen is that most of our clinical customers are using the opportunity with the lower cost of X to actually expand the depth of sequencing, providing bigger panels and so on. So what we're seeing is that most of the current panels continue to run on the NovaSeq 6000 and thereby continue to also drive volume there.And then they are, right now, validating many of the new assays or the new assays that might not have been possible in the 6000 due to the cost and so on to be on the X. So we're quite encouraged about that. We've also seen several of our specialty labs customer now order tens of NovaSeq X. So I'm encouraged that we will see a lot of volume here going forward on this."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Subha Nambi with Guggenheim Securities.', 'Subhalaxmi T. Nambi', ""You spent about $1 billion on R&D in 2022 relative to 2019. The revenue has grown at 6% CAGR. However, R&D has grown 12% CAGR. Why can't you reduce R&D spend in dollar terms from current levels over the next 1 or 2 years? Can you outline where the spend is allocating?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes, thank you. You're right that we continue to believe that there's a lot of innovation that is required, thereby investment into R&D in order to drive the whole NGS ecosystem forward. We -- as I said, one of the things -- what I said previously is one of the things that I was really excited about is the pipeline of innovation that we have in running right now and thereby, also there will be a lot of innovation coming out from Illumina over the next period of time here. And we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of the whole opportunities here in NGS but even also in multiomics, and thereby, we continue to make investment into that. You're also right that there has been an increase in R&D, and we're certainly looking to change that trajectory over time. We still believe that a high level of investment is required, but you will see here over the next years that the percentage spend in R&D versus revenue will start to come down."", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Just to add, Subha, I think we have made reductions in R&D over the last year. It's been very strategic in terms of specific aspects of the portfolio that we had considered as longer -- much longer time of payoffs or more risky. And we have also -- our overall R&D includes spend in certain areas like medical affairs, et cetera, that we were doing to support customers. And as they have matured, right, we have been able to pull back on investment there without affecting innovation."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take a question from Mason Carrico with Stephens."", 'Mason Owen Carrico', ""So for high-throughput customers who have already purchased an X, could you talk about the conversations you're having around the potential fleet expansions? I mean what portion of those opportunities, whether it's orders or shipments, have already come through and how many remain an opportunity this year?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes. I think, I mean, we certainly see a lot of our high-end customers, the high-volume customers that started buying 1 or 2 NovaSeq X, is starting to consider purchasing more instruments. So they're using the first few X to validate assays on. And then they want to expand into -- use the additional Xs to actually run in production. But very few customers have still gone into production mode, and thereby, there is a real big opportunity in front of us.I think that less than half of our high-volume customers have purchased an X so far, so I think there's still a lot of opportunities there. But as also mentioned, some of the high-volume customers that have purchased 1 or 2 have now put orders in for 10 instruments. So I think we're still in the very early stages, and there should be a lot of opportunities here, both in '24 and '25, to drive more placements."", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Yes. I'd just add, we weren't expecting to see that before the launch of the 25B flow cell, right? So really, you're in very early innings there, and we do expect to see those fleet expansions come in, in this year."", 'Operator', 'And we have a question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.', 'David Michael Westenberg', ""I'm actually going to hit on the -- some of the competition coming in. A couple of different things we saw at AGBT, for example, a combination of spatial and sequencing on one platform. How do you see that stacking competitively? Would you pursue a strategy like that? And then on Ultima, the $100 genome, some of the specs look significantly better than it did a couple of years ago. How do you feel stacked up against the $100 price with some of your key bells and whistles?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes. Thanks, Dave. And of course, we're tracking, of course, everything that is happening out in the market and we take our competition very seriously. But I think you've also heard me on the multiomics place. I think you've heard me speak multiple times about multiomics. So we have an intention also to be in that space. I think we were now talking about moving forward as a starting point with proteomics here with our relationships with SomaLogic.But I think you can see that -- actually, we believe there is many more modalities that can be available on the instruments. So I think the -- where we -- where Illumina is doing it, that we will go out and provide that insight when we're ready to put something in the market and speak less about it when it's more in the future.Secondly, we feel with the NovaSeq X where we come out with a very attractive price point for a lot of different applications and not only a very few ones. So I think we feel that we have a very attractive solution. But I also remind you that it's not only the cost per sequencing that -- anymore that is relevant, but also you need to look at the whole cost of the whole workflow, how many manual steps you have, how much waste you are -- is instrument spending and so on. So I think if you dig into the details, you will actually realize that Illumina has a very attractive and very differentiated platform."", 'Operator', ""We'll take a question from Conor McNamara with RBC."", 'Conor Noel McNamara', ""Just a financial question on margins. You're guiding to 18% in Q1 and 20% for the whole year. So how do we think about the cadence of the margin progression? And I guess same on tax rate. Just you talked about a mid-20s for the core Illumina tax rate. How should we think about that in '24?"", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Yes. So the tax rate, again, is something that should be -- you should expect to be relatively constant as you go into -- and again, for core Illumina into 2024. And this is, again, core Illumina, right? We are not giving guidance this year yet on the consolidated number.In terms of the operating margin cadence, again, that is -- typically, that does go up as the gross margins tend to go up as we move into greater volume and -- through the year. In terms of operating margin, you will see a decrease in -- potentially in Q2 as the merit and the other inflation-related aspects come into play. But then you will see after that, a quarter-on-quarter increase as we move into the rest of the year.And then, of course, I think on the -- sorry, just one other thing, right? I know there's been some movement in terms of the R&D capitalization piece, but that is something we're monitoring very carefully. It is past the House, but it still needs to get through the Senate and the President signing. If we get that, you can expect a further improvement in the tax rate, right? But we are not building that into our assumptions at this point."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank.', 'Sung Ji Nam', ""Just on the MRD assay under development with Janssen, was wondering if you might be able to comment whether that's a tumor-informed or a tumor-naive approach or something different altogether and whether that might have -- whether there might be potential for that to be developed into a IBD assay in the future for clinical applications?"", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. So again, to remind everyone, the approach that Illumina has is quite unique. It's a whole genome-based MRD assay. It is initially a tumor-informed assay, but it does have the potential with more data and behind it to, at some point, move into a tumor naive, right?In terms of being capable of being IBD, of course, as you know, we have invested very heavily in platforms and technologies and infrastructure that allow us to move assays to be IBD when the time is right, right? So right now, the agreement we have with pharma has been mainly to explore this in various forms. But we can go move into IBD when the time is right."", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Let me also add that we have no intention of providing that through a CLIA lab -- commercial CLIA lab. We do have our CLIA lab that, of course, is running very few samples, but we're not going out and commercialize it through our CLIA lab. In fact, we're very interested to work with customers and partners to continue to develop this."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi."", 'Patrick Bernard Donnelly', ""Joydeep, maybe a quick one for you and the follow-up would be probably more for Jacob. But just on the gross margin piece, can you talk about a 4Q step down a little bit, came in a little light of where we were. Can you just talk about anything that impacted that in 4Q, the right way to think about the progression there throughout '24?And then on the gross margin kind of pricing initiatives, Jacob, how are you thinking about just the price side? Again, I know someone mentioned AGBT. Competitors are making noise, kind of saying they're seeing discounting in the market, particularly on kind of the mid-throughput side. So just curious, as you've taken a look here, what you're thinking about on the pricing side."", 'Joydeep Goswami', 'Yes. So Patrick, in terms of sequential decrease in fourth quarter on gross margin, there are several factors there, right? One, revenue was lower, so that has an impact, obviously, in terms of just absorption of fixed costs. We also did have a higher-than-expected X contribution. And that, coupled with more of the partnership revenue, which tends to be lower margin driven, all affected our gross margin numbers. And then lastly, I will say there was a mix shift from 6000 consumables to X consumables, and that also had an impact in our overall gross margin number for Q4. I will say, and I think it leads into your question to Jacob, we have made a lot of progress in 2023 in terms of COGS productivity and we started seeing the benefits of that as we rolled out of 2023 and into 2024 as well and beyond.', 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes. If I -- when -- coming into the company here, Patrick, and looking into pricing and how we are thinking about pricing going forward, first, I will say that Illumina is presenting a premium product and thereby, I think also our customers are seeing that we can command a premium pricing in the industry. But I think more importantly is that only talking about cost per gigabase is probably too simplistic for most of our customers. They are more interested in the cost for the whole for sample to insight, for the whole workflows. And that is, of course, including sample prep automation but probably even more importantly, informatics, which is also a key cost driver for our customers.So really with the DRAGEN platform and what we have in our comprehensive informatics offering, we actually can provide the customer be a very cost-attractive solution. So therefore, the thing about just talking cost per gigabase is kind of the -- maybe the old way of looking at it and the future way we look at a little more comprehensive.So I feel really good about that, where we are. And that said, we will now with -- in the mid-throughput with the XLEAP-SBS chemistry be available, we are coming out with a more attractive pricing, quality and more capacity on our 1000 and 2000 instruments. So I'm really excited about that and again, driving elasticity based on that new price point. So you will see us really move the [knots] on many more elements on just one pricing element."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Eve Burstein with Bernstein Research.', 'Eve Burstein', ""I had a -- wanted to ask about NextSeq placement. So there, you ended the year with 885 placements, and that's comfortably above where you were pre-pandemic, but it's also below where you've been for the last 2 years. So how much of this do you attribute to just changing needs, obviously, post-pandemic? How much do you attribute to the capital purchase and cash flow constraints that you talked about? And how much do you attribute to competitive dynamics, which you also talked about? And then how should we think about what normalized demand here looks like going forward?"", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Yes. So I think the major factors I would put 2, maybe 3, right? And then there's a sub factor. So the major factors, as you rightly pointed out, coming out of COVID in '21 and '22, we had a real uptick in the amount of mid-throughput instruments and low-throughput instrument sales, right? And that has normalized a little bit as the COVID threat thankfully has reduced. We also, at the same time, did see in 2023 some of the macroeconomic conditions that led to more conservatism at our customers and more conservatism in the purchases on capital come through.The third factor in mid-throughput especially was also China, right? So if you're looking at an overall number, we did get impacted in China for competition and for macroeconomic reasons as we have repeatedly stated in our 2023 earnings calls. As far as competition goes, I mean, clearly, that was a factor in China, but that does not seem to be a huge factor in the rest of the world, right? And we did see our -- we track our competitive win rates fairly closely, and we did see that stabilize in Q3 and in Q4."", 'Operator', 'And moving on to Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.', 'Daniel Gregory Brennan', 'On the X pull-through, we were coming up around $1 million in the fourth quarter and some quick math. We arrived at something like maybe $850,000 in 2024. So any comment on those numbers that they seem reasonable? And if so, could you just speak to like what would drive the assumption for that kind of sequential step down?', 'Jacob Thaysen', ""So thanks, Dan. And I think you've done more math on that than we have at this point since it's still way too early in -- way early innings here to start to look at pull-through from the X. So we haven't really done that math as of yet, and we will provide that math when we think we are more in a stable situation where it makes sense. Any other comments on that, Joydeep?"", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""No. I think I'll reiterate, look, it is early. I think Jacob stated earlier that many customers are just going through validation, especially on the 25B. So I will disagree with him that we haven't done the math, but the math is not relevant, and we don't want to confuse you. When this stabilizes, right, we will absolutely come out with a number, but so far, what we have seen has been encouraging to us."", 'Operator', 'And we have a question from Dan Leonard with UBS.', 'Daniel Louis Leonard', ""Jacob, I'm curious if you could elaborate further on the health of your diagnostics markets following your customer listening tour. And with looming FDA regulation of LDTs, how does that impact demand for your products or not?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes. No, I think that's a good question, something also I really was eager to understand better coming into Illumina. As you know, I have a background in IBD, and I have a lot of passion for cancer diagnostic but really fighting cancers and I think how we think about it, of course, that we serve a lot of clinical customers out there that is using the Illumina ecosystem and build companies on top of that, primarily into the LDT space. And then we have our own offerings in other LDT but in all places also, IBD, on -- especially the TSO 500 and the NIPT and other places where -- and if you look into our TSO 500 business, it's been growing really fast over the last period of time. And it's more than $100 million now, and we expect to have a high double-digit growth also into this year, and we don't see any end to that right now.So I'm really bullish around where we can bring that. And we are, of course, looking into a strategic review right now on how does that fit into the overall core business strategy. But clearly, we would also like to play in that space going forward.There was another -- was there a second part of that question?"", 'Joydeep Goswami', 'Regulation impact?', 'Jacob Thaysen', ""Yes. Okay. So I think the second part was the impact of the regulation. I mean, of course, we're monitoring that very, very deeply right now. And there's, of course, again, a conversation with our customers and we are helping some customers make sure they are ready for that. Our -- the larger customers can, of course, go through a single-site PMA, which helps them.But there's also a change that's maybe in the leveling of the different -- so some of the Class III products are considered being brought down to Class II products right now. It's still kind of on the table for consideration. But if that happens, that will certainly also reduce the requirements for getting through clinical trials and so on. So I think there's still a lot of moving elements. But what I can tell you is that, I think, Illumina is very well positioned to support the markets going forward, almost independent on where FDA is landing on this one."", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""I'd just add, Jacob, that we are about the only company that has, even in our REO products, ISO 13485 classification on all our instruments and most of our consumables, and we have, obviously, the path to IBD should our customers want it, right? So we're well positioned to serve whichever direction they want to go in."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Kyle Mikson with Canaccord.', 'Kyle Alexander Mikson', ""Just following guidance. So it seems like you probably had the opportunity to kind of establish an outlook that was softer than what you said in November. Could have set a low bar. You kept the range, though. Risks clearly remain. How much like visibility or comments do you have? And how much conservatism are you kind of baking in compared to prior years? And you listed some of -- what are the most material swing factors and kind of risks that we should consider in 1Q and then first half versus second half.And if I could just ask one for you, Joydeep, on 6000 pull-through. The $700,000, $800,000 seems like possibly aggressive compared to how HiSeq kind of declined in its years, post the 2000 launch. So just kind of walk through what you're thinking about in terms of the decline, I guess, or deterioration in 6000 pull-through?"", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Let me address the 6000 piece first. It's maybe an easier one, right? So remember when HiSeq was -- well, NovaSeq 6000 was introduced, we didn't have as many clinical customers, right? So now we have clinical -- about 50% of our cons revenue is coming from clinical customers who have these validated assays, right, where you're not going to change platforms in the short term. So the overall reduction in pull-through will be more mitigated compared to what you saw with HiSeq.Jacob, do you want to comment on the overall guidance or you want to me to?"", 'Jacob Thaysen', 'No, you can continue.', 'Joydeep Goswami', ""So I think, overall, look, we have repeatedly said, right, we see this as a prudent approach to the overall forecast, right? And while there have been some signs in some markets that the macroeconomic conditions might be turning, we have not assumed this in our forecast. And the only place we have been pessimistic and of course, has been in China, right, where the recent news also seems to corroborate that piece.As far as the puts and takes, look, it's a lot about adoption of the X, right? So we're spending an inordinate amount of time making sure that our X customers can transition quickly, can adopt and get on with their assays as quickly as possible. And we will continue to do that. And of course, if the markets pick up, we are very well positioned then to benefit from any of the upsides. On the flip side, it's further macroeconomic headwinds that further reduce our customers' ability to bring on the X or the spend on consumables will affect us as well.Jacob, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add."", 'Jacob Thaysen', ""I think we're good."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.', 'Rachel Marie Vatnsdal Olson', ""I just want to follow up to your answer on Patrick's question earlier. You mentioned that the gross margin line in 4Q was lighter due to that consumables mix shift from 6000 to the X. So can you just walk us through that dynamic a little bit more? Is this just a function of the Xs ramping, so there's less volume leverage at this point? Or is there something where X consumables are structurally lower margin? And then how should we think about that consumables mix impacting gross margin throughout '24 as well?"", 'Joydeep Goswami', ""Yes. So first, easy part is, no, we have said right all through, right, that we had designed the X and X consumables that, at scale, right, they would -- we would expect the margins to be comparable to X consumables at scale. What you're seeing is, of course, early on in the adoption, you're going to see the consumables margins to be lower. We haven't fully scaled up. And as we move through '24, you will see that more or less normalized.Now as you go into '24, overall gross margins will be -- have several factors, right? So one, we will have a little bit of a benefit from this lower placement of instruments. As you -- we've said, right, that we do expect that to decline a little bit. More consumables, that will lead to an increase in gross margin. We also will benefit from some uptick in terms of all the actions we have taken to improve COGS productivity. So those are the 2 largest things that will serve to improve our gross margins as we get to 2024."", 'Operator', 'And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Salli Schwartz.', 'Sallilyn Schwartz', 'Thank you for joining us today.

Core FFO results for the fourth quarter were ahead of our expectations. Higher non-same-store NOI performance and lower interest expense drove the outperformance. As expected, during the fourth quarter, a combination of higher new supply and a seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic increasingly weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter. Encouragingly, we did see some of this pressure moderate in January with blended pricing improving 130 basis points from the fourth quarter performance led by improvement in new lease pricing, stable employment conditions, continued positive migration trends, a higher propensity of new households to rent apartments and continued low resident turnover are all combining to support steady demand for apartment housing. We continue to believe that late this year, new lease pricing performance will improve, and we will begin to capture recovery in that component of our revenue performance. In addition, with the approach of surrounding higher new supply deliveries likely to moderate later this year, we continue to believe the conditions are coming together for overall pricing recovery to begin late this year and into 2025. As you may have seen, last week, MAA crossed a significant milestone marking the 30-year anniversary since our IPO. Over the past 30 years, MAA has delivered an annual compounded investment return to shareholders of 12.6%, with about half of that return comprised of the cash dividends paid. Through numerous new supply cycles and various stresses associated with the broader economy, MAA has never suspended or reduced our quarterly dividend over the past 30 years, which of course, is a key component of delivering superior long-term investment returns to REIT shareholders. Today, I'm more positive about our outlook than I was at this time last year. Today, as compared to a year ago, we have more clarity about the outlook for interest rates with downward movement likely later in the year. Worries associated with material economic slowdown or recession are dissipating, inflation pressures on operating expenses are declining. The demand for apartment housing and absorption remains steady and with clearly declining permits and new construction starts, we have increasing visibility that competing new supply is poised to moderate with a 30-year track record of focus on high-growth markets, successfully working through several economic cycles, an experienced team and proven operating platform, a strong balance sheet and long-term shareholder performance among the top tier of all REITs, we're confident about our ability to execute on the growing opportunities in the coming year and beyond. Before turning the call over to Brad, I do want to take them on and just say a big thank you to Al Campbell, who will be officially retiring effective March 31. Al has been with our team for the past 26 years and has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. Al has been instrumental in the growth of our company, transitioning us to the investment-grade debt capital markets and has built a strong finance, accounting, tax and internal audit platform for MAA. Al leads our company and finance operation in strong hands with Clay and his team, and we're all grateful for Al's service and tremendous accomplishments. So thank you, Al, for all you've done for MAA. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad."", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned in our earnings release, we successfully closed on 2 compelling acquisitions during the fourth quarter at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. Both properties fit the profile of the type of properties we expect to continue to emerge throughout 2024. Properties in their initial lease-up with sellers focused on certainty of execution with the need to transact prior to a definitive deadline. Our relationships with the sellers and our ability to move quickly and execute on the transactions utilizing the available capacity on our line of credit without a financing contingency were key components of MAA being chosen as the buyer for these properties. In May, Central Avenue, a 323 unit mid-rise property in the Midtown area of Phoenix, and MAA Optimist Park, a 352 unit mid-rise property in the Optimist Park area of Charlotte are expected to deliver initial stabilized NOI yields of 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively. We expect both properties to achieve further yield and margin expansion as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management, marketing and lead generation practices as well as our technology platform. Additionally, we expect to achieve operational synergies by combining certain functions with other area MAA properties as part of our new property podding initiative. Due to continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains tepid, down 50% year-over-year and 16% from the third quarter's pace. We continue to believe that transaction volumes will pick up later in 2024, providing visibility into cap rates and market values. For deals we tracked in the fourth quarter, we saw cap rates move up by roughly 35 basis points from the third quarter. Our transaction team is very active in evaluating additional acquisition opportunities across our footprint with our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of more compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year. Our forecast for the year includes $400 million of new acquisitions likely in lease-up and therefore, dilutive until stabilization is reached. Despite pressure from elevated new supply, our 2 stabilized new developments as well as our development projects, currently leasing continue to deliver good performance, producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted in our original pro formas, creating additional long-term value. New lease rates are facing more pressure at the moment, but these properties have captured asking rents on average approximately 20% above our original expectations. Our forward developments that are currently leasing are estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to permitting and approval delays as well as an expectation that construction costs are likely to come down, we have pushed the 3 projects that we plan to start in 2023 into 2024. We now expect to start between 3 to 4 projects this year with 2 starts in the first half of the year and 2 starts late in the year. Encouragingly, we have seen some recent success in getting our construction costs down on new projects that we're currently repricing. As we have seen a meaningful decline in construction starts in our region, we're hopeful to see continued decline in construction costs as we progress through the year. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today, we own or control 13 well-located sites, representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3,700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined. Any project we start this year, we'll deliver first units in 2026, aligning with the likely stronger leasing environment supported by significantly lower supply. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this constrained liquidity environment, it's possible we could add additional development opportunities to our future pipeline. The team has our portfolio in good position. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets outperforming. As we ramp up activities in 2024, we're excited about the coming year. Beyond the new external growth opportunities just covered, and as Tim will outline further, we continue to see solid demand and steady absorption of the new supply delivering across our markets and remain convinced that pricing trends will begin to improve late this year and into 2025. In addition, we continue to make progress on several new initiatives aimed at further enhancing our leasing platform to further position us to outperform local market leasing metrics during the supply cycle. Before I turn the call over to Tim, to all of our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices, I want to say thank you for coming to work every day, focused on improving our business, serving our residents and exceeding the expectations of those that depend on us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store NOI growth for the quarter was right in line with our expectations with slightly lower operating expenses offsetting slightly lower blended lease-over-lease pricing growth. Expanding on Eric's earlier comment on new lease pricing, developers looking to gain occupancy ahead of the holiday season and the end of the year did put further pressure on new lease pricing, particularly in November and December. However, because traffic tends to decline in the fourth quarter, again, particularly in November and December, we intentionally repriced only 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter and only about 9% in November and December. This resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of minus 1.6% for the quarter, comprised of new lease rates declining 7% and renewal rates increasing 4.8%. Average physical occupancy was 95.5% and collections remained strong, with delinquency representing less than 0.5% of bill grants. These key components drove the resulting revenue growth of 2.1%. From a market perspective, in the fourth quarter, many of our mid-tier metros performed well. Being invested in a broad number of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points is a key part of our strategy to capture growth throughout the cycle. Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are examples of markets that led the portfolio and lease-over-lease pricing performance, the Washington, D.C. metro area, Houston and to a lesser extent, Dallas Fort Worth for larger metros that held up well. Austin and Jacksonville are 2 markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the level of supply being delivered into those markets. Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we completed nearly 1,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our full year total to just under 6,900 units. We completed over 21,000 smart home upgrades in 2023 and now have over 93,000 units with this technology and we expect to complete the remaining few properties in 2024. For our repositioning program, we have 5 active projects that are in the repricing phase with expected yields in the 8% range. We have targeted -- an additional 6 projects began in 2024 with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025. Now looking forward to 2024, we're encouraged by the relative pricing trends we are seeing thus far. As noted by Eric, blended pricing in January, it was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.2%, an 80 basis point improvement for the fourth quarter and notably a 150 basis point improvement from December and renewal pricing of 5.1%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, while maintaining stable occupancy of 95.4%. Similarly, renewal increases achieved thus far in February and March average around 5%. As noted, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets. While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in the second quarter of 2022. Based on typical delivery timelines, this suggests peak deliveries likely in the middle of this year with some positive impact of pricing power soon thereafter. While increasing supply is impactful, strength of demand is more indicative of the pricing power in a particular market. Job growth is expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but growth is still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt markets. Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerates the key demand factor of household formation. Separately, the cost gap between owning and renting gapped out considerably in the back half of 2023 even before considering the impact of higher mortgage rates. Move-out-to-buy-a-home dropped 20% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect a continued low number of move-outs due to home buying to contribute to low turnover overall in 2024. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay."", 'Clay Holder', 'Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.32 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance and contributed core FFO for the full year of $9.17 per share, representing an approximate 8% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily driven by favorable interest and the performance of our recent acquisitions and lease-up during the quarter. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly below our expectations for the quarter as effective rent growth was impacted by lower new lease pricing that Tim mentioned. Same-store operating expenses were slightly favorable to our fourth quarter guidance primarily from lower-than-expected personnel costs and property taxes. During the quarter, we invested a total of $20.7 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart brand installation programs, producing solid returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded $48 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $647 million pipeline leaving nearly $256 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start to 3 to 4 projects over the course of 2024, which would keep our development pipeline at a level consistent with where we ended 2023, in which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the year with nearly $792 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains low with debt to EBITDA at 3.6x. And at year-end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average of 6.8 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. Shortly after year-end, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2024 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.68 to $9.08 or $8.88 at the midpoint. The projected 2024 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.9% results from rental pricing earn-in of 0.5% combined with blended rental pricing expectation of 1% for the year. We expect blended rental pricing as to be comprised of lower new lease pricing impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels. Effective rent growth for the year is projected to be approximately 0.9% at the midpoint of our range. We expect occupancy to average between 95.4% and 96% for the year and other revenue items, primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow in line with effective rent. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 4.85% for the year with real estate taxes and insurance producing most of the growth pressure. Combined, these 2 items are expected to grow almost 6% for 2024 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow just over 4%. These expense projections, combined with the revenue growth of 0.9% results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.3% at the midpoint. We have a recently completed development community in lease-up, along with an additional 3 development communities actively leasing. As these 4 communities are not fully leased up and stabilized and given the interest carry associated with these projects, we anticipate our development pipeline being diluted to core FFO by about $0.05 in 2024 and turning accretive to core FFO on later stabilization. We are expecting continued external growth in 2024 both through acquisitions and development opportunities. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized and a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, which we expect dispositions of approximately $100 million, with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow. This external growth is expected to be slightly dilutive to core FFO in 2024 and then again, turning to accretive to core FFO after stabilizing. We project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses and G&A expenses to be $132.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.9% increase over 2023 results. We expect to refinance $400 million of bonds maturing in June 2024. These bonds currently have a rate of 4% and we forecast to refinance north of 5%. This expected refinance, coupled with the recently completed refinancing activities mentioned previously, results of $0.04 of dilution to core FFO as compared to prior year. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Carey, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.', 'Joshua Dennerlein', ""I appreciate all the color you provided on guidance. My first question would just be on the same-store revenue growth outlook. Can you provide us any more details on what would get you to the high and low end of guidance? And I guess, I'm really curious about what you would assume for the blended rate growth at the higher low end."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""This is Tim. So I think as far as the high end of the low end, I think we feel pretty comfortable with the renewal rates and they've been steady for the last few months. What we're seeing, as I noted, the next few months as being in that 5% range. I think that the new lease rates are what could certainly determine whether we get more to the high and low end, which is going to be a function of the demand side. We expect to see steady job growth, steady demand and migration, all those factors. So that's a little bit better. I think it obviously pushes new lease rates higher and then the opposite is true. But if you think about our full year guide, it's built on new lease rates for the year, and this will be seasonal, starting a little bit lower in Q1, accelerating to Q2 and Q3 and then declining a little bit in Q4, but somewhere in the negative 3%, 3.25% range on new lease for the year and expectations of the 4.5% to 5% range on renewals, which blends out to the 1% blended is what we're assuming for the full year."", 'Joshua Dennerlein', ""I appreciate that. And then there's a drag that you're assuming on the $400 million of acquisitions, is there a way to quantify that?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Yes, I think you can think -- Josh, you can think through what we're projecting new rates to come in, in this next year, and kind of the timing of those acquisitions from the standpoint of just the timing of it, we're assuming that those start in second quarter and then play out over the remainder over the year and we think about it maybe in the range, call it, 4 acquisitions at roughly $100 million each. And I think they'll look similar to what these other 2 acquisitions that we just completed in 2023 as far as how they will lease up and how they'll -- the drag that we'll see on earnings over 2024."", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""Josh, this is Brad. Just to add to that. Our assumption on the acquisitions is that obviously, as Clay mentioned, they're very similar to the ones we purchased last year. They're in lease-up. We're assuming about a 4.5% NOI yield contribution at the time of closing, given that those are in lease-up and given the comments that Clay made about where our current commercial paper is and where our cost of debt is, you can kind of do the math on what the dilution there is."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc."", 'Austin Todd Wurschmidt', ""Eric, you remain confident that new lease pricing is going to improve through this year, but it really sounds like peak deliveries don't hit until around midyear. And we've really yet to see, I guess, leasing volume pick up, so with kind of that expectation of the improvement in new lease rates for the year, do you think that lease rates get better in the back half of this year versus last year on sort of a lease-weighted basis? I know things deteriorate late in the year, but more interested in sort of that period of July through October."", 'H. Eric Bolton', ""Well, I'll answer your question, and Tim, you can jump in here. But probably speaking, yes, we do think that as you get into the summer leasing season, we've always traditionally seen leasing traffic pick up. And as commented in our prepared comments, I mean, we just see no evidence of demand really deteriorating. And we do think that normal seasonal patterns will continue to play out. So as we think about supply delivery, and we see it pretty elevated at this point. And I mean does it go up another 10%? I don't think so. I think that kind of we're in the sort of the peak of the storm from a supply perspective I feel like right now and a weak-demand quarter. And we think that supply now stays high, certainly in Q1 and Q2 and probably even early Q3, it's hard to peg it by month, but we do think that there is a lot of reasons to believe that supply starts to peter out or starts to moderate a little bit as you get into -- particularly into Q4. So we do think that the pressure surrounding supply that will persist will be met with even stronger leasing traffic and demand patterns as we get into the summer as a function of a normal seasonal patterns, and therefore, it does lead us to believe that new lease pricing performs better in Q2 and Q3. And as Tim alluded to, we expect -- again, it's a function of normal seasonal patterns that begins to moderate a little bit in Q4. And the other thing that I would just point out, of course, is that we began to see early effects of supply pressure really in 2023 and particularly in the latter part of 2023, so in some ways, you could also suggest that the prior year comparisons in terms of new lease-over-lease performance starts to get a little bit easier, if you will, in the back half of 2024. So collectively, that sort of leads us to the consensus of where we think things are headed. I mean, Tim, what would you add to that?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes. I'll add on to what Eric was saying. If you go back to last year, I mean, our new lease pricing went slightly negative starting in July, and it got -- progressively got more so throughout the year. So there is a comp component that plays into this as well. So I do think to answer one of your questions, Austin, is that new lease pricing does look better at the end of 2024 as compared to the end of 2023 with those comps, with supply getting a little bit better. Now I think the improvement won't be as clear to see because it is a lower demand time of the year when you get into November and December, but I think the trends will be positive and really start to play out in 2025."", 'Austin Todd Wurschmidt', ""When do you guys think the lease rate growth could turn positive? And then just my second question is, I'm just curious how -- what underlying assumptions in same-store revenue guidance changed the most relative to what you published in November of last year?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""I think likely new lease pricing probably doesn't go positive until 2025. I think it will get close to flat, probably in the middle of this year and the highest demand part of the year. But even in a, I'll call normal year or a good year, we typically see new lease pricing is negative in the back part of the year. So I think likely, it's early 2025 as we see the flat pressure start to moderate more, so I think that's probably the most likely scenario for new lease pricing. As far as what changed, I mean, it was really, really to earn in, which is based on what we saw in November and December, as I mentioned in my comments, it was pricing really moderated quite a bit, particularly in November and December, which the way we calculate our earn-in is just basically saying all right, all the leases that were in place at the end of December 31, if they all price this year for the rest of the year, what would our range growth be in that -- so the earnings more in the 0.5 range, a little bit lower than that range we talked about at NAREIT, but really driven by the new lease pricing in November and December and the pressure we saw from the developers and looking for occupancy and that sort of thing."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital."", 'John P. Kim', ""I wanted to follow up on that comment you just made on the earn-in that basically half of what you expected in November. I realize the blended rates probably came in lower than expected. But you also mentioned, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the leasing volume was very light in the fourth quarter, it's only 16% of leases overall. I'm just trying to understand that impact of the fourth quarter leases and why earn-in has come down so much in just the month."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes. I mean it's a basic idea on that. I mean I think the other component that played into is we did -- we saw turnover for the year down, but November and December, we had a little bit higher weighting on new lease pricing as compared to renewals. So more new leases in November and December than renewals which obviously, with the new lease pricing was a bigger impact on the blended. Now we've seen that shift more so to what we think will happen throughout the course of 2024, which is we're waiting. We think turnover remained down and be weighted a little more towards renewals. So while we have seen new lease pricing improve in January, the blend had improved even more as we've seen more of what we think will be the lower turnover component. So it's really just that. Like I said, we're -- that's comparing at the lowest part of it what was the main part of the year. We do expect blended to be positive in 2024. So I think that's calculating loss lease earn-in, whatever you want to call it, the end of December, certainly the most pessimistic time to look at it, but it was that pricing that drove it."", 'John P. Kim', 'But when you calculate earn-in, do you just take the blended lease change for your entire portfolio and just not weighted by number of transactions, such as the cap rate basically?', 'Timothy P. Argo', ""No. We just said when we talk about earn-in, we're just saying, okay, if our total rents were $2 billion at the end of December, and/or if we take just December, whatever that number was for rent and applied that all the way through 2024, what is the full year growth over 2023. And so where that ends up, can affect that number here now."", 'John P. Kim', 'Okay. My second question is on acquisition yields, which the last 2 were at 5.5% and 5.9%. How do you see that move towards this year when you see more acquisition activity occur? And your recent bond rate is done at 5.1%. How does that change your view on initial yields that are acceptable to you?', 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""John, this is Brad. I'll start off with that. Well, certainly, we were fortunate with the 2 acquisitions that we executed in the fourth quarter. And we felt like we got really good pricing on those for the reasons I mentioned really in my comments, but we haven't seen a lot of activity in that area. And so even in the first quarter here in January, we've seen a little bit of an uptick in terms of the deals coming out. We were at NMHC last week and certainly think that, that volume picks up a little bit as we go through the year. But we haven't seen a lot of opportunities coming that way. Now we do think as we continue to get further into the year, that pressure given where interest costs are for the developers, given the supply pressures that they're likely to feel that the urgency from some of these developers to execute on transactions will continue to increase, and we're certainly hopeful that, that yields additional opportunities. The other thing that we are watching, frankly, is some of the larger equity sponsors and what their exposure is to other sectors, whether that's retail or office and some of them have big exposures to multifamily development, and some of them have liquidity needs, which necessitates that they execute transactions in some of the multifamily space. So we're having some discussions with folks like that. We're certainly hopeful that, that will yield some opportunities. But I do think that the pricing expectations on the seller side is still a bit lower than where we think pricing needs to be. Pricing expectations are still low 5s. So we still need to see some movement up in cap rates from where those expectations are for the market to really pick up. So it's an area that we continue to work on. And we do think that there'll be more opportunities as we get through this year."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""I appreciate all the color on rents and how you think you can inflect more positive, but I guess, this is like a case study. If you think about your weakest market, your deepest supply-challenged market, and what do you think the pace of rents look like in that market or the kind of the quarterly improvement? Or is it still weak into '25? I think just looking for like the worst-case scenario so we can build on the better."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Well, I mean I will say when we talked about construction starts that peaked somewhere around the middle of 2022, that is pretty consistent across our markets. There are a few that were a little bit lighter than few or a little bit earlier than that. So it is a relatively consistent supply wave in terms of the timing. Obviously, some markets are getting a lot more supply than others, which drives under or overperformance. I mean, Austin is the market we talked about forever, that is our weakest one right now. I mean it's just getting a ton of supply, it's very widespread throughout the market, whereas some other markets are a little more targeted. So that's one that has probably been the worst new lease performance right now. So I mean, I think a market like that will continue to struggle through most of 2024, probably be 2025 before it starts to see a little bit of improvement. But I would say that, again, sort of the cadence of supply is relatively consistent across most of our markets."", 'H. Eric Bolton', ""And just to add to what Tim is saying, while the cadence of supply is fairly consistent, where you do see a lot of differences on occasion is by market, some -- the percent of new supply coming to the market as a percent of the existing stock will vary a bit. And then also, you see, of course, market differences in terms of demand and demand drivers. And so in a market like Austin, where it's probably one of our -- if not the most oversupplied market that we have or supply high relative to percent of existing stock. It also happens to be one of the strongest job growth markets that we have. And probably, as a consequence of that, we're seeing absorption rates, if you will, probably running higher in Austin than we would in a market like Dallas or some of the others that are also getting a lot of supply, but maybe not quite the level. I think Dallas obviously is getting a lot of job growth. But a market like Jacksonville, where you're not getting quite the level of job growth that you get in a market like Austin, so I think you have to be careful in trying to extrapolate 1 market to the whole portfolio in terms of performance expectations because it will vary quite a bit, and that's obviously why we diversify the way we do. As Tim and Brad alluded to in their comments, this is why we also have a mid-tier market component to our portfolio where we're seeing some of these mid-term markets holding up in a much more steady fashion than some of the others. So I think that the question about how quickly any given market steps through the -- or steps back through the supply pipeline, if you will, is going to largely be a function of the demand factors that we see in those markets. And a market like Austin, we think has huge potential long term for us and it steps back pretty strong, probably late this year and more likely into early '25."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. That's helpful. Yes. I mean the question is coming from -- I think most of you and most of your peers are thinking that by the end of the year, a lot of these markets are much better. So that's what I'm trying to figure out like what -- so maybe if you guys pick the market, like what do you think is going to be the market that has the most pain for the longest period combining both job growth projections and supply just so we can at least keep our eyes on that to see like this is the worst case?"", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', 'Yes. I would put Austin in that group, for sure.', 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes, I'll agree. Also, I mean it's just -- it's getting a lot of supply and frankly, without the level of job growth that would be worse off than it is. So getting a ton of jobs, but probably going to take some time to work through."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""That's helpful. And then thinking about the acquisition opportunities, I mean, you currently have very low leverage versus your peers. How high would you be willing to take that leverage if you found the right opportunities? And then what do you view as your absolute buying power right now?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Yes. I think just from a leverage standpoint, we would be comfortable moving it up to 4.5% to close to 5%. And of course, that would take a lot of time at this -- at the rate that we're looking at these coming through to get to that point. But we would be comfortable taking our leverage up to that point."", 'James Colin Feldman', 'Do you have a sense of total dollar amount?', 'Clay Holder', 'I think that gets to roughly $1.5 billion.', 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.', 'Daniel Peter Tricarico', ""It's Dan Tricarico for Nick. Brad, you talked about the improving absorption in the back half of the year. Can you comment on what you're seeing on the demand side, job growth, migration that gives you this confidence? Maybe the general economic outlook embedded in the guide? Maybe said another way, what household formation or job growth scenario gets you to the low end of guidance?"", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""Yes. Well, I'll start out, Tim can certainly jump in here. But a couple of points I'll make here on the demand side is definitely the traditional demand drivers that we see, whether it's job growth, population growth, migration trends, all of those are still very, very positive and steady within our region of the country. And those will continue to be significant drivers over the long term for us. But we also see another dynamic that's kind of at play here. And a big part of that has to do with the single-family market and really has to do with the affordability and the availability that we see there. As Tim mentioned in his opening comments, we've seen a significant decline in the move-outs to buy a home. That's down 20% year-over-year with us. And if you look at the cost of buying a home in our reach of the country, it's up significantly over the last couple of years, the monthly cost of homeownership is about 50% to 60% higher than the rents are within our region of the country. So that's a significant hurdle for most people. We've also seen the construction starts in the single-family sector continue to decline. So the inventory level of available single-family continues to decline. And so we think that's a pushing segment of demand into multifamily. And it's also pushing folks to stay longer in multifamily. We've seen the average tenure of our residents up to almost 2 years now. So that's got a demand component to it as well. And then we've also seen some preference shift within the demographics that are our rental demographics, honestly, and that is a preference to live alone. And so that also is extending the household formation numbers that we're seeing. And so all of that really combines to point to a point that Eric made in his comments, which is that apartment rental continues to make a higher -- make up a higher percentage of the occupied housing. And so as we look out and see demand in our region of the country, those traditional drivers continue to be important, but there's also this other component that is really adding to the demand component that we see in our region of the country. Tim, what would you add?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes. I'll add a couple of points there. I mean I think the job growth component and how much there is will be probably more likely the factor that determines to your original question, kind of high and low end, that sort of thing. I mean, I think we expect be in migration and all things Brad just noted to be there and that component of demand to be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years. We've dialed in about 400,000 new jobs into our expectations for our markets for 2024, that's down certainly from 2023, but still net positive and so expect job reprices in the Sunbelt markets. And encouragingly, if you look at the national job growth numbers from January added, I think, about 350,000 new jobs in January. You compare that back to 2023, the average is about 250,000 a month. So while we do expect job growth to be down some to 2023, the early indications are that it's still holding up pretty well."", 'Daniel Peter Tricarico', ""That's great color. Follow-up on development. You have 3 or 4 development starts this year, development starts. What markets are those in? And what are underwritten stabilized yields on those? And I guess, along the same line, you talked about Austin being the weakest. You stabilized Windmill Hill in Austin in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how that asset leased up versus your expectations? And obviously, a little bit more suburban, but how do you expect that asset to perform within the Austin market this year, given it's expected to be one of the weaker markets?"", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""This is Brad. A couple of comments. On the development side, yes, we do have 3 to 4 starts that we expect this year, 2 in the first half. One of those is in Charlotte. The other one is in the Phoenix Chandler submarket of Phoenix. We've got 2 other ones that we're working on. One is a Phase 2 in Denver, the other one is a Phase 2 in Atlanta. And in terms of the yields we're seeing there, we are pushing those at the moment to -- we're repricing all of those, trying to get the construction cost down to really get to a yield, call it, mid-6s. That's really what our goal is. We have had some success on the project in Charlotte, we've been able to get between 5% and 6% reduction in the construction costs, which really helps support our ability to get that yield. So we feel really good about where we are with those developments. And then the two that are late in the year are Phase 2 projects. So we're hopeful that the yields there continue to increase as we get further construction costs out of those as well. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question, Nick?"", 'Daniel Peter Tricarico', 'The Windmill Hill in Austin in 4Q, how is that -- go ahead.', 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""Yes, that asset performed extremely well for us. The average rents that we achieved on that asset were almost 24% higher than what we expected. So from a yield perspective, significantly outperformed what we expected. And part of that was you mentioned it's a suburban asset in Austin, great execution on the property, had 2 adjacent lease-ups going on at the same time as it, but we were very patient in how we leased that asset up. We didn't have to offer concessions to meet the market and really perform extremely well there. So I think given the execution on the construction side as well as the leasing side, we did not have to compete quite as much head-to-head with some of the competition that was in that market, and we've got pretty good results there."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from Eric Wolfe with Citi."", 'Eric Wolfe', ""So I understand your point on comps getting easier through the year, especially in the fourth quarter. But if the largest amount of supply is delivering in the middle of this year, it takes like a year to lease up. I guess why would Brent start recovering sort of later this year before the developments are fully leased? Isn't there typically like a compounding effect of the supply?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Well, I think one is the -- while we're talking about complete or starts peaked in the middle of 2022, it has been pretty steady. So I think we've seen a relatively steady level of supply being delivered over the last several quarters. And then we have the steady level of demand as well. I mean we have seen absorption keep up pretty well, even though supply compounded, as you said, certainly certain markets are a little bit different. But the other thing is middle of the year obviously is the strongest demand component. And so I think the timing of that with the timing of most of our traffic and most of the demand coming in is what we believe keep it from -- we talked about we think new lease pricing has kind of bottomed helps keep it from getting worse than where it is now, just sort of that normal seasonality and all the different demand factors that we've talked about. And then you'll have a few months after the middle after its peak where there's still pressure, but we typically see it start to drop a few months after the final deliveries, which what gives us some confidence in the back half of the year that we start to see some improvement."", 'H. Eric Bolton', ""And as Tim mentioned, I mean, we also -- I mean, we assume that new lease pricing moderates in the fourth quarter, and that's also what's important to remember, that's also why we stagger our lease expirations the way we do such that we're repricing a smaller percent of leases of the portfolio in that holiday period of November and December. So I understand the point that you're making, but we feel like that we've accounted for that both in terms of our new lease-over-lease pricing performance expectations, seasonal patterns, if you will, but also just the way we manage lease expirations over the course of the year. So we think that we've got it dialed in appropriately. And we do think that as we get into -- again, it varies by market so much. So it's hard to make any real conclusive broad observations as it relates to the point that you're making. But we do think that there are certain markets, for sure, that we begin to see the supply pressures meaningfully moderate in terms of new coming in late in the year, and that begins to establish some early signs of recovery in that new lease pricing performance as we head into 2025."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""I think one more point I'll add just back to the kind of the middle of the year. I mean, we're still dialing in somewhere in the negative 2.5% range during that strongest period of 2024 for new lease pricing. So we certainly don't see getting positives yet. But I think with the demand components that it will be a little bit better than what we're seeing right now."", 'Eric Wolfe', ""And then just maybe a quick clarification on the earn-in. Does that include your sort of loss or gain to lease a real-time changes in market rents? Or is it based purely off the leases signed up at one point in time? Just trying to understand if like real-time move-to-market rents ends up impacting that earn-ins such that it's always going to end up being low end at the year-end."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes. Well, for the earn-in like I said, it's basically just saying all the leases that were in place at the end of 2023, so call it, all the December leases just held steady for all '24 that's earned in. I mean, loss to lease, how we think about that, if you look at all of the leases that went effective in January compared to our in place, it's about a negative 1% loss lease looking at it that way. But we are dialing it in, as we said, positive 1% blended for the course of 2024."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush."", 'Richard Anderson', ""So what do you make of this January effect that's happening? Like you guys have seen this sort of recovery in January. Some of your peers -- many of your peers have seen the same thing. It's still freaking cold outside. Why do you think January is recovering the way it is for you and others at this point?"", 'H. Eric Bolton', ""Two reasons. One, you don't have the holidays in January. I think nobody likes to move during Christmas and -- or Thanksgiving. I think holiday effect is real. And I think it weighs on people's interest in moving. Secondly, I think that there are -- and we have seen some evidence to suggest that some developers were facing kind of a calendar year-end pressure point. And I think that we -- as we started to see in the early part of the fourth quarter as we were approaching year-end, developer lease-up practices were getting increasingly aggressive as we're headed towards the holidays. And I think a calendar year-end and so I just think that developer practices got a little bit more aggressive in the holidays and approaching the year-end. And I think that to some degree, there was some moderation on that and certainly, absent the holidays, even though it is cold and so forth, I think people's capacity to deal with the hassle of moving just improves a little bit better once you get past the holidays and therefore, traffic picked up."", 'Richard Anderson', ""Do you think this holiday factor moderates in February, when it's still sort of a seasonally slow period of time through the January pickup and then you kind of get back to normal course sequential business? Is that fair?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes, I think that's a good reason."", 'Richard Anderson', ""And then second question is someone asked about how much you'd lever up and I appreciate that color. And I know you're sort of waiting for transaction market to be sort of more attractive to you to execute with still low cap rates. But you have sort of development opportunity sitting, I don't remember what the number was, but you got a lot that you can do right now. Why wouldn't you -- if you're going to deliver into 2026, which is likely to be a very good year to deliver, why not really accelerate development right now and have that be a part of the -- a bigger part of the external growth story? You seem to be slowing it down more than speeding it up at this point. So just curious on that."", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""Rich, this is Brad. Well, you're right, we do have a pretty big pipeline of projects that are ready that we could execute on. And really, it's just a matter of working the costs on those projects right now. I mean, as I mentioned, we are seeing early signs of costs coming down on the project in Charlotte, call it, 5% to 6%. We do think we'll continue to see costs come down as we get later into this year. So while we do expect to start 3 or 4 projects this year, we have another 4 to 5 that are approved, our plans are nearly ready. And if costs came in, we could certainly pull the trigger on those. So we have the optionality to be able to do that. But we think it's prudent to be sure that the costs are in line. We do also agree with you that these line up very, very well from a delivery perspective into 2026. The other area where we are seeing opportunity that I think could yield itself more immediately, is in our prepurchase area. So we are talking with developers on a number of opportunities where the projects are approved, entitled, plans are complete and in some instances, GMPs are already in place. But given some of the other liquidity constraints out there that I was talking about earlier, and pressures in other sectors, the equity or even the debt has pulled out of the project. So we are evaluating projects in that way. And so if we can find well-located opportunities with good partners that meet our return requirements, we'll definitely lean into that area a little bit more."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""So two questions, and apologies about the clock in the background. The first one is, can you just talk a little bit about renewals? I think you said you expect them to be sort of 5%, but new rents down 3%, so an 8% spread. Can you just walk us through why that -- that seems a rather widespread, but in your comments, you said that's sort of consistent with historic. So maybe you could just talk about that and why existing residents would accept an 8% spread versus new residents?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes. This is Tim, Alex. I mean, the gap is a little bit wider than historical, if we look at January, for example, it's about 1,100 basis point gap for the month. But if you look at last year at this time, it's about 900. And even if you look at over the last several years, really as long as we've been tracking it, Q1 runs about an 800 basis point gap. And even as you get into the spring and summer, there's typically always a gap where we see renewal pricing outperforming new lease pricing. But I mean, I think there's a few reasons for that, frankly, one, there is a real cost, but a hassle cost and a financial cost to moving. There is the customer service component. When we have someone that's lived with us and knows kind of what to expect and knows what kind of service you're going to get. If you look at our Google star ratings, we averaged 4.4 Google star rating in 2023, which is highest in the sector. 80% of our ratings were 5 star, and that is a component that plays out, it manifests itself in this way with our renewal pricing. And then we just -- we do dedicate a lot of time and resources to this renewal process. But in our corporate office and on the on-site teams, there's a lot of thought, there's a lot of factors considered, a lot of -- there's a level of buying that we get from our teams that get them comfortable with the rates we're sending out at. And again, that manifests itself well. So it will narrow and as we see new lease pricing, we expect to accelerate as we get into the spring and summer, that gap will narrow. But as I made -- in the prepared comments, if you look at February, March and even April, we're averaging right around that 5%. So I think that can hang in there, particularly as new lease rates start to accelerate around that same time frame."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Okay. And then the second question is on the supply front, it only seems like a handful of your markets have supply issues, but pressure on new rent seems to be broad-brushed. And yet, Sunbelt still as good economy, good jobs, good in migration. So how do you -- like we understand weakness in new rents in markets that have a lot of supply. But how do we interpret rent softness sort of portfolio-wise, especially in the market that aren't beset by supply? And clearly, your price point seems to be affordable for the community. So I just want to understand the non-supply markets, why there's been pressure there as well."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Well, we are seeing pretty good strength. And as I've commented on some of the mid-tier markets, if you think about Greenville, Savannah and Richmond and Charleston in those markets, we are seeing pretty good relative performance. I mean the supply is -- it obviously varies by market, we're seeing it a lot more in some of the larger markets. And I think, frankly, we're seeing it in some of our higher concentration markets. If you think about Austin and Charlotte and Dallas, some of our higher concentration markets is where there's more supply, which is not surprising, those are good markets to be in the sort of good long-term demand markets, and that's not really a surprise. So I think there's some of that market-concentration factor that's weighing into it, where those obviously have an outsized impact on what you see at the portfolio level overall. But if you look at 2023, for example, across all of our markets, deliveries were about 4 -- between 4% and 4.5% of inventory across the portfolio. So while it varies pretty widely by market, we did see pretty good -- the store leverage is probably 3% to 3.5%. So even for some of the ones that weren't getting ton of supply, they were still higher than average."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS."", 'Michael Goldsmith', ""My first question is on the expense -- on expenses. Can you walk through where -- which line items you're seeing particular pressure? And how you envision expense trending through the year?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Yes. Just a couple of things around expenses that I'd point to is, one, our uncontrollable expenses are really what's driving some of that expense growth whenever you kind of break that down. Real estate taxes are projected to grow at roughly 4.8% for the year. I think you saw that in our guidance. And then you have insurance that's growing at roughly 16% -- 15%, 16% for the year. So that continues to be a bit of a headwind for us as we go into 2024 and for all the same reasons that we've seen in previous years just as the market is trying to catch up there. Then when you get into some of our controllable expenses, really the biggest driver there is probably repair and maintenance while the other items around expenses are pretty much right there at that overall growth rate of 4.1% or actually even slightly lower than that."", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""And I'll add just a couple of points there on the controllable. I mean we do expect that if you look back to 2023 that all of those controllable line items will moderate in 2024 as compared to 2023 pretty significantly, and you can see that in the guide that we have. I think marketing is the one that's a little bit variable, may not -- we had pretty reasonable marketing costs in 2023. And certainly in the environment we're in, that's something we want to make sure we're careful about to make sure we're properly spending there. So that may be the one where you don't see a significant decrease, but I think the others will see some pretty good moderation."", 'Michael Goldsmith', 'And my follow-up is on concessions. How have concessions and competing properties trended? And are you offering any concessions that your stabilized property?', 'Timothy P. Argo', ""I mean the concessions for us, it stabilized. It's pretty minimal, I think, across the portfolio, we're about 0.5% or so of rents and concessions. And with the way we price, there's a lot of net pricing, we don't do a ton of concessions. We do see it more in some of the lease-ups that we're competing against. I would say in general, concessions in the market and what we're competing against with went up a little bit in Q4, probably where we saw the biggest change, some of our Carolina markets, Charlotte and Raleigh were ones and we saw concessions pick up a little bit, but still in terms of lease-up and areas of lot of development, the concession practices is still pretty strong kind of that 1 month to 2-months range."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Going back to your comments on your 5% renewal rate. I guess I'm curious if that 5% renewal pricing does hold, but market rate growth is just 1%. Are you creating a gain and how do you feel about that going into next year in line of the outlook for rental rates to recover?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', 'You cut out there a little bit and now you said a gain lease, is that what you were saying?', 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Yes, I was saying that if the 5% renewal rate forecast that you're expecting that it does hold and market rate growth is just 1%, are creating a gain to lease? And then how would that impact your outlook for next year when you're expecting market rates to recover or you let your portfolio to recover?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes. I mean, like I said, the gap is a little wider right now, but I expect it to come in. We haven't seen any signs like say, going all the way out to April. We're still kind of in that 5% range. And obviously, depends on the mix and who's renewing his new lease. We typically -- our average stays somewhere in the 20-month range, somebody leases and then they do one renewal and typically move it out. So all this stuff, you're not renewing on top of renewing and top of renewing where that gap continues to get larger and larger. But as I said, we've always seen a gap there and a little bit wider right now, but I expect it to narrow as we get into the spring. But no concerns with where we sit here right now."", 'H. Eric Bolton', ""And I'll just add, Haendel, that I mean, over time, to the extent that obviously, the new lease pricing pressure we're seeing right now is obviously largely a function of supply coming into the market. If that begins to moderate late this year into 2025 in the event that we do see renewal pricing need to moderate a little bit more next year, call it, instead of 5%, we're in the 3% or 4% range, we also, though, expect new lease pricing to start to show some improvement next year such that we probably continue to get the blended performance that we need and that we're after. So it's a give and take back and forth. We've always historically seen new lease pricing in that kind of 4% to 5% range. I don't recall it ever really materially getting a lot lower than that. Maybe there was a year -- back 2 years ago where it got to 3%, but generally, when that's happening and certainly, we think that will be the scenario this time. By that point, our new lease pricing has started to show some improvements such that the overall blended performance continues to hang in there pretty well."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""I appreciate that, Eric. I guess I'm just thinking ahead and thinking of potentially that renewal rates would need to drop next year, how much CBD unless market rate growth does improve an increase maybe into the mid- to single -- upper single-digit rate growth."", 'H. Eric Bolton', 'Yes.', 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""One more. I appreciate the color you guys gave on the building blocks of same-store revenue, but could you give us some color on what you're assuming for bad debt, ancillary and for turnover?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Haendel, on bad debt, I would -- the way that we're thinking about that is it will remain pretty consistent with where it's run here recently. I mean we'd probably run around that 0.5 percentage point range, turnover staying low, at least for our guidance, we're staying low around that 45% range. And then what was the last one that you asked about?"", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', 'Fee income.', 'Clay Holder', ""Yes, fee income, we're assuming it will grow pretty much in line with our overall effective rent growth, so right around that 1% level."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""And then one last one. I think it was last quarter, there's a lot of chatter around A versus B rental pricing and the impact that the new supply was having on that dynamic. Curious if there's any updated perspective, anything that you've seen in this past quarter or any updated views on the performance of A versus B in your portfolio is or has changed over the last quarter or so?"", 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes. I mean we've probably seen it gap a little bit. I mean RBs, whatever you would call these or even if you want to think about suburban versus urban, suburban is outperforming, urban kind of the CBD and the interim loop. If you think about suburban, we're probably about 80 basis points better in Q4 January on a blended lease-over-lease basis from what we're seeing on the secondary, A versus B, the way we think about our portfolio, it's about 55% A, 45% B, a little bit tighter there, probably about a 30 basis point gap with the Bs doing a little bit better. Occupancy pretty consistent for both. But I would say the biggest notable thing there is certainly suburban assets are outperforming and with a little bit of less supply in those areas as well."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets."", 'Bradley Barrett Heffern', ""First, I just want to say congratulations to Al. Hope you enjoy your retirement. On your lease-ups, can you talk about how those are going in terms of pace? Obviously, you're outperforming on the rent side, but I'm just curious if they're taking longer than normal just given the supply backdrop?"", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""Yes, this is Brad. Those are pretty much in line with our expectations. Certainly, there's been a slowdown in the velocity in line with our overall portfolio kind of over the holidays and the winter months. But there's nothing material in terms of difference there versus what we expected. Our Daybreak asset is leasing up a little bit slower and has been. But in general, all of our assets, and that's the one in Salt Lake City. But in general, all of our assets are leasing up pretty much in line with our expectations in terms of velocity, given the slowdown here over the winter season."", 'Bradley Barrett Heffern', ""Okay. Got it. And maybe I missed it, but can you give your expectation for market rent growth that's underlying the guide? Obviously, you gave the blended assumption, but just looking specifically for the market piece."", 'Timothy P. Argo', 'Our blended, as we talked about, is about 1%. And we really -- we expect market rent, if you will, to be pretty consistent with where it is right now.', 'Bradley Barrett Heffern', 'Sorry, consistent as in flat or consistent as in similar to the 1% number?', 'Timothy P. Argo', ""Yes, flat. 1% is what we're expecting in terms of our blending growth."", 'Operator', ""And we'll ask -- our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley."", 'Adam Kramer', 'Just wanted to -- I think we talked a little bit about capital allocation and potential opportunities with acquisitions or developments. Pretty similar question, and again, recognizing where the balance sheet leverage is, so I was just wondering about the opportunity or maybe the appetite for share buybacks here? Or is that something you can consider? And maybe kind of what it would take for that to be under greater consideration?', 'H. Eric Bolton', ""Well, I mean, as you point out, I mean, we do think that attractive acquisition opportunities are going to start merging later this year into 2025. Merchant builders continues to struggle with their lease-up more likely than not below what they underwrote. And so we believe for the moment that at current pricing, the longer-term yield performance that we can pick up on acquiring these lease-up properties provides a more attractive long-term investment return, especially on an after-CapEx basis as compared to investing in our existing portfolio, our earnings stream. We also see it providing a better ability to continue investing in our new tech initiatives that we think offer the opportunity for meaningful margin expansion over the entire portfolio over the next few years, creating significant amounts of value. And then as you know, I mean, there's a REIT. We've long oriented our thinking around the idea that the best way for us to reward shareholders over a long period of time is through the dividend and through earnings' growth. And we think that continuing to find ways to put capital to work that supports those first 2 agenda items I just mentioned, in supporting our ability to continue to push dividend growth through all phases of the cycle over time is the best way to reward REIT capital. Having said all that, I mean, we obviously continue to monitor the public pricing of our existing portfolio and the company and obviously interested in continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet. I mean if we continue to see dislocation or even more dislocation in terms of public versus private pricing of the real estate, I mean we do have a buyback program in place, authorization in place. We've done it before and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again if conditions warranted it. But for right now, given the outlook and the opportunity we think we have in front of us, we think better to sort of hold on to our podder and we think the long-term value proposition is likely better with the focus that we have."", 'Adam Kramer', ""Great. And you mentioned some of the tech investments and kind of the opportunity set there. Maybe just, I don't know, I wonder 2 there that you're most excited about and you're kind of able to share with the public?"", 'Adrian Bradley Hill', ""Yes. I mean -- this is Brad. You've definitely heard of these in the past, but I'd say number one is our continued investment in our CRM platform. And we rolled this out a couple of quarters back when we continue to update and refine that platform, which really allows better management of our prospects and our leasing process. And this is also really an enabler to a number of other things that we're working on, our centralization, our specialization, our podding. All of those things have kind of our CRM platform at the center of those. We continue to focus on our podding of properties. We've got -- we're up to 27 podded properties today and we'll continue to look to expand that when opportunities present themselves. We're also investing right now and updating our website. We're hopeful that we'll be able to roll this out later this month. And really our goal there is to be able to drive more leasing traffic through our website, which is the most cost-effective way for us to do that. We get a larger portion of our traffic now through our website, and we're looking to continue to improve that. We're also really working to optimize our mobile -- our website for mobile use, which will support our online leasing and our self-touring. The last one that I'll mention is we're rolling out right now a property-wide WiFi on select properties this year. We're also adding this on some of our new developments. And this is really an opportunity for our residents to have really seamless WiFi across our property, whether it's in the unit, common areas, amenities and really provides a better opportunity in service for our residents, and that has a really big revenue component to it as well that we are testing at the moment."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our last question from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""I'm sorry to extend an already long call. But you had mentioned an expectation you think rental decline. You've decent amount of exposure to floating rate debt. Can you talk about your -- what's in your guidance in terms of rates this year? And then as of the year-end, you had $500 million on the commercial paper facility. Do you expect to keep that in place all year -- do you think you pay that down? Or is that already paid down?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Yes. We -- Jamie, we paid that down in the first week of January with the bond issuance that we completed and that effective rate on that issuance was right up just north of 5%. The place we look to the next dollar is our commercial paper program. And right now, it's at roughly 5.5%, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And as rates are expected to decrease over the back half over the year, we expect that number to maybe come down a bit."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""What's your assumption in your guidance for where rates go?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Yes, we've got a dropping down of 25 basis points through halfway through the year and then an another 25 basis points on the very back end of the year."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. So you're down 75 basis points by year-end?"", 'Clay Holder', 'No. Just 50, 25 and 25 at the end of the year.', 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. And then you had mentioned a $0.05 drag from developments that are not stabilized yet. Is there any variability to that? Is any of that being capitalized? There couldn't be so much of a hit to earnings?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Yes, there is some capitalization there. And when you look at our capital -- interest capitalized year-over-year, a slight increase, but pretty steady. But what really comes into play there is just the timing of the developments. In 2023, we delivered and leased up 2 developments in 2024. We're going to be delivering and leasing up 4 developments. And so you got a bit of a play there that's creating some headwind. And then in general, just the overall the rate at which we're capping that interest comes into play. You're looking at an effective rate, roughly 3.5% that we're capping and then we're borrowing at a higher rate today than what we've capped at previously."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. So I guess like even if you have an aggressive lease-up or lease up better than expectation, do you think that $0.05 is still locked in? Or there's a way that could go away?"", 'Clay Holder', 'I mean it would have to be a pretty meaningful change in how that would lease up to really move the needle on the $0.05.', 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. And then finally, just a clarification. I think you had mentioned 0.85% is your blend assumption. And then you answered the last question with 1%. I know we're splitting hairs here, but is 0.85% still the right number? Or is it 1%?"", 'Clay Holder', ""Yes. So our blended number is 1%. So that's the blended pricing we've got built into our revenue guidance, but our overall effective rent growth is the 0.85%. So that 0.85% includes the earn-in that we've got for -- from 2023 plus the 1% of the blended that we're looking at for 2024."", 'Operator', 'We have no further questions at this time. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.', 'H. Eric Bolton', ""All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning, and we'll, I'm sure, speak to many of you over the spring. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.""]"

Its revenue fell 10% year over year to $1.2 billion. The chipmaker's non-GAAP diluted earnings were down to $1.97 per share from $2.59 per share in the preceding year. Additionally, Skyworks' revenue guidance of $1.02 to $1.07 billion for the current quarter points toward a 10% drop from the year-ago quarter at the midpoint."", ""All this explains why Skyworks stock has dropped almost 11% in the past year, underperforming the broader semiconductor sector by a wide margin.

Apple sold just over 234 million smartphones last year. The company's annual shipments could jump significantly to 460 million units in 2027 if it manages to increase its share of the smartphone market to 25%, driven by the integration of AI features into its upcoming iPhone."", ""Given Skyworks' tight relationship with Apple, the chipmaker could ride the coattails of its largest client and return to growth.

In a memo to staff, CEO Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito pointed to dramatic industry shifts “and perhaps most profound, new technologies are poised to transform our industry — and every other industry.” While Fink has been outspoken about his belief in AI’s potential to turbocharge productivity, the new tech was not cited as a reason for the cuts. The asset manager still expects to have a larger staff by the end of the year as it expands certain parts of the business, according to the memo.', 'Experts struggle to get an accurate picture of just how many jobs are being eliminated as AI rapidly advances. Since last May, US companies have announced more than 4,600 jobs cuts in order to free up resources to hire people with AI experience or because the technology replaced tasks, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. But that estimate is “certainly undercounting” the true total, Senior Vice President Andrew Challenger said in an interview.', '“There are probably more jobs in the economy that are being cut because of AI already than are getting attributed to that or announced. Every time a company mentions it, they get headlines across every news outlet for like a month,” Challenger said. “They would rather go under the radar most of the time.”', 'Last spring, International Business Machines Corp. drove headlines across the world when Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg the company planned to pause hiring it thinks it could soon replace with AI. An IBM spokesperson said the company does not have a hiring freeze in place and plans to keep headcount level this year.', 'Johnny Taylor, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, agreed that many of these kinds of cuts will happen quietly.', '“IBM was a leader and was public about it, and got beaten up pretty bad,” Taylor said in an interview in December. “So the rest of them have said ‘We’re not going to announce it, I’m just going to do it.’ We’re going to reduce our headcount.”', 'Many firms may do that by significantly slowing hiring, he said. “We will wake up three years from now and see much leaner organizations,” he said. “They will have replaced you without making a big announcement.”', 'So far, most AI-related cuts have been in the tech industry, according to Challenger’s tally. Some companies, like homework help site Chegg and programmer help site Stack Overflow, cut staff after their businesses were directly undercut by AI products. Other companies, like file-storage service Dropbox, raced to refocus on the new technology, letting go of staff to make way for new hires with AI skill sets.', 'After IBM, only a handful of companies have explicitly tied AI to job cuts or hiring freezes.', 'In December, the Swedish buy now, pay later firm Klarna Inc. said it would freeze hiring as tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT cut down the time certain tasks take. “We need fewer people to do the same thing,” CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph. “The right thing for us is just to say: ‘let’s not recruit now, let’s see how this plays out.’” A spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment further.', 'In January, language-learning software company Duolingo Inc. chose not to renew about 10% of its contractors.', '“We just no longer need as many people to do the type of work some of these contractors were doing. Part of that could be attributed to AI,” a spokesperson told Bloomberg, adding that Duolingo does not have a hiring freeze in place and is actively recruiting for a wide range of roles. The company said no full-time employees were affected and that the job reduction isn’t a “straight replacement” of workers with AI, as many of its full-time employees and contractors use the technology in their work.', 'These companies aren’t alone in their thinking, even if others don’t say it out loud: Three out of four Fortune 500 chief human resources officers surveyed by Gallup last year said they see AI replacing jobs in their company in the next three years.', '“Let\'s not pretend — jobs are going to go away because of AI,"" said Bob Toohey, chief human resources officer at insurer Allstate Corp., adding that he was referring to the overall labor market, not his company specifically. “There will be jobs lost, and also jobs enhanced.”', 'In his own department, Toohey said AI will change the work of the so-called learning and development teams that train Allstate employees in, say, a new method of handling claims. What once was a three-week process of creating content can now take less than a day. “We are right in the throes of this now,” he said.', ""In the tech industry, some top executives have warned AI could eliminate certain jobs, with Elon Musk going so far as to say, “There will come a point where no job is needed.” But for the companies currently introducing AI to workers, there's often a more positive spin."", '“The big thing you’ll hear companies say is they’re not focused on elimination, but augmentation — trying to make people more effective and efficient,” Challenger said. “But clearly there are a lot of scenarios right now where one person could do the work of four or five people with the help of AI in a way they couldn’t a year ago.

International Business Machines (IBM) (NYSE: IBM) languished for years as a dinosaur technology company struggling to find its footing in a cloud-driven market.', ""After declining steadily for the past decade, IBM has come alive due to its potential with artificial intelligence (AI). Shares are up 36% over the past year alone. There is legitimacy to IBM's revival, but investors must be careful not to overpay because there might be more hype than substance."", ""Is that the case for IBM today? Let's look at how AI affects IBM right now and gauge just how good IBM stock might be to buy."", ""Once a technology titan, IBM was left behind when the arrival of the cloud disrupted its legacy enterprise hardware business. It's reinvented itself over the years, becoming a mixture of hardware, software, and consulting solutions, but it's struggled to grow consistently. It shed its IT infrastructure services business in 2021, spinning it off as Kyndryl, and that's helping IBM start to grow again."", 'Now, IBM believes artificial intelligence can carry the torch for future revenue growth. During its fourth-quarter earnings report, management commented that bookings for Watsonx and generating AI roughly doubled in the three months from the third quarter to Q4. That sounds encouraging. IBM grew revenue by 2% in 2023 over 2022, and 2024 guidance calls for accelerating to mid-single-digit revenue growth companywide. This evidence supports the assertion that IBM is seeing a notable uptick in its business.', ""This is excellent news for the company, but investors should be careful not to get too excited. After all, mid-single-digit revenue growth doesn't exactly scream hyper-growth stock that investors should unquestioningly pay anything for."", ""So, let's look at IBM's financial big picture."", ""Just because IBM is growing doesn't necessarily make it a growth stock. The company's financials will show that IBM is anything but a high-growth investment opportunity. AI potential has excited analysts enough to raise their long-term earnings growth estimates. Boosting estimates from 5% to 6.7% is a significant uptick percentage-wise, but from a numbers standpoint, it is not that big a difference from where it was."", ""Additionally, the company is deeply in debt thanks to continual acquisitions and spending. There is roughly 3.8 times more long-term debt on the balance sheet than IBM's EBITDA, which is a ratio I generally like to see under 2.5. Then, factor in IBM's commitment to the dividend, which shows up in its 28-year streak of consecutive dividend raises. The dividend costs roughly $6 billion, half of IBM's guided free cash flow for 2024."", ""This isn't meant to be a put-down of IBM, but investors need to see a company for what it is. IBM is a fine dividend stock. The dividend yield is 3.5% today, and there's enough growth to fund more increases, while the $6 billion in leftover cash flow can help management repurchase shares or pay down debt. It doesn't do investors any good to try to paint the company as something it's not, especially in the face of broader AI excitement. This is not another Nvidia."", ""As a dividend stock, paying a reasonable valuation is even more crucial. A severe overpayment can create years of poor returns while the underlying business catches up to the stock's price tag."", ""IBM's big rally over the past year has bumped the valuation from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14 to over 18. Is 18 times earnings a good price to pay for the stock? It may not be if IBM can't outperform analysts' projected 6% to 7% earnings growth estimates. That's a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of roughly 3, which is about double the ratio I prefer."", ""Again, IBM is a fine dividend stock, and the accelerating revenue growth in 2024 is encouraging. But investors looking for total returns may have missed the big move. Of course, the stock could keep going up, but it's getting hard to like its chances of solid returns."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 22% also doesn't go unnoticed by us.

Underlying share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.The company’s volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to have benefited from the ongoing recovery in markets. Category-wise, volumes have been benefiting from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Our model predicts year-over-year organic revenue growth of 8.8% for the fourth quarter, mainly driven by 6.9% growth of the price/mix and a 1.9% rise in concentrate sales volume. Consequently, reported revenue growth is expected to be 3.9%. For 2023, our model estimates organic revenue growth of 10.7%, with a 9.3% rise in price/mix and a 1.5% increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola’s fourth-quarter and 2023 results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. It has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture online demand, which is likely to have boosted fourth-quarter sales.However, KO has been witnessing inflationary cost pressures, related to higher commodity and material costs, as well as higher marketing investments. The elevated commodity costs have been hurting the company’s cost of goods sold (COGS). The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management anticipated inflationary cost pressures to impact several aspects of the business in 2023, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses. KO expects impacts of a mid-single-digit percentage from commodity price inflation on the comparable COGS for 2023. Our model predicts a 1.9% year-over-year increase in the cost of products sold in the fourth quarter and a 3.1% year-over-year rise for 2023.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth, with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. The company has been significantly increasing its marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers, and attracting new ones.

But it's the details of this last strategy shift that have investors most excited."", '""We think there has been a seismic change in the past six months,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the conference call regarding the EV market in the US, in which “EV manufacturers [are] cutting their price by 20% across all major geographies, and a tremendous amount of capital is flowing and a ton of new capacity into one single segment — two-row crossovers.”', 'Ford’s rethink of the EV market is still to invest, and somewhat heavily, it seems, into its Model e business unit but focus more on its Gen 2 EVs, which will bypass that “two-row crossover market” dominated by Tesla and other manufacturers. Farley said Ford will push into larger EVs like trucks and also try to capitalize on the new space.', ""“We're going to focus those large EVs on geographies and product segments where we have a dominant advantage like trucks and vans,” Farley said, then revealing that Ford is also “adjusting our capital, switching more focus on to smaller EV products.”"", 'This means Farley and Ford essentially are abandoning that middle market for EVs.', 'The pivot to smaller EVs is a new wrinkle for Ford, which had pulled out of the entry-level sedan/compact market for its gas-powered cars in recent years, focusing its EV efforts on upmarket products like the Mustang Mach-E crossover and full-size Lightning pickup.', 'Farley revealed more of Ford’s small EV plans, claiming they had been in the works for some time. Over the past two years, Ford has had a hidden startup, or ""skunk works"" team, working internally on making a low-cost EV platform, he said.', 'This was music to the ears of Morgan Stanley’s\xa0Adam Jonas. The analyst has criticized Ford for using its profitable Ford Pro commercial business, which he dubbed Ford’s “Ferrari,” to subsidize its “EV science project.”', '“What matters for the Dearborn re-rating story? More efficient build-partner-buy decisions on Model e, where we see scope for Ford to leverage its strong relationships with Chinese EV partners who we think can give them the best chance,” Jonas wrote on Wednesday morning.', 'Farley didn’t say whether the Ford team would collaborate with its Chinese partners, only that they were a threat to the business. “All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs,” Farley said, adding that Ford’s “next Gen 2 products will be profitable in the first 12 months of their launch.”', 'Barclays analyst Dan Levy also liked Ford’s change in EV spending.', '“While the EV transition remains central for Ford, commentary on the call indicated some pivot on EV strategy for Ford — reflecting the broader market challenges in EV demand. Overall, Ford is pushing to be more mindful of capital requirements and vehicle economics,” Levy wrote.', 'The pivot to making a smaller EV poses a risk, however, Levy noted. “While there is a white space for this offering, this is a sharp contrast from Ford’s efforts to electrify with its leading franchises, and begging the question of what type of economics Ford could ultimately achieve with such a vehicle,” he said.', 'From a competition point of view, Tesla is the only Western-based automaker that makes EVs with a healthy profit margin. The thinking goes that Tesla is likely the only automaker (aside from Chinese rivals like BYD) that can make a cheap EV affordable. At least that’s the goal for Tesla and its upcoming $25,000 EV.', 'Whether Ford can accomplish its pivot — abandoning the middle market for EVs and going high-end with trucks and low-end with small EVs — is the risk investors in the long-term are making with Ford. But as Ford indicated, for the near term at least, the auto business will be strong based on the performance of its traditional gas-powered business and Ford Pro’s continued growth — now its most profitable business with $1.8 billion in EBIT last quarter alone.', 'Count Barclay’s Levy in the group that is happy to see Ford soldier on with its ICE (internal combustion engine) business, while the EV world sorts itself out.', '“While we believe an overhang remains on the EV transition for Ford and other legacy automakers, we nevertheless appreciate the near-term benefits of stronger ICE earnings,” Levy said.', 'For Ford and Farley, hopefully the profits from the ICE and Pro businesses can keep funding an EV transformation that’s seemingly evolving in real time.', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company's financial performance reflects its strategic market positioning and operational excellence, with a diverse range of products sold across various industries, including automotive, broadband communications, commercial aerospace, and more. Amphenol's financial tables reveal a company that is not only managing its current assets and liabilities effectively but also investing in growth opportunities and maintaining a healthy balance sheet to support its strategic initiatives."", ""Market Position and Diversified Portfolio: Amphenol Corp's strength lies in its second-largest global market share in the connector industry, a testament to its strong brand and innovative product range.

Additionally, the company's focus on high-performance interconnect systems and components means that it must continuously invest in R&D to maintain its competitive edge, which could strain resources if not managed effectively."", ""Operational Risks in Global Markets: Amphenol's extensive international operations expose it to risks associated with geopolitical tensions, trade policies, and economic instability. With a substantial portion of its workforce and sales outside the United States, the company must navigate complex regulatory environments and manage supply chain risks, which could impact operational efficiency and cost structures."", ""Technological Advancements and Market Growth: The ongoing evolution of technology, particularly in the automotive and IT datacom sectors, presents significant opportunities for Amphenol Corp.

Furthermore, the expansion of 5G networks and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning systems offer avenues for growth."", 'Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: Amphenol Corp has the opportunity to further solidify its market position through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. By acquiring complementary businesses or forming alliances, the company can expand its product offerings, enter new markets, and leverage synergies to enhance its competitive advantage.', ""Intense Competition and Technological Disruption: The interconnect and sensor markets are highly competitive, with constant pressure to innovate. Amphenol Corp faces the threat of technological disruption and must continually adapt to changing customer preferences and technological advancements. Competitors with more agile innovation processes or disruptive technologies could erode Amphenol's market share."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Challenges: Amphenol Corp operates in a regulatory environment that is becoming increasingly stringent, particularly concerning environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. Compliance with new regulations, such as those related to climate change and sustainability, could result in additional costs and operational challenges. Moreover, failure to meet these standards could damage the company's reputation and lead to financial penalties."", 'In conclusion, Amphenol Corp (NYSE:APH) exhibits a strong market position with a diversified product portfolio and global reach, which are central to its operational strengths. However, the company must address its reliance on specific markets and manage the risks associated with its international operations. Opportunities for growth are abundant, driven by technological advancements and potential strategic acquisitions. Nonetheless, Amphenol must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and regulatory challenges that pose threats to its business. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, while capitalizing on opportunities and mitigating threats, Amphenol Corp is well-positioned to navigate the dynamic landscape of the interconnect and sensor markets.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

295,9bc43a6f-8d74-326b-9157-83bc111247f4,NWSA,2024-02-09,Results: News Corporation Beat Earnings Expectations And Analysts Now Have New Forecasts,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-news-corporation-beat-earnings-105753533.html,1707476273,STORY,['NWSA'],"[""It's been a good week for News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest quarterly results, and the shares gained 4.6% to US$25.84. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$2.6b were what the analysts expected, News surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$0.27 per share, an impressive 47% above what was forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for News ', ""Taking into account the latest results, News' twelve analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be US$10.1b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to shoot up 72% to US$0.69. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$10.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.64 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on News' earnings potential following these results."", ""The analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 8.4% to US$29.20. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values News at US$36.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$22.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that News' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 2.1% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 0.9% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to see revenue growth of 3.3% annually. So it's clear that despite the acceleration in growth, News is expected to grow meaningfully slower than the industry average."", 'The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards News following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.', ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on News. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have forecasts for News going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for News that we have uncovered.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The filing indicates a revenue increase of $65 million, or 3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth is primarily attributed to the Digital Real Estate Services segment, with REA Group's higher Australian residential revenues, and the Dow Jones segment's increased professional information business revenues. However, the U.S. housing market's macroeconomic environment has adversely affected Move's revenues. The company's net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders also saw a significant rise to $156 million from $67 million in the prior year.

Nick?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter and our full year, and I'll provide my perspective on the results in our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials. The results for our fourth quarter represented that we believe, another period of forward progress. Again, we had opportunities and countered headwinds and the shape of the variated landscape changed as it regularly does. But in the end, we once again took advantage of the opportunities and overcame the turbulence.Sales in the quarter were $1,196.6 million or $1.2 billion, sounds better that way, up 3.5% as reported from last year, excluding $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency and $5.5 million from the recent Mountz acquisition. Organic sales increased 2.2%. The results represent a positive trend of some significance, demonstrating Snap-on's ability to adapt and to overcome market disruptions.From an earnings perspective, our opco operating income for the quarter was $257.9 million, and the OI margin for the quarter was $21.6 million up 10 basis points compared to last year. For Financial Services, operating earnings were $67.9 million, rising from the $63.9 million recorded last year. And the combination of the results from opco and from financial services offered an overall consolidated margin of 25.2%, also up 10 basis points. And the overall EPS was $4.75, a rise of 7.5% from the $4.42 that was registered a year ago.Now I talked about margins, let's turn to those markets and the trends we're seeing, based on our customer connections. We're with customers all the time. We believe automotive repair continues to be clearly favorable. Vehicle OEMs continue to see the need for upgrading dealer repair shops and enabling the shops and servicing the blizzard of new miles and technologies making the way to the market. And preparing for that future, OEM continue requiring dealership investments in new undercar equipment and essential tools to meet the challenge.It's a considerable opportunity at which Snap-on is clearly taking advantage. Activity in the independent shops is also robust. You can see it in the vehicle and repair macros, car parks. The car park is growing and getting older. Now over 12 years old on average. Cars are getting more complex and more difficult to fix and reflecting all of that, service hours are up, household spending on repair is growing, wages are rising. The number of technicians is moving upward fast and shop owners keep shouting, they want more technicians, even louder than they have over the past years.So the underlying repair business is strong. It's prospering. It was a reality that kept the tech positive even as the financial world was chanting over the past years and months, the recession is coming, the recession is coming. But cash isn't everything. Cash is in everything for the people of work. Personal confidence is a balance between your current environment, the garage we see and the way you see the world evolving in some time and sometime in the mid fall of last year, our franchisees sense that balance shifting negatively.In recent weeks, I've been around, I visited franchisees all over the country; in Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, and they all said about the same thing. The techs are cash rich but because of the external bad news of getting -- for breakfast almost every day, the impact in the Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, the dysfunction at the border and the uncertainty of the upcoming election, the weight of it all appears to be turning the tech's confidence poor. And when this happens, based on what we've seen in other times, we've seen it happen before, our customers keep purchasing, but they gravitate towards shorter payback items.And so it appeared to be as the quarter progressed. You saw that from mid to the end of the quarter. And so repair is strong, but the techs are worrying about the way forward, still cash rich, but they appear to be wavering in their confidence. This is a big change.Now let's move forward to critical industries. That's, of course, a bit different color. Confidence seems to be abundance across that business. This is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I plays. We continue to see progress. And the results in the quarter reflect that trend. It's a complex segment. A lot of you know this already, but I'm going to say it to set the context, it's a complex segment embedded with essential taps where the penalty for failure is high. It's an arena that demands precision, functionality and repeatability, all under the most grueling environments, covering a vast range of applications from the sensitive micro world of chip manufacturing to giant or rugged earthmoving equipment to performance critical aviation, even up to spaceships.The underlying need for customization -- but in that segment, the underlying need for customization and precision, both Snap-on strength is clearly growing all across those sectors. C&I is also the most geographically dispersed operations. And there's significant variations from country to country and created by the uncertainties in the economic political policies. As such, we see mixed results in Europe and a continuing but slow recovery in Asia. We also see differences from sector to sector with education, aviation and the military and general industries all showing nice improvements where natural resources and heavy-duty are off.But shining through all that variability is our expanding strength in those critical industries. The advantage Snap-on holds in product and brand and in people. And in the quarter, those drivers were on display. So across our corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, turbulent from period to period and from sector to sector, but filled with ongoing opportunity. And we believe we're well positioned to face the challenges of today, those at the end of today and those that may arise in the future. We remain confident that we have the continuing potential along -- we have continuing potential along our run rates for growth, and we see significant power to overcome rooted in our Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, especially customer connection. One of our substantial competitive advantages is being right where the actual paths are being pursued and in engineering the products to make the work easier by matching those insights -- the insights gained with technology applied.We've seen that over time, we've seen that innovative offerings create the path to advance and to overcome any turbulence. And in the quarter and in the year, our product line continued to advance, just kept getting stronger. And we continue to invest in Snap-on value creation to make that possible. We believe, in fact, that our product line has never been stronger. And despite the turbulence, we had more million dollar hit products in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2023 than ever before. and we believe we'll move higher again in 2024.Now let's talk about the full year, the 2023 performance. Sales of $4.7302 billion represented an increase of 5.3% as reported and arrived at 5.6% organically. Opco OI exceeded $1 billion. I'd say that again, $1 billion for the first time reaching $1.399 billion and our opco OI margin of 22% -- 22% represented an average increase, an increase of 110 basis points at gangbusters. We've never been at 22% and 110 is a great increase. And when we include financial services earnings of $270.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation year was 25.7%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share with the year were $18.76, rising $1.94 or 11.5%. We believe these are good numbers.Now for an individual -- for the individual operating -- now for the individual operating group. So let's start with C&I. Reported sales for the C&I group in the quarter were $363.9 million, up $20.7 million or 6%. That includes $5.5 million from the Mountz acquisition, $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency and our organic sales increase of $11.6 million or 3.3%. They all reflecting the strength in critical industries, partially offset by a slide in automotive power tools. C&I's operating income for the period was $54.1 million. It was up 12.9% and the OI margin was 14.9%, rising 90 basis points and overcoming 50 basis points of headwind associated with negative currency.Again -- again, in this case, the advance was driven by strong expansion in critical industries. And our increased kitting capacity for complex orders continue to play a large role in that progress, but significant advances also spurred as it regularly is by new product. Innovations like our recently launched automated tool control or ATC portal, it's the latest addition to our unique Snap-on ATC tool control product lineup. It's manufactured at our AutoCrib operations -- acquisition operation -- operation that was recently acquired in California, and the portal significantly extends the reach of our ATC systems. It enables efficient control over a much wider range of device shapes and sizes. In effect, this portal's a doorway, in line with radio frequency identification or RFID antenna, and it's typically a placed at the entrance to a tool room. Significant assets like hydraulic pumps, portable generators and valuable diagnostic equipment are often stored in common areas in factories or other places and entered in a catalog by fixing an RFID tag. As technicians scan the badges to enter and exit the portal, the system documents the devices moving in and out of the secured storage, keeping close track of these critical items, just like the base ATC system keeps track of hand and power tools moving in and out of the tool storage box, but over a much wider set of areas. We anticipate that the new portal will be a big boost and a great opportunity for C&I in the growing area of tool control, a very important area for us. And in the fourth quarter, we saw some of that potential come to bear. So C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds but clear and overall advancement, great momentum enabled by capacity expansion and by growing product power.Now to the Tools Group. The Tools Group quarter, not at our standard. But we do see a path forward adjusting to the changing environment. As you may remember, this is where we sell to the tech. Those who toil the wrenches, punch the touchscreen and those who appear to be wavering in macro confidence and those customers who under these conditions shift to lower payback or quicker payback items. While the fourth quarter reflects our franchisees and the Tools Group pivoting to match that movement, that customer movement. Sales in the quarter were $513.3 million included in our -- and they included an organic decrease of 5.7% compared to last year. Now more to our standard, group OI margins were 21.6%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 10 basis points of negative currency and the gross margin percentage rose to 200 basis points. Nice gains. As the quarter played out, the franchisee sense the change and redirected their ordering and selling focus to match the customer shifts to lower -- to faster payback items. And Snap-on is doing the same, defining a way forward, redirecting factory capacity, adopting smaller ticket marketing focus and launching innovative or quicker payback products that fit the environment. State-of-the-art designs, like our new ratchet, forged manufacturer at Elizabeth, Tennessee factory. This next evolution in our ratchet line is 100-tooth design. We've named the [Synergy] series. We believe it's a game changer for technicians, a significant improvement that helps make repair work much easier.The Synergy is a short payback item that will make a clear difference right away, a 15% thinner head, an inch longer handle a 3.5-inch degree swing area, 20% more compact, all for easier access and quicker work in tight corners that they also come up like chassis areas in modern vehicles. [Synergy's] internal mechanisms were reengineered to engage the primary drag with 10 contact points versus the 7 in the previous design, greatly reducing the chance of slippage, improving the tools reliability and quality even while under maximum loads. Technicians may be uncertain about the way forward, but they're confident about the Synergy . They know with the Synergy -- They know it will provide a quick payback. It's thinner, longer, stronger. And going forward, we'll expand that new technology -- the new 100-tooth technology throughout the Snap-on lineup, and we believe it will quickly become a must-have all across the industry.Also in the quarter, our Algona, Iowa manufacturing facility to reach the new quick payback, KRSC2430, a 36-inch deluxe shop cart with its with smooth mobility and a substantial payload. It offers a technician economic an attractive way to start the tools but it also allows them to position their instruments adjacent to the workplace, increasing productivity, eliminating the time walking to and from the job. As a particularly special feature, the reversal lid on this cart serves as a durable workbench when open separates into 2 sections, showing full and easy -- allowing full and easy access to the deep 8-inch top compartment that's underneath. The unit also includes a complete power strip where technicians charge their cordless tools, diagnostic platforms, lights and other electronic devices.The innovative cards also configured with 2 additional drawers. There's kind of 2 additional drawers underneath the sliding top, providing quick accessibility for essential and small items, preventing lost times from treasure hunting and large drawers for small-scale items. And it's a common problem with other units. And so this will really save time for the tech. And like our top-of-the-line tool storage boxes, technicians can customize their cart, selecting from an array of colors and trims and so they can project their own personal identity throughout the shop. The KRSC2430 economical storage, attractive features convenient mobility, we expect it will have strong and continuing to appeal in this uncertain environment. And shifting the product focus also requires some repositioning in the factory, expanding the capacity to match customer preference, we're doing just that, moving to currently popular items, more dedication to short payback to products like our Flex and Swivel sockets and the new long nose pliers and Milwaukee, additional cart welding, breaking bottlenecks for our economical storage cart options in Algona and doubling down on Synergy production in Elizabeth, Tennessee.Finally, our sales teams are being deployed to help franchisees, giving them added energy and more time in selling shorter payback items off their truck. Well, that's the Tools Group. Shifting tech preferences, pivoting operations to ensure the way forward, adapting products, capacity and sales focus, making the most of our strengths in the turbulence.Now for RS&I. The group results confirmed what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, dealers and independents and keeping pace with the growing complexity of the car park. RS&I sales in the quarter were $450.8 million, up $12.9 million versus last year, including an organic sales rise of $8.8 million that was authored by volume with vehicle OEM programs for new models and platforms and by strong progress in undercar for both dealerships and independent shops, gains that served to offset the decrease in the big-ticket diagnostic items. RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $113.3 million, and the operating margin was a still strong 25.1% but down 20 basis points, reflecting the mix shift to lower-margin undercar and OEM facing and the OEM-facing activities.But just like other segments, RS&I advances are driven by new products. And even the aging car park is filled with diverse and ever-changing models. Light-duty trucks and full-size SUVs are bigger than ever requiring a range of wheel configurations and sizes somewhere over 100 pounds. And at the recent repair industry, SEMA show in Las Vegas, we had one of our answers to that challenge on prominent display. Our new automated armored series wheeler balancers, specifically designed for high-volume shops that require precision and reliability made from robust steel for enhanced and rugged durability.Even a small compact footprint, the balancers intelligent operating system uses sonar technologies to automatically measure both the wheel and RIM, eliminating the need for manual intervention, a great time saver in the shop. And for improved safety, the unit also includes heavy-duty pneumatic for us that positions cumbersome tires on the spindle, making it unnecessary, protects and physically lift or manipulate the heavy assembly, substantially avoiding is the strain. The balancer also includes a high resolution touch screen and an intuitive interface and an effective ergonomic design. It's a powerful combination of accuracy, speed, durability and safety and the SEMA crowd clearly noticed.So that's RS&I. Shop repair remains robust. Vehicle complexity continues to advance abundant opportunities for a great future. The group has abundant opportunities for a great future and our RS&I team has the products to take advantage. Well, that's our quarter and our year. For the quarter, sales up 3.5% as reported, 2.2% organically. OI margin reached 21.6%, up 10 basis points, and the EPS was $4.75, rising 7.5% and against the turbulence.The period was marked by extraordinary positives in the critical industry -- in the critical industries that are C&I. The Tools Group not reaching our standard, but displaying margin gains and pivoting to match the technician shifting focus and RS&I, enabling both dealerships and independent shops to meet the challenges of higher complexity in new technologies and the full year 2023 sales of $4.7302 billion, up 5.6% organically, an OI of over $1 billion rising 10.5% and OI margin of 22%, an increase of 110 basis points -- 110 basis points, we like that. And EPS of $18.76, up $1.94 or 11.5%. It was another encouraging year. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"", 'Aldo J. Pagliari', ""Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.1966 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 3.5% from 2022 levels reflecting a 2.2% organic sales gain, $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales were strong in our businesses serving critical industries this quarter while activity in our automotive repair market was mixed. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 48.5% last year.Benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by the effects of a higher mix of lower sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points to 26.7% from 27% last year, primarily due to lower corporate expenses and benefits from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased investment in personnel and other costs.Operating earnings before financial services of $257.9 million in the quarter compared to $248 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 21.5% last year. Financial services revenue of $97.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $88.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $325.8 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.2% compared to 25.1% in 2022.Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.4% compared to 22% last year, while our full year 2023 tax rate of 22.5% compared to 22.8% last year. Net earnings of $255.3 million or $4.75 per diluted share reflected an increase of $16.4 million or $0.33 per share from '22 levels and represented a 7.5% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share.Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $363.9 million increased from $343.2 million last year, reflecting an $11.6 million or 3.3% and organic sales gain, $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries partially offset by a double-digit decline in sales of power tools.With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. As previously announced, during the quarter, Snap-on acquired Mountz Inc., a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of high-precision torque tools. The acquisition complements and expands Snap-on's torque offering for a variety of critical industry applications. The operating results of Mountz are reported within the C&I group.Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 39.2% in the fourth quarter from 37.7% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector pricing actions, savings from RCI initiatives and the 30 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 24.3% in the quarter from 23.7% in 2022, primarily due to a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions as well as from investments in personnel and other costs.Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $54.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $47.9 million last year. The operating margin of 14.9%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects compared to 14% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 90 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $513.3 million compared to $542.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline partially offset by $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in the U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain in our international operations.Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 45.2% in the quarter from 43.2% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products which includes lower sales of items where the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products made by our C&I and RS&I groups. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 180 basis points to 23.6% in the quarter from 21.8% in 2022, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $111 million compared to $116.1 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 21.4% in 2022.Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $450.8 million compared to $437.9 million in 2022, reflecting a 2% organic sales gain and $4.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. These gains were partially offset by a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin was unchanged from last year with benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives, offset by increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 20 basis points to 19.9% from 19.7% last year. primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $113.3 million compared to $110.6 million last year. The operating margin of 25.1% and compared to 25.3% reported last year.Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $8.9 million to $97.2 million from $88.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services and operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. The Financial services expenses were up $4.9 million from 2022 levels, including $3.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision.For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 8.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.8% and 17.6%. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $33.1 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $3.4 million or 1.1% from 2022 levels.Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit was up from 1.6% in 2022, but was the same as in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 30 basis points, reflecting the seasonal uptick we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million represented 2.59% of outstandings at quarter end, which compares to 2.51% as reported at the end of last quarter.Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $296.9 million in the quarter represented 114% of net earnings and compared to $210.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory in 2023 as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $104.6 million included $42.6 million for acquisitions, net additions to finance receivables of $42.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $149 million included cash dividends of $98 million and the repurchase of 217,000 shares of common stock for $60.9 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of year-end, we had approximately $22.9 million of common stock under our existing authorizations available for repurchase. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $29.6 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year-end. Inventories decreased $27.2 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. Our year-end cash position of $1.15 billion compared to $757.2 million a year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 3.8% compared to 9% a at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance, and I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. We expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on fourth quarter and full year. Geographic variation, shifting customer perspective, growing macro uncertainties, all overcome by Snap-on's ability to wield disadvantages making the most of opportunities, continuing its positive and upward trend now demonstrated over multiple quarters and a significant number of years. The quarter did see the change in technicians perspective. And in pivoting with just the Tools Group volume did not meet our standards, but the tools team did blunt the difficulty with favorable mix and RCI driving improvement of OI margins up 20 basis points with the gross margin rising 200 basis points. The story with repair shop owners and managers was somewhat different. They recognize the need to upgrade and RS&I increase this rise in participation in OEM programs and extended its gains in undercar equipment, particularly in the expanding collision space.And finally, we saw C&I register another quarter of increasing importance to the corporation with the critical industries rising double digits and achieving another leap in margin reaching new margins -- reaching new and significant levels. And it all resulted in a fourth quarter advancement against some substantial headwinds. Sales were up 3.5% as reported 2.2% organically. OI margins of 21.6% increased 10 basis points and an EPS of $4.75 rising 7.5%, all representing progress and a time when all was not where we'd like it to be.But I believe the bright-line story in this period is the full year sales for the corporation increased 5.6% organically. Opco OI margin rose 110 basis points, another significant advance and a long line of gain reaching 22% for the first time, and the EPS was $18.76 up versus all comparisons. And it was all offered by some noteworthy performance of the Tools Group, not encountering the smoothest sailing but still achieving an OI margin of 23.6%, an increase of 150 basis points. RS&I, sales up 6.7% organically and an OI margin of 24.3%, up 70 basis points off a strong base. And C&I, facing a landscape of challenges. We're growing 4.2% as reported 5% organically with an OI margin of 15.5%, up 140 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. And perhaps the biggest story of all is the emergence of the critical industry business, growing strong double digits in all 4 quarters demonstrating that we really can roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage at considerable margins. We see the quarter in the year as demonstrating that Snap-on does have multiple run rates for progress. And if one of our segments is challenged, we can still move forward achieving clear and continuing advancement driven by the other parts of the enterprise.And as such, we're encouraged by our presence and by our future. We believe that with our advantages in product, everyone recognizes we know work and we do make tasks easier. In brand, everywhere you go, among the -- everywhere you go in the people of work, the Snap-on sign is displayed and spoken up with great pride. And in our people, a team, battle tested, who find the way forward and upwards despite the challenges, the results of 2023 say it so. And we believe, enabled by those advantages, Snap-on will overcome, we'll achieve and will advance continuing the positive trend throughout 2024 and well beyond.Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll address our franchisees and associates. I know they're all listening. I've spoken today with belief and confidence on our current situation on our way forward. I do so principally -- but I do so principally because I know the capability and the quality demonstrated over and over by all of you. For your contributions and authoring our achievements, you have my congratulations. For the skills and energy you bring to our corporation every day, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you consistently display for the future of our mutual enterprise, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Luke Junk with Baird.', 'Luke L. Junk', ""Nick, for starters, I was hoping you could just expand. I know you mentioned some of these things in the prepared remarks already, but if you could just expand on Snap-on's most important growth drivers in the Tools Group as we go into 2024 here, really irrespective of what the market is giving you? And if you pivot aggressively enough, do you think that you can grow the tools business this year?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""Yes, I think we can. I mean, I think we've done it. We did it. We did it in the pandemic era coming out of the pandemic when -- when confidence was kind of still in the tools. If you look at the first 4 quarters after the pandemic, it was mostly on shorter payback items. So we can make a good business out of that. We made it at the tail end of the financial recession as well. So we think that's the capability. We are simply -- as you might say, what we saw coming out of the SFC, everybody was sort of business as usual, pumped up and they were ordering to a general mix of product.And then on late October and November, things started to look a little different to our franchisees, and they wanted to make a pivot because they had been through this rodeo before, and so they wanted to redirect. That's what we're doing. We think we have great things in hand tools and in diagnostics and in tool storage carts and maybe some of the lower lines of tool storage boxes themselves like at the classic series. So we're going to focus on that. That doesn't mean we're going to abandon the bigger ticket items, things like maybe TRITON and so on in diagnostics or -- which we believe is very strong, but -- or our boxes. But we're going to shift our focus. And it's important to talk about the capacity, Luke, because remember, we were already kind of bumping up the capacity, and we're fighting to expand it. And so what you want to do in this situation is try to use that expanded capacity in a redirected manner. So we actually have the volumes in the places we think are selling now.So we feel pretty good about that. Our product lineup is good. We've got a good -- as I said, product leads the way. We've got a great array of hand tools coming forward. We got new tool boxes, diagnostics, power tools, all those things are going to work for us, we believe. So the way forward is, one, continue to drive the products, make sure we can actually deliver them.And then thirdly, as always, to try to help the franchisees in selling giving them more time to sell and maybe sometimes it might take a little longer in this situation. So that's why we're deploying our field guys to get out there and provide a little bit more energy and time to the actual selling process. So we think it's a reasonable pivot. This is -- again, it's not our first rodeo. It's not the Tools Group's first rodeo. So we think, okay, things have changed a little bit. We know how to respond."", 'Luke L. Junk', ""And then I guess a related question would be the shift in mechanic sentiments that you saw mid fall. Just -- how do you think that influences the appetite for credit here and as you tracked either originations or just other trends in [book] I'm thinking more from the demand side, Nick?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""Wow, yes, you probably see less credit use in that situation. I mean, the originations were -- I think that will set down 1% in the United States in the quarter. So I mean, I think you see that kind of thing. And if you go back and you look at our numbers, say, coming out of COVID, let's say, quarter 3 and 4 of '20 and first second quarter of 2021, you'll see that kind of phenomenon. So that could be the case.Now this is early days for this. Our people sense it. Well, the good thing about this is our people sensed it right away. And so sensing it, they changed their words that put a little strain on a factory because when you change the orders, it makes the capacity shrink a little bit. So you have those kinds of things. So I believe you may see a little pivoting away from that.Now I think this is right in tune with everything. I do believe, I've said it many times that there is a kind of bifurcated economy that there's a financial economy, the kinds of people that I said in my -- my talk that -- my remarks that we're talking about the recession is coming, the recession is coming and the people are saying we're going to have a soft landing now. But the people at the grassroot level have a different view of the world. And if you look at the Wall Street Journal, the front page say and the paper edition, there's an article saying just this.Actually, I met a bunch of franchisees, and I met a huge number of people in the factories and in garages in places like Conway and Louisville and Elizabeth in Tennessee and Milwaukee. So and they all kind of say the same thing. They got jobs. They got the cash coming in. But every day they get up and get bad news for breakfast. And you start to wonder about what's going to happen. So it's not that things are bad today but people worry about how things are going to happen and what's going to happen in the future. And I think all of us looking at the events might say that's true."", 'Luke L. Junk', ""Okay. And then maybe a final question. This one might be for Aldo. Just hoping on what happened in the car tools business, specifically this quarter, if we look at the intersegment so it seems like things maybe step down quite a bit. I'm just trying to reconcile what you saw in order trends versus your impression of underlying trends in power tools. Is it possible that there is sort of a onetime adjustment in orders to level set inventory on the bans in power tools. Am I thinking about that right?"", 'Aldo J. Pagliari', ""So in some ways, there's another buffer stock in between the Tools Group maintained its own levels of inventory. So you're right, simply the Tools Group had less need to buy as much in power tools and diagnostics in the quarter. It doesn't mean necessarily that flows one to one through the demand because you have inventories in between, both inventories at demand itself and the inventories in the hands of the Tools Group. But you have lower sales from C&I and from RS&I to the Tools Group, reflects actually pretty much power tools and diagnostic-related products."", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""Actually, yes, I'd offer that -- what you're seeing a phenomenon as you're seeing, as Aldo said, some adjustment there. And if you look at -- if you actually look at careful -- look at C&I, you see they actually had a powerful quarter to their traditional customers. But what happens in the power tools business is our new CT9038 came out 18 volt, it sold great, then this happened. And that kept selling -- but the bigger ticket items in power tools, like the 18 volts just kind of dropped off and people tended to want the 14.4 volt. Our supply chains are a little longer for that. We couldn't supply all of that. So you have that kind of situation. But if you look at the Tools Group level, power tools are not down, especially an outstanding amount. It's mostly between the Tools Group and C&I."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.', 'Patrick Neil Buckley', 'This is Patrick Buckley on for Bret. Could you talk a bit more on pricing versus units within the Tools Group. And then looking ahead, are pricing actions on the table here? Or is it more focused on pushing the shorter payable tools?', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""No. Pricing, we generally have -- except in inflationary -- exceptional inflationary times, which we've all been through more or less recently is we get 30 to 40 basis points of pricing, something like that. Most of our advancement comes from RCI and new product, which gets its margins. We get our margins for new products. We don't plan changing that approach. We're not really going to make a major adjustment in pricing going forward. This is more about shorter payback versus longer payback.It's the -- think of it this way. it's just take a simple thing as a tool storage unit. Okay, you can buy a big epic and boy, they are great. People love them. They bring people up and show them their box, and they say, this is my dream, but that's not a quick payback. That's a longer payback. You got to work a long time and get efficiency from the size of that and the features in that to get a payback. But if you get yourself a cart, you can move from your workplace out into the shop -- particularly in some of these independent shops out into the shop yard or all over the shop.And that gives you immediate savings in time just there. And so that's the kind of thing I'm talking about is that shift to the idea. Is this thing going to pay for me right away, pay me back right away. Wrenches do that, particularly like the [Synergy] I talked about here, which is a leap forward in terms of reliability and access and swing arc and make the jobs easier and able to beat the flat rate faster. So those are the kinds of things we're betting on. We've seen it work before. So I think the good thing about this is Tools Group saw it started to move on."", 'Patrick Neil Buckley', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then was there anything notable to call out in the corporate expense line and Q4 seemed to take a step down from the run rate we saw in the past few years?"", 'Aldo J. Pagliari', 'So we had lower spending in the quarter on legal expenses in particular. We had a favorable settlement on a matter. So it was able to reduce our expenditures in the quarter. But the run rate for corporate expenses is running in a typical fashion.', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""Actually, in total, it's about $113 million. It's $113 million in the year. That's up $5 million to $6 million year-over-year."", 'Aldo J. Pagliari', '$113 million versus $1.08 million.', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', 'Yes, yes.', 'Operator', 'Next question is from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM.', 'Scott Lewis Stember', 'Nick, could you split out the different subsegments within tools, hand tools, power tools, obviously, sounds like power tools were down, but -- and the storage units, things like that?', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""(inaudible) it's not about good news to go around. The big kahuna moving downwards was diagnostics. They saw it diagnostics, and we have several ranges of diagnostics and the latest introduced was the SOLUS -- it's the low end of -- I don't want to say low end, it's the lowest priced version of our product. And that pay in the quarter, not as well as we might have hoped in our situations. But what kind of went down was ZEUS, the top of the line and the next one down to TRITON. And ZEUS had been introduced last year in the fourth quarter, so those comparisons around. But the biggest kahuna down was that. And then after that, I think actually tool storage is up slightly, but all because of carts, pretty much because of carts and shop and tech were down. So hand tools were down some.But if you looked at it, the thing that -- one of the things that drove the margins, I think the important point out of that, Scott, what drove the margin improvement in the Tools Group despite the lower volume was that the stuff they make, the carts at Algona, the tool storage items and the hand tools were a bigger portion of their sales than in prior year -- in the prior year. And so that wielded a much greater mix because from -- in hands tools -- what the tools group sells for hand tools and tool storage, they get both distribution and manufacturer margins for things like diagnostics and power tools and shopping tech stuff, they only get the distribution margin. So there's a pretty big difference between those. So you can get some pretty good news or bad news depending on how that mix works."", 'Scott Lewis Stember', ""So going forward, obviously, you're focusing on quicker payback items. So obviously, that would be hand tools? You're going to start cranking that up a little bit more?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""We would say it this way. I mean there's -- we like to think, Scott, that we could find quicker payback items than everything. Hand tools clearly -- mostly often -- I should say often, our quick payback. The technicians can see quick payback. Certain versions of tool storage, as I've said, the carts in particular, which tend to be substantially cheaper and more efficacious because they're kind of an option to add on to a big box. And then or somebody can't afford a lot and wants to just get a Snap-on tool storage in some way at an affordable level. And then the lower end of that product, the classic series, which we're working on having in terms of in terms of programs coming up, which we've got scheduled for February and March. And so that would be the case. Diagnostics, it all tends to be bigger ticket items. So there are -- there is the SOLUS at the lower end, and we have some -- we'll bring out a new diagnostic at some point during the year, which creates interest. But the lower ticket items is just at the bottom end of diagnostics. And then power tools can have I don't want to say big ticket items, but the 18 volts are a little more expensive. 14.4 volt is a lot more affordable and you tend to have a very focused application for where the 18 volt tends to be broader applications to bring that power to any place whereas the 18 -- the 14 volts tend to be saying, I got this problem in this particular chassis area of the car I see, so I'm going to use that 14.4 volt. So that tends to be quick payback as well. Those are the kinds of things you see."", 'Scott Lewis Stember', ""Got it. And then just a last question on the bigger picture. You said that the overall market, the underlying conditions look pretty strong. You're not seeing any warning signs for the businesses themselves, demand. I mean O'Reilly reported last night, and they said that their the professional business was up double digits. So I just want to make sure that we're not -- this is not a canary in the coal mine that the underlying business..."", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""I don't think so. I mean I think everybody says the business is good. I mean, I don't know. First of all, I have 2 answers to that. One is the metrics. If you look at the BOL data, that all seems positive. I mean the miles driven are up in that. It's a long way thing. But the spending on -- household spending on repair up 4% year-over-year. That's a pretty good number. The number of techs up 4.5%, i.e., used to be 1%. They're growing at 4.5%. The technician wage is up 7%.So those kinds of things are good things and the car park, of course, keeps growing, and so they keep pumping it in. And the auto industry, while this doesn't make a difference too much is starting to come back, and they're still rolling out those new technologies.So all that seems to be from a quantitative point of view seems to be positive. Now the Bureau labor data can trail, so I don't know, and people have questions about that. But then when you go out in the windshield survey and you talk to not only the people our franchisees who are out there every day, but to talk to the general people who work, they think cash is rolling for them. They're not going to say they're cash rich, but they are. And so I think things look good right now. And I don't expect this to change."", 'Scott Lewis Stember', 'Got it. And just to firm up a follow-up on something you said earlier, you would not be surprised to see the Tools Group return to positive organic growth?', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""No, we don't give guidance. But I think I said like 4 times in my remarks, they weren't at standard. We expect them to grow. If we don't, if we don't grow, they will be below our expectations."", 'Operator', 'And our last question today comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.', 'David Sutherland MacGregor', ""Let me just start by sort of picking up on the last line of questioning. It sounds like hand tools and storage is doing maybe a little bit better in relative terms. But that's also where you were adding capacity in Elizabeth and in Milwaukee and Algona. Are they doing a little bit better because you finally just have a little more capacity and you're able to liquidate some of that backlog? Or is there may be a better underlying demand story in those categories?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""That's a complicated question because of the situation, I mean, I guess, I don't know. I think this way, though, I'm pretty sure we're doing better because we had in the Q some ability to adjust for shorter payback items in those areas. That's pretty much the way I can answer it.Now what I will tell you is, David, this is an operating guys song is that when you're thinking that you're going to have -- you're going to have promotions rolling out of your factories and all of a sudden, your customers come up and say, never mind, we want to go over here. This tends to create a lot of, shall I say, inefficiencies. And so you have to adjust to that.So I don't think we got the full result the capacities -- we had hoped the capacity expansions, we had hoped to get in the fourth quarter because of those changes, they just optimize what you've added. And so that's part of -- that's a factor in all of this. Yes, the backlog for -- some of the backlog for tool storage was down. So we liquidated some of that, but we still have backlog in those areas. So it's a complicated answer, I think. You might have some of that. But on the other hand, we couldn't fulfill it as much. We couldn't have liquidated as much as we would have -- had we had full -- had been able to roll in the way we had planned to roll in our production plans coming out of the SFC."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', 'Okay. Just a couple of other questions for you, Nick and Aldo, the trucks, I would love to get your sense if your organic growth was down 5.7%. What do you think the truck sell-through was?', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""I sort of know what it was, and it was better than that in the quarter and for the year, generally is better. This all tends to come out in the (inaudible) though. -- in the long run. But in the fourth quarter, the trucks were not down. We're substantially -- they were still down, but not anything like the Tools Group."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', 'Down low single digits?', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""Yes. Sure. I mean so you would say maybe the -- you don't know, but they've kind of liquidated some things. So part of it is delivery -- if you pick a particular product and you say a shift to that product, we do have inventory, but the point is sometimes you don't have that product and you have to make changes in the factory, sometimes we couldn't even deliver what they wanted."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', 'Let me just shift to credit for a second, if I could. And Aldo, you normally share the breakdown on originations between finance receivables and credit receivables. Would you be kind enough to do that for us again this quarter?', 'Aldo J. Pagliari', 'EC receivables, the originations were down, and that was more than offset by contract receivables. And similar to the results of the Tools Group, EC originations in the United States were down more than what we saw internationally. It was actually up in terms of EC originations. So that kind of gives you some of the blend.', 'David Sutherland MacGregor', 'Okay. And I guess within those origination numbers, can you distinguish between merchandise versus franchisees flipping RA and EC?', 'Aldo J. Pagliari', ""Actually, I was pleased to say, I know you're asking, David, actually, in the quarter, there's less than what would be the typical mix of what we call transfers, RA transfers where they transfer items from the revolving accounts over to EC. There's actually less of an effect of that. But for the full year, it's very consistent with where we expect it to be. So there's been no signs of franchisees using the credit company to finance their operations by moving things from their revolving accounts across I think that's what you're after."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', ""Yes. And do you get a sense that there's an opportunity here to maybe I mean, you've got a very high-quality credit portfolio. I don't think that's ever been a doubt. Certainly -- certainly, that's our sense. Do you get a sense there's maybe an opportunity here to relax a little on the credit standard in order to reinvigorate demand?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', 'No.', 'David Sutherland MacGregor', 'It was a nice tidy answer, Nick.', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', 'Well, if that was me.', 'Aldo J. Pagliari', ""If you think about what we said, people are lacking confidence to some degree for big-ticket items. I don't think the way hold is to discount the interest rate you're going to charge those to provoke a sale. So we're not into the -- discounting isn't usually our style. It doesn't mean we might not come up with creative promotions and bundling and things like that. But I don't think discounting is the way home."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', ""And so what's the take on the regional kickoffs? Just help us think through first half that you're seeing in regional kickoff..."", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""I think we usually comment on the kickoffs usually in the first quarter call. But in general, and we tried to shift the kickoff at the last moment for -- we took a different approach to kickoffs this time. We saw this problem. We try to concentrate on shorter payback items that seemed to go reasonably okay with those items. And then we established a little more program in February and March, thinking that if we kind of stretch the kickoffs into other months, then we would be able to have better adjustments to the current situation.So that's sort of what we did in the kickoff. I was at one in Las Vegas and -- yes, they usually send me the Deadwood South -- North Dakota. This time, I got to go to Las Vegas. And we had the Canadian guys there. That seemed to go okay. They seem to be positive. The franchisees don't seem to be daunted by this. They just report what they see."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', ""Right. The last question for me is just maybe on the competitive dynamics. You've been fairly steady in terms of the number of trucks you have on the road now for quite a number of years. I guess, maybe there's a few more company-owned versus franchise owned within the mix overall. But at the same time, your competitors have been increasing the number of trucks on the road. You sense this is starting to have a little bit of an impact on it. Do you feel like maybe there was a little bit of share loss this quarter versus some of your peers?"", 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""I don't know. I don't like to -- I never like to talk about share. I never talked about share when our numbers were booming upwards, and I don't talk about it now. You could think that, but I don't think so. I think, look, we got -- we have -- I don't think -- I think we're covering the universe with the 3,400-or-so franchisees that we have. So you could argue that some locations might be seeing competition where they haven't. But there are a few locations, David, that don't have any competition. So what does happen sometimes is tough, okay, somebody 1 or 2 or 3. One of the other competitors will put somebody in place. But that guy, our guy in that territory has already been dealing with people and the other guy has its own competition and it might create more business. But I never know the franchisees saying that. Why you -- logically might think that would be the case, and we think about it all the time, and I ask the question all the time, but they almost never say that. In fact, never."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', 'Are you seeing any change in franchisee attrition rates?', 'Nicholas T. Pinchuk', ""No, that's pretty held the same, pretty much the same in the quarter. So franchisees, just in the quarter, we saw more -- I think we saw more longer than the tooth guys leave in the quarter, an interesting phenomenon. But that was -- that's just a sort of anecdotal view of it. I don't -- not sure that could make some difference, but I don't think we worry about that in particular in terms of the day-to-day dynamics of the competition."", 'Operator', 'This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks.', 'Sara M. Verbsky', 'Thank you all for joining us today.

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO."", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we delivered a strong holiday quarter, achieving record second quarter revenue and earnings per share with growth outpacing expectations. Importantly, we advanced our strategic agenda, driving consistent progress through the power of brand building, customer centricity and disciplined execution. I want to recognize our talented global teams whose creativity, passion and agility continue to fuel consumer engagement and our standout financial results. Touching on the highlights for the quarter. First, we powered global growth to achieve a 3% sales gain, demonstrating the benefits of our diversified business model. This increase was driven by 12% growth at constant currency internationally, which included 19% growth in Greater China, consistent with our expectations. Further, sales to Chinese consumers globally grew at a mid-teens rate, which included continued growth with Chinese tourists. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our brands, leveraging Tapestry's established platform in the region to build our business not only in China but with this important cohort worldwide. Turning to Japan. Revenue rose 6%. And in Other Asia and Europe, sales increased 9% and 11%, respectively, with each delivering strong growth against last year's double-digit gains. Finally, in North America, we delivered revenue in line with last year and better than our expectations. We are continuing to drive a healthy business, underscored by significant gross and operating margin expansion compared to last year and plan. Second, we remain focused on building customer engagement across our brands. In the quarter, we acquired approximately 2.5 million new customers in North America alone, of which roughly half were Gen Z and millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands. And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, demonstrating our ability to engage with our existing customer base while bringing new customers to our brands. Third, we delivered unique and seamless Omnichannel experiences, reinforcing the benefits of our data-rich, direct-to-consumer operating model. To this end, we drove mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis, both in stores and online as we continue to meet our customers where they choose to shop. Our exceptional retail teams welcome more customers to our stores around the world, while we maintained our strong positioning in digital, which represented 1/3 of revenue. During the quarter, we were proud to open a new multi-brand fulfillment center in Las Vegas as we continue to invest in our Omnichannel capabilities, supporting speed, sustainability and growth. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence by delivering compelling newness and value to consumers, which supported overall handbag AUR gains globally. At the same time, we drove growth in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, important for the holiday gifting season. Overall, we generated record second quarter EPS, which exceeded expectations and increased significantly compared to the prior year, highlighting the power of brand building and disciplined execution. We achieved these strong results while making strategic investments in our brands to accelerate future growth. Now turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. We delivered another standout quarter as our team continues to fuel brand desire by bringing expressive luxury to life, a positioning that is relevant and unique to Coach. Our strategy supported by consistent execution are driving strong innovation, consumer connections and financial results, highlighted by revenue growth across geographies and significant margin expansion. Now touching on some details of the second quarter. We achieved growth in our leather goods offering fueled by our iconic platforms. Tabby, again, outperformed expectations, nearly doubling versus last year and over-indexing with new and younger consumers at above-average AUR. We're continuing to bring newness to this iconic family across bags and small leather goods, including the recently launched Quilted Tabby with further runway ahead. At the same time, we drove growth across the balance of the assortment anchored by our Willow and Rogue families, which remain foundational volume drivers. We also drove momentum with the recently introduced Idol Family, expanding the offering with new sizes. Overall, our creative and innovative products supported a mid-single-digit gain in global handbag AUR including growth in North America. Looking forward, we see continued opportunity for pricing improvements given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. At the same time, we fueled gains in lifestyle as we focus on building the brand's reach with consumers with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately, customer lifetime value. In ready-to-wear, we advanced our strategy to build a core assortment of key styles that represent compelling value. Growth in the quarter was driven by outerwear. In footwear, the Leah Loafer continued to outperform. And in men's leather goods, growth was driven by success in the key Gotham, Charter Hitch and Relay families. Next, we created purpose-led storytelling, building meaningful emotional connections with the brand. We continue to lean into the strength of the Wear Your Shine campaign, which inspires consumers to use fashion as a means for personal expression and empowerment. The Shine collection included a range of gold and metallic bags, ready-to-wear and accessories, allowing customers to own their shine with confidence. We also delivered emotional content through our More than a gift campaign, which celebrates the gifts that give us the confidence to be ourselves. Overall, the success of these campaigns helped to support the acquisition of approximately 1.5 million new customers in North America, including a growing number of Gen Z and millennials. And according to our U.S. brand tracking work fielded during the quarter, Coach saw a lift in unaided awareness versus prior year led by gains with Gen Z consumers, underscoring that our investments in brand building are working. And finally, we continue to build momentum in our sub-brand Coachtopia, a reimagination of the product creation process to evolve our vision of circularity. During the quarter, Coachtopia's Ergo shoulder bag made with either repurposed leather or leather scraps was the top-selling style. While Coachtopia remains a small portion of the assortment, we are excited by the significant consumer attention it's receiving specifically with younger audiences. In closing, Coach continues to build strength on strength, with a clear strategy, unique purpose and commitment to investing behind sustainable growth. The power of expressive luxury rooted in deep consumer insights and consistent execution is bringing new innovation, new customers and new potential to this iconic brand, and we're confident in the tremendous runway ahead. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to advance our long-term priorities, reinforcing our strategic direction. Profits were ahead of both expectations and the prior year, led by gross margin expansion, demonstrating our agility and discipline. Having said that, top line trends remain challenged. In order to realize the ambition we have for the brand, we need to accelerate our progress through improved execution. To this end, we see an opportunity in 3 key areas: first, strengthening Kate Spade's core handbag offering; second, powering the Omnichannel experience; and third, driving more emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat. Now I'll touch on our quarterly results in each of these focus areas in more detail. First, we are reimagining and broadening the brand's core handbag assortment across channels, creating the foundation to be a larger and more profitable brand consistent with our strategic intent. And where we've provided more newness, innovation and emotion, our customers have responded. However, the traction we've seen with new products was offset by declines in carryover families, which underperformed our expectation. This reinforces the need to move faster to build a more innovative core assortment that's required to win in today's dynamic consumer backdrop. Moving forward, we are laser-focused on improving the execution of our handbag offering, bringing more relevancy to the assortment. The pipeline for the back half of the year and into fiscal year '25 will increase the penetration of newness across channels with the launch of bags featuring new materials, silhouettes and distinctive branding elements. This innovation builds on the green shoots we're seeing today, while incorporating consumer feedback and insights, which help to inform our product strategies and investments. At the same time, we'll maintain the strength of our novelty and lifestyle offerings, differentiators for the Kate Spade brand. To this point, footwear rose double digits in the quarter, while jewelry remained an important acquisition vehicle consistent with our strategy and focus on enhancing customer lifetime value. Second, the execution of a cohesive Omnichannel strategy is a key opportunity to drive stronger customer engagement. During the quarter, we launched a dedicated Kate Spade outlet.com site, replacing the brand surprise site and providing a more seamless way for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. Overall, by bringing a more focused and unified experience to consumers across all brand touch points, we can more efficiently scale our marketing and merchandising efforts, supporting our goal of driving sustainable direct-to-consumer growth. Third, we are focused on creating emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat on a global scale. During the quarter, our marketing investments supported the acquisition of approximately 950,000 new customers to the brand in North America. In keeping with our strategy to become a more global brand, we launched a series of physical activations from London to Shanghai that brought the brand Coach to life and helped grow brand awareness internationally. Moving forward, we recognize the need to distort our marketing efforts to brand building to enhance our impact. Unique storytelling has been a strength of the brand over time. And as we move into spring, we will focus on creating marketing to drive fashion credibility and customer engagement by shifting our investment to top-of-funnel marketing through the launch of our campaign anchored in the brand codes of joy, color and New York City. Finally, as we fuel enhanced innovation, we will maintain a commitment to operational excellence, positioning the brand for long-term success. This focus has supported the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion thus far this year and is embedded in our strategies and ways of working for the future. Overall, while we're continuing to advance our long-term strategies at Kate Spade, we're leaning in with intention to accelerate our progress. Our path forward is clear and our vision for the brand and its potential is unchanged. Turning to Stuart Weitzman. Top line results in the quarter were pressured, reflecting in part the ongoing strategic reduction in off-price wholesale shipments. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in China against last year's COVID-impacted compare and continued positive wholesale POS trends. Further, we grew AUR, expanded gross margin and improved profitability versus prior year. That said, we remain unsatisfied with the brand's pace of recovery, and we continue to focus on prioritizing brand health and delivering innovation for consumers. Touching on key elements of the brand's strategic growth pillars from the quarter. First, we curated a relevant offering of emotional product. We delivered growth in our core boot classification, fueled by gains in the Soho and 5050 families. Further, we continued to build out our assortment with more seasonless casual styles, including loafers and belle flats. During the quarter, we also launched a new sneaker assortment featuring a range of innovative designs, engineered to combine fashion and function. At the same time, our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment, drove growth at high AUR. As we move forward, we will deliver more newness into the core assortment in keeping with rapidly evolving consumer trends. Next, we created engaging marketing to fuel brand heat and consideration. In celebration of the brand's 30th anniversary, we employed a multipronged approach to our marketing, including utilizing an array of influencers to organically engage with consumers from He Cong to Kim Kardashian to Sofia Richie Grainge. As a result, we saw brand awareness improve in the U.S. per YouGov and drove increased customer engagement across our social channels. Similarly, in China, brand exposure rose significantly following the launch of this campaign. Overall, the Stuart Weitzman team is focused on executing against its strategic priorities, fueling brand heat and deepening customer engagement through a stronger, more diversified foundation of differentiated product and emotional purpose-led storytelling to drive enhanced growth and profitability long term. In closing, Tapestry delivered a strong second quarter, positioning us to raise our earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year. Importantly, this reflects the progress we're making to advance our strategic agenda and power our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer in an ever-changing environment while investing in our future. We remain confident in our vision and in our ability to bring that vision to life, putting the customer at the center of everything we do to drive sustainable organic top and bottom line gains. Further, through the planned acquisition of Capri, we see a significant opportunity to accelerate our strategies while driving accretion to our strong stand-alone financial plan. Overall, we remain excited by the opportunity to expand our house of powerful brands, positioning Tapestry as a leader in innovation, talent development and shareholder returns for years to come. We continue to make progress towards closing the transaction and look forward to sharing more detailed growth strategies for the future at an appropriate time. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '24 outlook. Scott?"", 'Scott A. Roe', ""Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, our fiscal Q2 results exceeded expectations. We delivered top line growth, significantly expanded gross margin and drove record revenue and EPS for the key holiday quarter while generating over $800 million in free cash flow. Our strong and consistent performance demonstrates the benefit of our globally diversified direct-to-consumer business model as well as our financial discipline and agility. It's this discipline that allows us to continue to invest in long-term brand growth while delivering record earnings. Now moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 3% compared to the prior year, fueled by strong international growth of 12%. In Greater China, revenue rose 19% as we anniversaried last year's COVID-impacted results. At the same time, we've continued to see an uptick in travel spend from Mainland China tourist with increases across Asia and Europe. While these trends have been encouraging, sales to Chinese tourists globally remain well below pre-pandemic levels, representing further opportunity ahead. Outside of China, we drove growth in our key international regions, anniversarying strong gains in the prior year. In Japan, sales grew 6% due to increased tourist demand, and in Other Asia, revenue grew 9%, including strength in Korea, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, momentum continued with revenue 11% above last year. And in North America, sales were in line with the prior year and above expectations on stronger margins, supporting brand health and not chasing sales. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 4%, fueled by mid-single-digit growth in both stores and digital. And in wholesale, which represents about 10% of sales globally, revenue declined 4%, reflecting wholesale market pressure in North America, partially offset by growth in international accounts. Moving down to P&L. We delivered our strongest second quarter gross margin in over a decade, which was ahead of our expectations and 300 basis points above last year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by a benefit of 170 basis points due to lower freight expense as well as operational outperformance, fueled by geographic mix tailwinds and net pricing improvements. SG&A rose 5%, which was favorable to our forecast on both a dollar and a rate basis, reflecting operational savings compared to plan. Importantly, we're continuing to tightly control costs while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms. So taken together, operating margin expanded 220 basis points and operating income rose 14% compared to the prior year, both ahead of our expectations. And our record second quarter EPS of $1.63 was ahead of guidance and represented growth of 20%. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.7 billion, which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri, which I'll touch on momentarily. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $804 million. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $30 million. And inventory levels at quarter end were 15% below prior year, reflecting our focus on disciplined inventory management and driving inventory return. Before moving on, I did want to touch on the disruption related to the Red Sea conflict. We're closely monitoring this situation and currently estimate a modest increase in lead times and freight costs in the back half of the fiscal year, which has been incorporated in the outlook provided today. Importantly, we currently anticipate minimal impact to our operating results and customer experience given our well-positioned inventory. Turning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $81 million in dividend payments for the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal '24, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. Our strong second quarter results position us to raise our EPS outlook for the fiscal year, while taking a prudent approach to our second half planning. On revenue, we're maintaining our outlook on a reported basis as we reflect Coach's outperformance in the second quarter as well as moderating headwinds from FX, offset by lower expectations at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. At the same time, we're raising our EPS estimate for the year, given our stronger margin results and commitment to being disciplined stewards of our brands. Our guidance also reflects the strategic decision to invest a portion of our Q2 profit be back into our brands and business to support our long-term strategies. Moving to the fiscal year in further detail. We expect revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, representing an increase in the area of 1% versus prior year on a reported basis. Excluding an FX headwind of roughly 100 basis points, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of 2%. Turning to sales details by region at constant currency, which are unchanged from the ranges previously provided. In North America, we expect revenue to be in line with to slightly above prior year. This forecast contemplates our commitment to maintaining higher margins as we manage our brands and business for the long term. In Greater China, we expect mid-single-digit sales growth. In Japan, revenue is forecasted to grow mid-single digits, while Other Asia is expected to increase at a low double-digit rate. And in Europe, we anticipate high single-digit growth. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points. We anticipate gross margin gains in the area of 200 basis points, which includes a benefit from moderating freight costs of roughly 120 basis points. On SG&A expenses, we expect deleverage of roughly 100 basis points, reflecting reinvestments in our brands, people and business in support of growth initiatives. Moving to the below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $20 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 233 million shares. So taken together, we're now projecting EPS of $4.20 to $4.25, representing 8% to 9% growth versus last year. Finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we still anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. This forecast includes roughly half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Now let me take you through the shaping of the year. We continue to expect relatively consistent constant currency top line growth between the first half and second half at around 2%. This includes the expectation for stronger growth in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, helped by the anniversary of easier comparisons in North America. On operating income, as noted, we're utilizing a portion of our outperformance in the second quarter to reinvest in our people, brands and business. Therefore, our outlook now contemplates second half operating income to be roughly in line with the prior year. By quarter, we expect gross margin expansion in both the third and fourth quarters, with modestly higher SG&A dollar growth in Q3 versus Q4 based on the pace of our investments versus the prior year. For the third quarter specifically, we anticipate revenue to be in line with to slightly above prior year in constant currency and down slightly on a reported basis, including roughly 120 basis points of FX pressure. In aggregate, we expect EPS for the third quarter to be in the area of $0.65, with growth anticipated for Q4. Now to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We are committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we initiated a long-term leverage target of less than 2.5x on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within 2 years of the Capri transaction close. Finally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend. Importantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future. Before closing, I want to touch more holistically on the planned acquisition of Capri. We believe the acquisition will drive significant value creation with immediate accretion to adjusted earnings, enhanced cash flow and strong financial returns, underpinned by a compelling industrial logic that is consistent with our commitment to being disciplined financial operators. To this end, it's important to highlight that we continue to expect Capri to generate double-digit EPS accretion on an adjusted basis and compelling ROIC. Embedded in these expectations is the assumption that the stand-alone Capri business will generate free cash flow in the area of $500 million on a non-GAAP unsynergized basis. And as noted, we've made further progress towards transaction close. In November, we issued $6.1 billion in USD and euro bonds, achieving an all-in debt interest rate of 6.5%, inclusive of Tapestry's existing debt and consistent with our expectations. Our financing strategy supports rapid debt paydown in order to achieve our stated leverage target within 24 months post close, given the combined company's strong free cash flow generation. We're moving forward with integration planning efforts and continue to gain confidence in our ability to achieve run rate cost synergies of over $200 million within 3 years of closing. And finally, we're continuing to work towards receiving all required regulatory approvals, and as publicly announced by the Chinese regulatory authority, the transaction received clearance in China. In terms of timing, we remain confident in our ability to complete the transaction with a close expected in calendar 2024, consistent with our original expectations. In closing, for the quarter, we drove strong results, highlighted by revenue gains, significant margin expansion, earnings' growth and cash flow generation while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business. This outperformance demonstrates the power of our strategies, operating model and talented global teams. Looking forward, we will remain disciplined stewards of our brands and business with an unwavering commitment to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for years to come. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator and take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""Congratulations on a great quarter. Can you talk about the strength you're seeing at Coach, at the Coach brand and your confidence in maintaining the momentum? And separately, I just have a question on the deal. Since you announced the transaction, we've seen a softening of trends at Capri. Can you just give us an update on if and how this has changed any of your thinking?"", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""We delivered a solid holiday quarter, which is a testament to the strong and passionate teams we have around the world. And first, I want to recognize that we are executing consistently. We delivered growth across revenue, operating income and earnings per share. In fact, we delivered record second quarter earnings per share. And at the same time, we're delivering gross margin and operating margin expansion, really showing that we're maintaining brand health while delivering against our earnings commitments, which is protecting the bright future we see for our brand. These results speak to the operational excellence and the discipline that we've shown now for over 3 years, and we're driving strong and consistent free cash flow. And to your point, importantly, we are gaining momentum at Coach. And instead of stealing all of Todd's thunder, maybe I'll pass it to him to let him comment on that momentum, the sustainability of that momentum and then I'll come back at the end and pick up your question on the acquisition. Todd?"", 'Todd Kahn', ""Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, Bob. I'm feeling very confident about our future because of our brand positioning of expressive luxury, which we launched in September of '23. What it did, it provided us with a clarity and focus on the target market, the timeless Gen Z consumer. With that consumer in mind, this fall and into holiday, we launched our Wear Your Shine campaign. The traction that we've seen with this campaign building on momentum of previous purpose campaign confirms the opportunity to talk to our clients in an authentic, unique and meaningful way. Turning to product. Our innovation is working as demonstrated by our Tabby family, which I can't talk enough about. So when you take our storytelling and compelling product together, we are driving meaningful growth with new and younger consumers and generating brand heat. This leads me to talk about what we refer to as cogenomic. We grow our gross margin by reducing COGS, increasing initial pricing and reducing promotions, coupled with efficient non-marketing SG&A allows us to invest in full funnel marketing, which drives productive sales. This creates a virtuous flywheel. Growing sales enhances the lifetime value of our new and younger clients. Our cogenomic model bodes well for our future growth in the quarters and years ahead."", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""Well, thanks, Todd. And let me pick up on your question on the acquisition. I'll start by saying these are great brands, and we remain excited about the runway ahead. We recognize the opportunity to unlock value by improving execution, leveraging the Tapestry platform, and we have continued confidence evidenced by the Coach results that Todd just referenced, that our strategies and our execution deliver. And in terms of the deal, the economics remain strong. We're making progress as we expected towards the close in this calendar year that's unchanged from our prior outlook. And in the meantime, integration planning efforts continue. I've been impressed with how the teams are working together. And we continue to gain confidence in the opportunities where we can add value. Importantly, though, we remain laser-focused on driving our organic business, which is reflected in the strong second quarter beat and raise we reported today."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo."", 'Irwin Bernard Boruchow', ""I'll add my congrats. So I guess, maybe this is for Scott or Joanne. But I think, Scott, back in August, I'm trying to think about the business organically, so excluding the pre in any deals. In August, you gave us some updated thoughts on the fiscal '25 organic goals you guys have set for yourself, which included the 19% margins and you took the $5 down to $465 million because of the lack of repo. Curious if you could give us some updated thoughts on how those targets are evolving internally? And really, Scott, I'm specifically asking because your brand performance looks very different versus your initial goals with the Coach margins looking to come in at least this year, probably a few hundred basis points above the 30% goal you set for fiscal '25 and kind of the opposite several hundred basis points below the mid-teens goals. So any just thoughts on how that's all evolving would help us when we kind of think about the business organically into next year."", 'Scott A. Roe', ""Yes, sure. I'm happy to take it. So just to reiterate, first of all, the $465 million, which is really the -- as you said, the $5 less, the curtailment of the share repos, we still have confidence. And yes, has it evolved a little differently? It has. But I think not only is this a testament to the momentum that you see in Coach, but also, I think it speaks to our model, right? And the discipline being capital allocators, we're feeding those opportunities where we see growth. You're seeing the discipline across the P&L, as Joanne mentioned, in terms of gross margin expansion. We're getting leverage across most cost areas and reinvesting back where we see points of difference in the ability to drive the brand. So while it's evolved a little bit differently, yes, we still have the confidence, and I think that just speaks to the diversity of the model and I think the discipline in this organization."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', ""Congrats on the nice quarter. So Joanne, as we think about new customer acquisition, could you speak to differentiation of the Tapestry portfolio platform that you think allows the product innovation, data capabilities that support the continued global momentum? And then for Scott, could you speak to the continued gross margin drivers multiyear, maybe beyond this year's freight recovery? And just how best to think about or any change to double-digit accretion in year 1 from the planned acquisition?"", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""So I'll kick it off on our customer -- what we call customer obsession. And it is really the engine that drives growth for our brands, but frankly, for all brands. And it really does start with being curious about the customer and understanding how to bring our brand to the market with even more relevance, more connectivity and truly a more emotional -- creating a more emotional connection with the consumer. We start that -- it really permeates our entire value chain. So we start early with understanding who our target customer is and what the true DNA of each of our brands is and how that fits. But then we talk to a lot of customers. We do a tremendous amount of customer research, not only research that does our brand tracking, but deeper ethnographic research to understand how the customer feels in a store environment, feels about our product, feels about their outlook on the world, and that's something that always changes. So it's a continuous curiosity, I would say, in the company. We ingest those -- that data across our company. And I talk a lot about putting the data and the insights in the hands of decision makers, the ways of working have changed at Tapestry over the last 4 years. And our teams are better and better gaining these insights and applying them to all of our work across the value chain. So we are using this not only in our brand positioning, but also in our product development, understanding as we develop products, who we are speaking to and what value we are delivering, both emotional value as well as functional value, what needs we're fulfilling for the consumer. And then we leverage data and insight as it relates to pricing, as it relates to our assortment, the breadth and depth of our assortment and allocation across the world and where that product and how that product shows up around the world, we test and learn on our website and some of our marketing capabilities so that we can continue to improve our execution. So all the way -- and I don't know if I mentioned pricing, but pricing as well. So all the way through the value chain. And importantly, our focus has been to attract younger consumers to our brands. And we've seen a lot of traction with our execution behind the insights that we found. And you can see that, as we talked about the 2.5 million new customers we attracted the brands in this past quarter, nearly half being Gen Z and millennial that is critical for us to continue to create the momentum we want to create for each of our brands. And then I don't know if you want to pick up the gross margin drivers?"", 'Scott A. Roe', ""Yes. I'd love to. I'd love to talk about gross margin, and I'll really start where you ended. And I think even if you look at this year, Matt, reinvesting back in those capabilities that help us understand who these consumers are, all the things that Joanne said, that's what gives us confidence in our pricing power longer term, and that's a key driver. And we see that when you take out the noise of freight and some of the other things, some of the mix, regional, all that stuff that's going on quarter-by-quarter, we still see that core operational improvement is coming through, and we expect that to continue. And I'm not going to give -- we're not giving '25 and beyond guidance other than the earnings reaffirmation on the $465 million that I talked about, but one of the key linchpins is what Todd and Joanne both talked about that flywheel, reinvesting back in the business which reinforces our margins and those margins that allow us to both increase our profitability and reinvest at the same time. You also asked a little bit about double-digit accretion in year 1. Short answer, I assume we were talking about the Capri deal? The answer is yes. And I would also just add, in addition to accretion, which is kind of a mathematics problem, we also see strong returns in excess of our WACC. So we see return on capital that is also accretive as we continue to look at the deal. Remember, we never bought into necessarily euros estimates. We had what we call prudent assumptions on the condition of the business and we still have confidence in those key drivers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.', 'Lorraine Corrine Maikis Hutchinson', ""I wanted to focus on China for a minute. Understanding the year-over-year comparisons are pretty volatile. Joanne, can you just zoom out and give us your view on the health of the Chinese consumer? And what's driving the Coach brand strength in China specifically?"", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""Sure. We continue to believe that China represents long-term opportunity across our brands. And as you know, we've been in the market for a long time with the Coach brand over 2 decades. As it relates to the business right now, we are seeing a slower pace of recovery in the market. But our China business was landed right in line with our expectations in the second quarter at up 19%. Our outlook for this fiscal year is that we will drive mid-single-digit growth in the year. That expectation is unchanged. So the dynamics in the market are unfolding the way we expected. And again, we continue to have confidence in the long-term opportunity in the market. And what's driving our success is that our teams in the market are doing an excellent job building our brands and connecting with consumers. We continue to see consumer desire for our brands is strong and we saw that through the second quarter. And importantly, in the surveys we field in the market purchase intent in our category, handbags and leather goods is still high with consumers in the market. So again, expectations are high. Maybe I'll pass it to Todd, if there's any other color on your secret sauce in the market, Todd?"", 'Todd Kahn', ""Well, I won't give away the full secret sauce, but I will say building on your comment, we feel really good about China, particularly the long-term opportunities in China. And one of the things that I point to and one of the questions all of you ask me every quarter is how do you continue to see AUR growth and expansion. When you look at where the Coach brand sits today and the white space between us and traditional European luxury, that's at an all-time high. And in a market like China, where maybe people are being more frugal and thoughtful about their purchase, that bodes very well for Coach. So I'm excited by the white space. I'm excited by our brand positioning, expressive luxury is working, as Joanne said in the prepared remarks. Our last quarter, we saw growth in all markets, including China. So excited by what we have coming up and we're already seeing Coach and Tabby take hold in that market in a really meaningful way."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.', 'Brooke Siler Roach', ""Joanne, I was hoping you could provide some additional thoughts on how you're thinking about the outlook for North America handbag and accessories, but specifically both for your Coach brand and for Kate Spade? What's driving the underlying confidence in stronger growth in the back half of the year, specifically in fiscal fourth quarter? And how are you thinking about that relative to the competitive pressures that you might be seeing in the market?"", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""Yes. North American market is always competitive. So we love a competitive market, and we're performing. What we saw in Q2, our business was flat with last year -- in line with last year, but above our expectations. And we're driving that business at higher margins. So we continue to prioritize a healthy business and healthy -- and managing a healthy business, and we will focus on healthy growth in the market. What we see happening in the market is, frankly, the consumer is being choiceful and they're responding to newness and innovation and the elevated brand messaging that we're delivering in the market. And we'll continue to do that. Our outlook for the rest of the year is, frankly, in line with where it was in the first half. So no dramatic inflection in the first -- between first half and second half of the year. We think trends will be in line. But again, we're managing the business in a healthy way. We grew AUR last quarter, expanded gross margin and operating margin. Our inventories importantly are well positioned, not only in North America, but globally. So we expect to continue to manage a healthy business in North America as we move forward."", 'Todd Kahn', ""And the only thing I'll add for Coach is, obviously, we're always aware of competition, but we're playing our own game. And this new virtuous flywheel where we're really growing these new customers, 1.5 million in North America last year. They're younger, they're transacting at a higher AUR, that's the fuel, that's the cogenomics that will play out in many quarters ahead. So they're coming in at our brand. We're touching them through expressive luxury through with purpose and innovation. And as long as we keep doing that, using our data, I think there's so much room for growth in North America.We feel really stronger about what's ahead of us, particularly in the fourth quarter where we have easier comps, obviously. But beyond the comp issue, we just see a lot of growth ahead even in our most mature market because as we saw, we can continue to grow awareness. So that's really important for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Michael Binetti of Evercore.', 'Michael Binetti', ""Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe just a near-term one first. On the revenue guidance for flat in third quarter, is that what you're seeing today? Maybe just comment there. It sounded like you're seeing an inflection in China with some of the comments on tourism, but then Todd also mentioned choicefulness in the consumers as well. Maybe just a little color on what to expect in China in the second half. And then maybe a jump ball, Joanne and Scott, Scott since we've talked about this for a lot of years at your previous life about the philosophy and the filters you used to assess which brands belong in a portfolio of brands, I'm curious how you guys look ahead to being a house of 6 brands on -- of different scales, different market shares within their sub-categories, different global opportunities. And maybe speak a little bit about what are the lenses you use at Tapestry to determine which brands are best fit within this platform."", 'Scott A. Roe', ""Yes. Sure, Michael. I'll take the first part of that. And you haven't read our website, man, all that's out there, anyway. The third quarter really -- there's a lot of noise but to make it simple, the biggest issue is China, right? So, if you think about -- in Q2, we were up 19%, in line with our guide. Our expectations, really that was anniversarying COVID issues. And then we had revenge spending, right, which is coming in Q3, so it's a tougher compare. But when you zoom out from that to click and look at the overall, we said mid-single digits last quarter in terms of our expectation, that's right where we are today. So yes, there's noise quarter by quarter. It puts particular pressure in the third quarter from a top and bottom line. But when you zoom out and look at the top, we beat in the second quarter, we took the full year up, right? So I would ask you to understand the noise but really don't lose the big picture here."", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""Yes. Let me pick up the portfolio shaping -- portfolio question you asked. We are creating a global house of iconic brands. And what's important to us, the most important thing is that these brands are iconic and that they trade in attractive and growing categories. Adding these brands to our platform, we've talked about the strong industrial logic of this transaction. It extends our reach across customer segments, across geographies and across product categories. So it provides more diversification for our business, and taken together, enhances our opportunity to drive value -- superior value for all of our stakeholders. We are disciplined capital allocators. And to your point, we -- any capital allocation decision we make, we use a 4-lens framework. You mentioned lenses. There is rigor and discipline in our evaluation. That's how we arrived at the decision to make the acquisition of Capri. And the 4 lenses are really, first, does it fit with our strategies as a company; second, what do we bring as an owner, are we a good owner of these assets; third, what is the financial outcome we expect in the modeling and the shareholder return we expect; and the fourth lens is really a degree of difficulty of execution. And as we evaluated all of those, we landed on this Capri acquisition is quite compelling. And any future capital allocation decision we make will apply those same 4 lenses and the same rigor and discipline."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird.', 'Mark R. Altschwager', ""A couple of questions on Kate. First, you talked about the need to accelerate some of the changes there. What are the insights you've gathered over the last few quarters that are informing the changes you're making to plans over the next few seasons here? And then separately, on margin, you are delivering margin expansion at Kate despite the ongoing sales pressure this year, which is nice to see. So I was hoping you could just update us on how you're thinking about that path to the mid or even high-teens EBIT margin. What's the timeline there? And is there a level of revenue that is needed to get within that range?"", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""Thanks, Mark. We remain confident, to your point, in the strategies and our long-term vision for Kate Spade. The team exercised incredible discipline and agility in the quarter. To your point, we expanded gross margin, operating margin and profit. All of those were ahead of last year and ahead of our expectations. But to your point, the top line remains challenging. We didn't see an inflection from first quarter. So we saw a continuation of our first quarter trends. And we have higher aspirations for the brand as it relates to growth. We noted an opportunity to improve our execution and really 3 key areas we talked about in our prepared remarks. We've been focused on strengthening the core handbag foundation. And that continues to be an opportunity. Where we've delivered newness and innovation in our core handbag assortment, we are seeing the customer respond. And we will see as we move into the back half newness grow, both in the back half and into fiscal 2025. Newness will grow as a percent in penetration in our assortment. The second opportunity that we see is an opportunity to power the Omnichannel experience with our consumers. You saw us launch outlet.com in the last quarter. That is an important foundational element to provide consumers a real 360 experience and a quality 360 experience with the brand. We believe that we can build on that foundation as we move forward. And then last, it's an opportunity to drive more emotional marketing to fuel brand heat. So it's around the execution in these 3 points. You'll see us -- actually, this week, we launched our spring campaign. We'll be investing more in top-of-funnel marketing to cut through the noise and drive more brand heat. We have clear actions in place. We're moving with speed to achieve those higher aspirations we have for the brand. The pace of the margin improvement is welcome this year, again, ahead of expectations in the quarter. And we expect continued growth, both on the top line as well as margin. And certainly, top line growth is a part of it. But as we demonstrated this quarter, there are other opportunities that we are leveraging to drive growth in operating margin."", 'Scott A. Roe', ""Yes. And maybe I'll just do a quick build on that, Mark. We do still see a path to the teens operating margin. And I think this year, even overall at Tapestry with modest growth, I mean, a couple of percent of growth, the discipline of our teams and you think about everything from gross margin expansion, controlling expenses and operating margin expansion even as the top line has been pressured, that's disciplined, right? And we didn't mention it but inventory, down teens -- overall down teens in this brand, right? So we've made room for innovation and new product coming in the second time. One thing that our insights do and don't do, as I've said repeatedly, they don't make it simple, right? But they, in general, help us make better decisions and because of our model and our direct-to-consumer data, we see trends and issues quicker. So that's allowed us to react in terms of inventory, to react in terms of expenses. And that's one of the reasons that you see this gross margin and operating expansion in Kate even with the pressure on the top line."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.', 'Oliver Chen', 'Tabby has been a really great platform. What do you see ahead? And will there be others that will be great second platforms in addition to Tabby? As we think about that average unit retail, is it more mix or like-for-like or a combination of both? And then on the Kate Spade side, why was now the right time for outlet? And you mentioned strengthening the core a few times. Just would love thoughts on what that really means and what your consumer research is indicating that you need there. And finally, Todd, Coachtopia has been amazing. Just how material is that to our model -- modeling? And where do you see that heading at the penetration over time?', 'Todd Kahn', 'I count it 5 questions total. Did we get that right? Do you want me to take the 3?', 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""We'll kick it off with Tabby, Todd. I think that's a great place to start."", 'Todd Kahn', ""I agree. Thank you, Oliver. First of all, Tabby is an incredible platform. And platforms aren't created by us, platforms are created by our clients. They both have, ultimately. Our job is to continue to innovate on a platform, keeping it relevant. And you see that with Tabby. I see Tabby as something that isn't a season or a year, it's a multiyear opportunity. We just launched Quilted Tabby, it's phenomenal. Really early readings, but it's doing incredibly well. And every time we launch a new iteration of Tabby in different fabrications or treatment, what it does is it elevates all of Tabby. So we're super pleased with what we're seeing there. On AUR, it is the combo of both initial pricing, less discounting, being really disciplined in our approach. So we're excited by that. Lastly, Coachtopia. Coachtopia is not meaningful enough from a dollars perspective yet to put in your model. What Coachtopia is doing for us is giving us a halo effect, I said this before, it basically outpunches its size yet. What we've seen is it's creating incredible desire and relevancy in the brand. There are some opportunities in Coachtopia that I think will, over time, become very big. The loop product for one, which is effectively a nylon product, which in our history, we have not particularly been strong with, that's resonating. And I could see that becoming something very material and maybe in a giant platform of its own one day. But again, it's not for us to decide. It's for our clients and consumers to vote."", 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""And I'll pick up the Kate question quickly here as we approach the end of our time. But for outlet.com at Kate, it really is about creating a better experience for our customers and a more 360 experience that customers in all channels at Kate Spade are served a tremendous experience and outlet.com allows us to do that, and we're excited about building on that foundation. And what we hear from our customers about strengthening the core handbag. Kate has very strong core equities. They're clear and joy and self-expression, but where they tell us Kate is not known for signature product or branding codes. That's the opportunity that we continue to build. You saw it with Dakota that we launched stronger hardware, stronger branding codes. We're excited about the Madison launch. It's a coated canvas spade flower signature program at Outlet last quarter, and that's off to a good start, and that's the work of the work. That's what we're focused on doing at Kate. But we're excited about the runway ahead there."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take a question from Paul Lejuez of Citi."", 'Paul Lawrence Lejuez', 'Curious what drove the gross margin beat. I think you mentioned operational performance, but any more specifics there in terms of -- by brand or channel? And how are you thinking about puts and takes in the second half, specifically on the freight side, I think you mentioned you may be seeing some pressure in dollars going up on the freight side as well. Any quantification that you can provide?', 'Scott A. Roe', ""Yes, happy to. What a great story, right? Over 300 basis points in the quarter and about 170 of that was freight. And as you correctly said, we expect it to moderate but still be positive in the second half. And I think for the full year with a 200 basis point expansion in our outlook, there's about 120 of freight benefit for the full year. So it's still positive, but moderating somewhat in the second half. And again, I'll reference an earlier comment. As you think forward, obviously, we're not going to give any outlook for '25. But I would just say that operationally, which is really what Todd was talking about in Coach, and by the way, we grew gross margin across all our brands. I don't know if I said that earlier. But really, it's that pricing power, which is a combination of headline prices and discipline around discounts. We see that coming through underneath all the freight noise and mix and all that stuff quarter-by-quarter, and we would expect, based on our reinvestment in our brands, increased marketing and the insights and understanding we have of the consumer that we expect that to continue as we move forward."", 'Operator', 'That concludes our question and answer. I will now turn it over to Joanne for some concluding remarks.', 'Joanne C. Crevoiserat', ""Well, thank you for joining us and for your interest in our story, and thank you to our talented global team who continue to build our brands and our relationships with consumers. It's clear that our strategies and consistent disciplined execution are delivering. We achieved record second quarter revenue and earnings per share and raised our earnings outlook for the full year while investing for the future. I'm confident in our significant runway ahead to drive sustainable growth and shareholder returns from this strong foundation. Thanks again, and have a great day."", 'Operator', ""This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.""]"

Is it China, is it luxury demand, or are there sort of individual things that each of these companies are doing right?"", ""JESSICA RAMIREZ: Thank you for having me.

And wholesale has been a weakness in North America, which we saw the drag with Ralph Lauren and that becoming their [INAUDIBLE] being flat over the Ralph Lauren story.

So from an operational standpoint, increasing digital, looking towards pushing on its core products, and really heritage. So Ralph Lauren, I think, sits in a nice sweet spot in terms of if the consumer is strapped for cash and is looking to spend, they will spend on a brand that they trust, a brand that has longevity, a brand that has heritage. Ralph Lauren sits under that.', ""And in terms of the true luxury consumer, I mean the price points go up.

So they're testing that. I quite like to hear that.

I'm talking about Kering, which owns Gucci. And Gucci didn't do as poorly as estimated, but how should we read that through to the sort of even ultra luxury consumer?"", 'JESSICA RAMIREZ: Yeah, so Kering has been an interesting story. Obviously, with Gucci, we did have some falls last year. Now, part of that has been due to the consumer that shops luxury maybe four times a year started pulling back.', 'Gucci was very much banked on a lot of local product. And a lot of the local product tends to end on that entry point level. So again, Gucci really had exposed that very largely and we saw some of those faults come through.', ""Now, once we started seeing that sort of snowball down with Gucci, they did start looking to increase the AURs and focus on that higher spending consumer.

Again, in where we are with the spend with luxury and looking towards true luxury spend, it is what everyone has called quiet luxury, a much more subtle luxury. So again, in an example of Ralph Lauren where they're focusing on their core product, that's very subtle. And again, they do tap into that quiet luxury.

This goes part way to explaining why the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index is up a solid 45% in the past year.', ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) played a central role in driving the impressive surge in tech stocks. Shares of the graphics card specialist have tripled over the past year thanks to AI. The company will release its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results later this month, and analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase a solid 119% year over year to $59 billion. What's more, Nvidia's earnings are set to jump from $3.34 per share in fiscal 2023 to $12.30 per share in fiscal 2024 as per consensus estimates."", ""Even better, Nvidia could sustain its healthy stock market momentum as analysts have been raising their growth estimates thanks to the company's dominant position in AI chips. That could lead to eye-popping multiyear growth for the company."", ""However, Nvidia's expensive price-to-sales multiple of 37 and price-to-earnings multiple of 87 may lead value investors to look for better bets in the technology space (even if Nvidia is able to justify its expensive valuation by delivering stellar growth). The good news is that there are a couple of other tech stocks significantly cheaper than Nvidia that investors should consider buying right away before they fly higher."", ""Share prices of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) shot up 155% in the past year, and the company's latest earnings report suggests that the rally is here to stay. Meta stock jumped 20% on the day after the company released its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb. 1."", ""The social media giant reported a nice year-over-year jump of 25% in revenue to $40.1 billion, while earnings increased a whopping 103% to $5.33 per share. The numbers were well ahead of Wall Street's expectations, as analysts would have settled for $4.82 per share in earnings on $39.1 billion in revenue. More importantly, Meta's revenue guidance of $34.5 billion to $37 billion for the current quarter turned out to be better than consensus expectations of $33.9 billion."", ""The midpoint of the guidance range points toward a year-over-year increase of 25%. However, there was another factor that led to a sharp spike in Meta stock following its earnings release -- the company's announcement that it is initiating a quarterly dividend. Meta will pay a cash dividend of $0.50 per share next month, and it intends to pay a quarterly dividend going forward."", ""Given that the digital ad market that Meta serves is set to grow 13.2% in 2024, up from last year's 10.7% growth, it won't be surprising to see the company sustain its impressive growth momentum through 2024. Additionally, digital ad spending is predicted to increase by 11% in 2025, followed by almost 10% growth in 2026. All this indicates why analysts recently raised their growth expectations for Meta."", 'Meta stock is trading at 9 times sales right now, which is almost in line with its five-year average sales multiple and is a significantly cheaper multiple than Nvidia. Assuming it can maintain such a multiple next year and hits $197 billion in revenue, as the chart above indicates, its market cap could increase to $1.77 trillion over the next three years. That would be a nice jump of 46% from its current market cap.', ""However, if the market rewards Meta with a higher sales multiple thanks to its accelerating growth, it could deliver more upside. That's why investors looking to buy a top tech stock right now should consider buying Meta before it jumps higher."", ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is another tech stock that got a nice boost following the release of its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb. 1. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant jumped 8% as the company's revenue increased 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating the $166.2 billion consensus estimate."", ""Amazon's earnings, on the other hand, jumped from just $0.03 per share in the year-ago period to $1 per share last quarter, handsomely exceeding the $0.80 per share Wall Street estimate. The company's robust year-over-year growth was driven by improvements across all of its business segments, while a slower increase in its expenses led to a strong bottom-line jump."", ""What's more, Amazon is expecting to deliver double-digit growth once again in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range. It forecasts revenue to land between $138 billion and $143.5 billion in the current quarter, an increase of 8% to 13% over the prior-year period. The company's operating income guidance of $8 billion to $12 billion points toward a big jump from the year-ago period's figure of $4.8 billion, and it is ahead of the $9.1 billion Wall Street estimate at the midpoint."", ""However, don't be surprised to see Amazon clocking faster growth as it has been tapping AI to make its mark in fast-growing markets."", 'First, the company is integrating generative AI tools into its e-commerce platform. It has rolled out an AI-powered shopping assistant, christened Rufus, which Amazon says has been ""trained on Amazon\'s product catalog and information from across the web to answer customer questions on shopping needs, products, and comparisons, make recommendations based on this context, and facilitate product discovery.""', ""The company believes that Rufus will make it easier for customers to find and purchase products on its platform. Such tools can help Amazon capture a greater share of the e-commerce market, which is expected to clock 9.4% growth in 2024 and generate $6.33 trillion in revenue. By 2027, the global e-commerce market is anticipated to clock annual sales of over $8 trillion. So, Amazon's focus on giving tools to customers that could help elevate their shopping experience could act as a catalyst for its long-term growth."", 'On the other hand, Amazon is in a nice position to capitalize on the fast-growing market for AI in the cloud. The company has been collaborating with Nvidia to bring the latest hardware and software to customers so that they can train AI models and build generative AI applications in a cost-effective manner. Amazon Web Services is the top provider of cloud infrastructure services in the world, with a market share of 32%.', ""With the market for AI in the cloud predicted to jump to $887 billion in 2032 from $43 billion in 2022, Amazon's focus on this market could eventually lead to huge gains in the long run. As such, it is not surprising to see why analysts are predicting the company's earnings to increase at an impressive annual rate of 87% for the next five years."", ""That's why investors would do well to buy Amazon stock while it is trading at a relatively cheaper 59 times trailing earnings when compared to Nvidia's multiple of 83, especially considering that the latter's earnings are forecast to grow at 102% a year for the next five years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

However, chip-market trends indicate Nvidia's supremacy will be challenging for competitors to overcome."", ""Despite AMD's and Intel's presence in the sector, Nvidia held an over 80% market share in desktop GPUs for years. Intel only entered the industry last year, while AMD's history in desktop GPUs spans decades. Still, AMD's GPUs only account for about 10% of the market."", 'A similar situation occurred in the central processing unit (CPU) industry.

The company's financial tables indicate a 15% increase in revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year, signaling strong market growth and customer volume expansion. Despite this, gross profit saw a 1% decrease, and total operating expenses rose by 30%, reflecting the dynamic and challenging environment in which McKesson operates. With a diluted earnings per share from continuing operations at $4.42, down from $7.65 in the previous year, McKesson navigates through market complexities, including the bankruptcy of a major customer, Rite Aid. The company's strategic divestitures, such as the sale of its European Union businesses, and its continued investment in technology and healthcare solutions underscore its forward-looking approach to business."", ""Market Leadership and Scale: McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) stands as one of the titans in the U.S. pharmaceutical distribution landscape, with its recent financials underscoring a 15% revenue surge. This growth trajectory is a testament to McKesson's entrenched market position and its ability to leverage scale to negotiate favorable terms with manufacturers and customers. The company's expansive distribution network and comprehensive product offerings enable it to meet diverse customer needs effectively, reinforcing its competitive moat."", ""Technological Prowess: McKesson's Prescription Technology Solutions (RxTS) segment is a beacon of innovation, connecting various stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. This segment's focus on addressing medication access and adherence challenges through technology solutions is a strategic asset that differentiates McKesson.

The company must navigate these challenges carefully to maintain its financial stability and mitigate the risks of dependency on a limited number of large customers."", 'Operational Costs: The increase in total operating expenses by 30% reflects rising costs that could squeeze margins if not managed effectively.

The challenge for McKesson lies in effectively reallocating resources and capitalizing on growth opportunities to offset the divestiture's impact and maintain a trajectory of profitability."", ""Market Growth: The pharmaceutical industry is witnessing sustained growth driven by an aging population, increased drug utilization, and the introduction of new therapies. McKesson, with its established distribution network and partnerships, is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth.

With that, let me turn it over to Brian.', 'Brian Tyler: Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining our call. McKesson reported a solid fiscal third quarter highlighting the continued momentum across the business. We delivered total revenues of $80.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.74 both of which grew by double-digits when compared to the prior year. As a result of the recent performance and our latest outlook we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.80 to $27.40 to an updated range of $27.25 to $27.65. This solid financial performance is driven by that focus execution against our company priorities as a diversified healthcare services company we are uniquely positioned to improve healthcare in every setting.', ""This includes the areas of oncology and biopharma services. We continue to make significant progress in advancing our strategy and priorities, and I'm pleased to share some of the updates with you today. Let me start where I always like to start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. I start here because it's foundational to everything we do at McKesson. In January, our board of directors welcomed Kevin Ozan as a new independent director. As the former Chief Financial Officer of McDonald's Corporation, Mr. Ozan has over two decades of experience in both strategy and finance, and will contribute a valuable perspective to our boardroom. We look forward to his leadership as we work together to deliver on our growth initiatives. Driving the growth of our company requires a talented and diverse leadership team, and equally important, a diverse workforce where each individual is empowered to bring their own opinions, their own ideas, and perspectives."", ""Our commitment to best talent and inclusion is reflected in every aspect of our operations. It's how we build a support network for our employees and how we each live these values through everyday interactions. And I'm pleased to see our efforts being recognized. For the 11th consecutive year, McKesson was named as a military-friendly employer. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity, and a Quality 100 award winner by the Human Rights Campaign. I'm proud of what we've achieved as a team and I'm truly grateful to the McKesson employees for upholding our culture, values, and delivering for all of our stakeholders, our patients, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, and importantly, each other."", 'Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth, in the fiscal third quarter, we saw good performance in our distribution businesses. In U.S. pharmaceutical, adjusted operating profit grew 6%, reflecting broad-based momentum within the segment. We continue to enhance our scaled distribution network improving efficiency through investments in automation and technology. Over the past year, we opened two new distribution centers in the U.S. that are equipped with innovative technology and employee-friendly design. These enhancements will enable our facilities to pick, pack, and ship medications to customers faster, while simultaneously helping to optimize employee productivity levels by reducing redundant tasks. The investments in our foundational distribution assets continue to support the growth of our business and the success of our customers.', 'During the third quarter, we saw solid volume increases across customer channels, which includes distribution to retail national accounts customers. At the consolidated level, prescription volume growth remains stable. Certain product categories, including specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications, continue to grow at a faster pace and contribute as a tailwind to our revenue growth. As a reminder, we anticipate the growth from GLP-1 medications to slow in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the inflection in volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In the medical-surgical segment, primary care visits showed modest improvement on a sequential basis after we observed general market moderations last quarter. The improvement was partially driven by overall increase in primary care visits.', ""However, when compared to the prior year, patient visit volumes in the medical segment remain a headwind to this quarter's performance. In the international segment, our Canadian business continues to perform well. It has a valuable portfolio of assets, including pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies, digital offerings. We're committed to strengthening and grow the business there. And as a part of that commitment, we're executing on a multi-year initiative that will modernize the distribution centers across Canada and deliver significant value to our employees and customers. Let me now continue on to talk about our oncology and biopharma platforms. We continue to build on the foundation of our core distribution capabilities, but we have strategically assembled a differentiated set of assets in oncology and biopharma services."", 'Within the oncology business, the U.S. Oncology Network expanded its footprint by entering the state of Tennessee. Over the past quarter, we welcomed two new practices, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners to the network. Through the combination of onboarding new practices and organic growth, the U.S. Oncology Network has grown its provider base to over 2,500, spreading across nearly 600 sites in 30 states. The expansion of the network strengthened our unique market position in community-based oncology practices and demonstrates our strong value proposition to providers. Through the U.S. Oncology Network, we provide a range of comprehensive solutions to ease the administrative and operational burden and to help enable the success of these community practices.', 'In the past quarter, we started integrating new artificial intelligence capabilities into the network, assisting providers with revenue cycle management and evaluating clinical solutions. With the help of AI and machine learning technologies, practices have been able to navigate complex insurance coverage and reimbursement processes more efficiently, allowing providers to spend more time focused on their patients. Within the biopharma services business, we continue to see strong market demand for our differentiated solutions that help improve access, affordability, and adherence to medications. In the third quarter of this fiscal third quarter, the prescription technology solution segment delivered strong performance, primarily driven by the growth in access solutions, including prior authorization solutions for branded pharmaceuticals such as GLP-1 medications.', ""Today, we provide prior authorization services for the vast majority of the GLP-1 medications in the market. Our integrated technology streamlines the prior authorization process and helps overcome medication access challenges that patients are facing. The main customers we serve are biopharma companies, and through our scaled network connection, we can electronically process requests both at the pharmacy counter and the provider's offices. The prior authorization solution is an example of the power of our capabilities and is part of a broader portfolio of patient support services we provide. We believe our solutions are highly differentiated and provide value to all stakeholders through a patient's journey. We're connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and approximately 900,000 providers."", 'The scale of our network provides a strong foundation that enables us to reach key stakeholders effectively and seamlessly. The integrated solutions we offer can often be accessed through a single digital entry point. For our biopharma customers, the integration helps streamline workflows and increase transparency into how programs work together. In the past quarter, our team has been working diligently to prepare for what we call the blizzard season. For the prescription technology solution segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest time of year due to customer annual verification activities. The annual reset of insurance policies typically drives a large influx of seasonal volumes for many of our programs. Each year, our teams come together to tackle the challenge of these significant volume increases.', ""I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver another successful blizzard season that is in line with our expectations. Our products and solutions in both oncology and biopharma services provide significant value to our customers as reflected in the continued growth of these businesses. We're excited about the market opportunities in both areas and we're confident in the scale and depth of our assets and expertise. We will continue to invest and innovate to support the evolving needs of our customers and their patients. So let me pull it all together. McKesson reported another solid quarter in fiscal 2024 that allowed us to raise and narrow our full year guidance for adjusted earnings for diluted share. We're committed to our shareholders to delivering long-term sustainable growth and this quarter's results reflect the continued progress in delivering on our commitment."", ""Healthcare is an ever-evolving market, but thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we never stopped finding new ways to drive positive impacts on our customers and their patients. I want to thank the over 50,000 McKesson employees who are working so tirelessly to advance our mission. And with that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insight and comments."", ""Britt Vitalone: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our fiscal third quarter 2024 results, which reflect another quarter of solid momentum with growth across our North American businesses. Our results exceeded expectations, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our third quarter GAAP only results. We recorded an additional pre-tax GAAP provision for bad debts of $515 million or $381 million after tax within the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. This provision is for uncollected trade accounts receivable from sales to Rite Aid in October of 2023 prior to its bankruptcy petition filing."", ""We continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid through an interim distribution agreement, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're closely monitoring developments. Rite Aid's bankruptcy will not have a material impact on our fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share results. The remainder of my comments will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results. Let me start with a review of the fiscal third quarter. McKesson delivered solid growth in the third quarter, led by sustained strong performance in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. This year-over-year growth underscores operating execution across our diversified and differentiated portfolio, including investments in oncology and biopharma services."", ""As a result of the third quarter operating performance and our confidence in the business, we're increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. Let me move to our consolidated results. Revenues increased 15% to $80.9 billion, led by continued strong utilization trends, growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the international segment, resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures within McKesson's European business. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%."", 'Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter and increased with 3%. When excluding the impact of our European business operations including completed divestitures and the impact from U.S. government COVID-19 programs in fiscal 2023, gross profit increased 10%. Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter due to higher costs to support growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. When excluding the impact of our European business operations including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Third quarter operating profit decreased 9% to $1.3 billion. Fiscal 2023 results included a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare.', ""Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. government COVID-19 programs, which were mitigated by contributions from commercial COVID-19 distribution and a non-recurring $30 million charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. These items were partially offset by growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solution segments. When adjusting for these items, including $126 million or $0.65 benefit from the early termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 7% in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense was $58 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year driven by effective management of our loan portfolio."", 'The effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%, resulting from the recognition of discrete tax benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 133.3 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Consolidated third quarter earnings per diluted share was $7.74, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior year. This increase includes the impacts of approximately $0.63 related to the U.S. government COVID-19 programs and the $0.65 benefit from the termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023, an increased commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution and a non-recurring charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2024.', 'Turning to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on slides seven through 11, and starting with the U.S. pharmaceutical. During the quarter, we experienced volume increases across all product categories and customer channels. Specialty Pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications continue to grow at a faster pace compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenues were $73 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $2.8 billion or 60% compared to fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we also noted increased contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution.', 'In our fiscal third quarter, commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution peaked in October, then declined significantly in November and December. We do not anticipate material contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the third quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $828 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Adjusting for the impact of the U.S. government COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, commercial COVID-19 distribution in fiscal 2024, and the $30 million non-recurring charge in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 8% year-over-year. In our prescription technology solution segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications and new brand launches led to increased demand for our access solutions such as prior authorization services.', ""For the third quarter, revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. And operating profit increased 25% to $193 million. Third quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions, principally prior authorization services and growth in our third party logistics business. In addition to the strength of prior authorization services, year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%, primarily driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, partially offset by anticipated lower contributions in the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program compared to the prior year."", ""In the third quarter, primary care patient visits moderately increased on a sequential basis. Demand for commercialized COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the alternate sites of care that we serve was also modestly higher compared to prior expectations. The overall illnesses and dynamics, including vaccinations and testing, continued to be an operating profit headwind in the quarter when compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique, depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Operating profit was $282 million, a decrease of 16%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and a softer illness season as compared to fiscal 2023."", ""When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 18% year-over-year, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European business, partially offset by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in Canada. Operating profit was $105 million, a decrease of 27%, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European business. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $147 million in the quarter, which included losses of $8 million, or $0.05 per share, related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio."", ""McKesson Ventures' impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. We remain pleased with the insights and the results that we're obtaining through this portfolio. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement in fiscal 2023, and gains and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, corporate expenses in the third quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. Turning now to cash flows and capital deployment, which can be found on slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents."", 'We delivered free cash flow of $100 billion in the third quarter, and $2.9 billion for the trailing 12-months. Third quarter free cash flow was impacted by the Right-Aid bankruptcy in October, and its associated $725 million provision for bad debts. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics, and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on, and therefore can vary from quarter-to-quarter. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we made capital expenditure investments of $418 million, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data, and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year-to-date, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $2.3 billion of share repurchases, and $232 million in dividend payments.', 'Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full list of our assumptions can be found on slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation. Let me start with the fiscal 2024 outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 18% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. The impact of elevated commercial COVID-19 distribution in the third quarter, net of the $30 million non-recurring charge, also in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, accounts for approximately 2% of segment growth.', 'The updated segment revenue outlook incorporates the strong third quarter performance and continued growth in specialty distribution, supported by stable utilization trends. Revenue growth assumes the GLP-1 medication volumes will continue to be robust, although the rate of growth will moderate in our fiscal fourth quarter. These medications are lower margin and represent a headwind to year-over-year operating profit growth. Our full year operating profit growth also reflects our leading generics program, which continues to deliver on the dual mandate of lower cost and product availability. We continue to be pleased with the strength of our scaled and broad oncology platform. This quarter, as Brian mentioned, we expanded into Tennessee with the addition of two practices.', ""With these additions and organic growth, U.S. oncology is now over 2,500 providers. In the Prescription Technology Solution segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 9% to 13%, and we've increased our operating profit growth outlook to 24% to 28%, reflecting strong third quarter performance, continued organic growth, and higher transaction volumes across our access and affordability solutions. The quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment is driven by prescription and transaction volumes. The timing, pace, and trajectory of new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio, and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter."", ""Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment continues to be a leader across all the alternate sites of care. We anticipate revenues to be approximately flat to 4% growth, and operating profit to decrease 11% to 15%. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Our updated outlook incorporates the third quarter results that I discussed earlier, which reflect a modest improvement in sequential primary care traffic. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 29% to 33%, and operating profit to decline by 21% to 26%, reflecting divestitures within McKesson's European business that closed during fiscal 2023. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $615 to $655 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments recorded in the first nine months of the year, and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our business."", 'Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $230 million, and income attributable to non-controlling interests to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million. We anticipate no change to the full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%. The timing of discrete tax item is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we now anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our outlook also incorporates the impact of the October rate of bankruptcy.', 'Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of this share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $134 million. Wrapping up fiscal 2024 guidance, as a result of solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Combined with our momentum, and confidence moving forward, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. We anticipate operating profit will be a 2% decline to 1% growth compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by approximately 8% to 11% year-over-year above the long-term target range.', ""As a reminder, certain items include the following; $1.90 related to fiscal 2023 U.S. Government COVID-19 program and COVID-19 tests in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments. A $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023. And gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024. The increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates growth of 16% to 18% when excluding these certain items. Before I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2025. The momentum we've seen across our business over the past several years is expected to continue in fiscal 2025. We anticipate the U.S. pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solution segments will be more closely aligned to long-term growth targets that we've previously provided for these segments."", ""Demonstrating our leading market positions and stable financial performance. We anticipate that the strength we're seeing across our solution set and prescription technology solutions will lead to growth at the top end or slightly above the long-term target. In U.S. pharmaceutical, we remain confident in our long-term target of 5% to 7% growth. Supported by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and across our oncology platform. The U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute. As the leader in the alternate site market, we believe that the Medical-Surgical Solution segment is well positioned as care continues to move across the alternate site settings. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture the opportunity in the years ahead."", 'We anticipate that the Prescription Technology Solution segment may perform modestly above the long-term growth target of 11% to 12% driven by organic growth as we expand our higher margin biopharma services platform. For the International segment, we anticipate continued growth in our Canadian operations. And throughout fiscal 2023, we completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries that we operated in Europe. As a reminder, Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. And we intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. Finally, we will continue to materially invest in the business on multiple fronts. We will sustain the pace and cadence of investment in product development and enhancements across our oncology and biopharma services platforms.', ""These investments will further our differentiated capabilities and market leading positions. We will also continue to invest in adding capacity and capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation, and regulatory excellence capabilities. And we will continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We see AI as unlocking the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. Although in the early stages, we're using AI to improve patient intake and workflow, improve productivity throughout the system, including automatic clinical note generation, and several supply chain use cases, including supply chain disruption predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms, and fraud detection."", ""Although we're in the early stages of our AI development and implementation, we're committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. To sum up, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business. We're pleased with our strong fiscal 2024 performance, and we remain optimistic about the outlook. McKesson is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term, sustainable growth for all stakeholders. And with that, let's move to our Q&A session."", 'See also 15 States With the Most EV Chargers Per Person and 25 Best Colleges with High Acceptance Rates.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our Chief Executive Officer; and Britt Vitalone, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.

The presentation slides also includes summary of our results for the quarter and updated guidance. With that, let me turn it over to Brian."", 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining our call. McKesson reported a really solid fiscal third quarter, highlighting the continued momentum across the business. We delivered total revenues of $80.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.74, both of which grew by double digits when compared to the prior year. As a result of the recent performance and our latest outlook, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.80 to $27.40 to an updated range of $27.25 to $27.65. This solid financial performance is driven by the focused execution against our company priorities. As a diversified health care services company, we are uniquely positioned to improve health care in every setting. This includes the areas of Oncology and biopharma services. We continue to make significant progress in advancing our strategy and priorities, and I'm pleased to share some of the updates with you today. Let me start where I always like to start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. I start here because it is foundational to everything we do at McKesson. In January, our Board of Directors welcomed Kevin Ozan as a new Independent Director. As the former Chief Financial Officer of McDonald's Corporation, Mr. Ozan has over 2 decades of experience in both strategy and finance and will contribute a valuable perspective to our boardroom. We look forward to his leadership as we work together to deliver on our growth initiatives. Driving the growth of our company requires a talented and diverse leadership team and equally important, a diverse workforce for each individual that is empowered to bring their own opinion, their own ideas and perspectives. Our commitment to best talent and inclusion is reflected in every aspect of our operations. It's how we build a support network for our employees and how we each live these values through everyday interactions. And I'm pleased to see our efforts being recognized. For the 11th consecutive year, McKesson was named as a Military Friendly Employer. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity and a Equality 100 Award winner by the Human Rights Campaign. I'm proud of what we've achieved as a team, and I'm truly grateful to the McKesson employees, who are upholding our culture, values and delivering for all of our stakeholders, our patients, our customers, our partners, our shareholders and importantly, each other. Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth. In the fiscal third quarter, we saw good performance in our distribution businesses. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, adjusted operating profit grew 6%, reflecting broad-based momentum within the segment. We continue to enhance our [scaled] distribution network, improving efficiency through investments in automation and technology. Over the past year, we opened 2 new distribution centers in the U.S. that are equipped with innovative technology and employee-friendly design. These enhancements will enable our facilities to pick, pack and ship medications to customers faster while simultaneously helping to optimize employee productivity levels by reducing redundant tasks. The investments in our foundational distribution assets continue to support the growth of our business and the success of our customers. During the third quarter, we saw solid volume increases across customer channels, which includes distribution to retail national accounts customers. At the consolidated level, prescription volume growth remains stable. Certain product categories, including specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications, continue to grow at a faster pace and contribute as a tailwind to our revenue growth. As a reminder, we anticipate the growth from GLP-1 medications to slow in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the inflection in volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In the Medical-Surgical segment, primary care visits showed modest improvement on a sequential basis after we observed general market moderations last quarter. The improvement was partially driven by overall increase in primary care visits. However, when compared to the prior year, patient visit volumes in the Medical segment remain a headwind to this quarter's performance. In the International segment, our Canadian business continues to perform well. It has a valuable portfolio of assets, including pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies, digital offerings. We're committed to strengthen and grow the business there. And as a part of that commitment, we're executing on a multiyear initiative that will modernize the distribution centers across Canada and deliver significant value to our employees and customers. Let me now continue on to talk about our oncology and biopharma platforms. We continue to build on the foundation of our distribution capabilities, but we have strategically assembled a differentiated set of assets in oncology and biopharma services. Within the oncology business, the U.S. Oncology Network expanded its footprint by entering the state of Tennessee. Over the past quarter, we welcomed 2 new practices, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners, to the network. Through the combination of onboarding new practices and organic growth, the U.S. Oncology Network has grown its provider base to over 2,500, spreading across nearly 600 sites in 30 states. The expansion of the network strengthened our unique market position in community-based oncology practices and demonstrates our strong value proposition to providers. Through the U.S. Oncology Network, we provide a range of comprehensive solutions to ease the administrative and operational burden and to help enable the success of these community practices. In the past quarter, we started integrating new artificial intelligence capabilities into the network, assisting providers with revenue cycle management and evaluating clinical solutions. With the help of AI and machine learning technologies, practices will be able to navigate complex insurance coverage and reimbursement processes more efficiently, allowing providers to spend more time focused on their patients. Within the biopharma services business, we continue to see strong market demand for our differentiated solutions that help improve access, affordability and adherence to medications. In the third quarter -- or this fiscal third quarter, the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered strong performance, primarily driven by the growth in Access Solutions, including prior authorization solutions for branded pharmaceuticals such as GLP-1 medications. Today, we provide prior authorization services for the vast majority of the GLP-1 medications in the market. Our integrated technology streamlines the prior authorization process and helps overcome medication access challenges that patients are facing. The main customers we serve are biopharma companies. And through our scaled network connection, we can electronically process requests both at the pharmacy counter and the providers' offices. The prior authorization solution is an example of the power of our capabilities and as part of a broader portfolio of patient support services we provide. We believe our solutions are highly differentiated and provide value to all stakeholders through a patient's journey. We're connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and approximately 900,000 providers. The scale of our network provides a strong foundation that enables us to reach key stakeholders effectively and seamlessly. The integrated solutions we offer can often be accessed through a single digital entry point. For our biopharma customers, the integration helps streamline workflows and increase transparency into how programs work together. In the past quarter, our team has been working diligently to prepare for what we call the blizzard season. For the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest time of the year due to customer annual verification activities. The annual reset of insurance policies typically drives a large influx of seasonal volumes for many of our programs. Each year, our teams come together to tackle the challenge of these significant volume increases. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver another successful blizzard season that is in line with our expectations. Our products and solutions in both oncology and biopharma Services provide significant value to our customers, as reflected in the continued growth of these businesses. We're excited about the market opportunities in both areas, and we're confident in the scale and depth of our assets and expertise. We will continue to invest and innovate to support the evolving needs of our customers and their patients. So let me pull it all together. McKesson reported another solid quarter in fiscal 2024, that allowed us to raise and narrow our full-year guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share. We're committed to our shareholders to delivering long-term sustainable growth, and this quarter's results reflect the continued progress in delivering on our commitment. Health care is an ever-evolving market. But thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we never stopped finding new ways to drive positive impacts on our customers and their patients. I want to thank the over 50,000 McKesson employees, who are working so tirelessly to advance our mission. And with that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insight and comments."", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our fiscal third quarter 2024 results, which reflect another quarter of solid momentum, with growth across our North American businesses. Our results exceeded expectations, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.Before I turn to our consolidated results, I want to highlight one item that impacted our third quarter GAAP-only results. We recorded an additional pretax GAAP provision for bad debt of $515 million or $381 million after tax, within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. This provision is for uncollected trade accounts receivable from sales to Rite Aid in October of 2023, prior to its bankruptcy petition filing. We continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid through an interim distribution agreement, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're closely monitoring developments. Rite Aid's bankruptcy will not have a material impact on our fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share results. The remainder of my comments will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results. Let me start with a review of the fiscal third quarter. McKesson delivered solid growth in the third quarter, led by sustained strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. This year-over-year growth underscores operating execution across our diversified and differentiated portfolio, including investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of the third quarter operating performance and our confidence in the business, we're increasing and narrowing our full-year outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. Let me move to our consolidated results. Revenues increased 15% to $80.9 billion, led by continued strong utilization trends, growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures within McKesson's European business. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%. Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 3%. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, and the impact from the U.S. government COVID-19 programs in fiscal 2023, gross profit increased 10%. Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter due to higher costs to support growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Third quarter operating profit decreased 9% to $1.3 billion. Fiscal 2023 results included a pretax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. government COVID-19 programs, which were mitigated by contributions from commercial COVID-19 distribution and a nonrecurring $30 million charge in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. These items were partially offset by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Prescription Technology Solutions segment. When adjusting for these items, including $126 million or $0.65 benefit from the early termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 7% in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense was $58 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year, driven by effective management of our loan portfolio. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%, resulting from the recognition of discrete tax benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 133.3 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. Consolidated third quarter earnings per diluted share was $7.74, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior year. This increase includes the impacts of approximately $0.63 related to the U.S. government COVID-19 program and the $0.65 benefit from the termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and increased commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution and a nonrecurring charge in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2024. Turning to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slide 7 through 11, and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. During the quarter, we experienced volume increases across all product categories and customer channels. Specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications continue to grow at a faster pace compared to the prior year. Third quarter revenues were $73 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $2.8 billion or 60%, compared to fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we also noted increased contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In our fiscal third quarter, commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution peaked in October, then declined significantly in November and December. We do not anticipate material contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the third quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $828 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Adjusting for the impact of the U.S. government COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023 and commercial COVID-19 distribution in fiscal 2024 and the $30 million nonrecurring charge in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, delivered operating profit growth of 8% year-over-year. In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications and new brand launches led to increased demand for our access solutions, such as prior authorization services. For the third quarter, revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, and operating profit increased 25% to $193 million. Third quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes, which drove higher demand for our access solutions, principally prior authorization services and growth in our third-party logistics business. In addition to the strength of prior authorization services, year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%, primarily driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, partially offset by anticipated lower contributions in the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program, compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, primary care patient visits moderately increased on a sequential basis. Demand for commercialized COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the alternate sites of care that we serve, was also modestly higher compared to prior expectations. The overall illness season dynamics, including vaccinations and testing, continue to be an operating profit headwind in the quarter when compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique, depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Operating profit was $282 million, a decrease of 16%, driven by anticipated lower contributions from the kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and a softer illness season as compared to fiscal 2023. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses. Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 18% year-over-year, driven by divestitures with McKesson's European business, partially offset by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in Canada. Operating profit was $105 million, a decrease of 27%, driven by divestitures within the McKesson's European business. Wrapping up our segment review, Corporate expenses were $147 million in the quarter, which included losses of $8 million or $0.05 per share, related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio. McKesson Ventures impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter-to-quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments has been resulted in gains and losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. We remain pleased with the insights and the results that we're obtaining through this portfolio. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, Corporate expenses in the third quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. Turning now to cash flows and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $100 million in the third quarter and $2.9 billion for the trailing 12 months. Third quarter free cash flow was impacted by the Rite Aid bankruptcy in October and its associated $725 million provision for bad debts. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on and therefore, can vary from quarter-to-quarter. During the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we made capital expenditure investments of $418 million, which included new and existing distribution centers, as well as investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year-to-date, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $2.3 billion of share repurchases and $232 million in dividend payments. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation. Let me start with the fiscal 2024 outlook for our segments. For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 18% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11% to 14%. And the impact of elevated commercial COVID-19 distribution in the third quarter net of $30 million nonrecurring charge, also in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, accounts for approximately 2% of segment growth. The updated segment revenue outlook incorporates the strong third quarter performance and continued growth in specialty distribution, supported by stable utilization trends. Revenue growth assumes that GLP-1 medication volumes will continue to be robust, although the rate of growth will moderate in our fiscal fourth quarter. These medications are lower margins and represent a headwind to year-over-year operating profit growth. Our full-year operating profit growth also reflects our leading Generics program, which continues to deliver on the dual mandate of lower cost and product availability. And we continue to be pleased with the strength of our scaled and broad oncology platform. This quarter, as Brian mentioned, we expanded into Tennessee with the addition of 2 practices. With these additions and organic growth, U.S. oncology has now over 2,500 providers. In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 9% to 13%, and we've increased our operating profit growth outlook to 24% to 28%, reflecting strong third quarter performance, continued organic growth and higher transaction volumes across the access and affordability solutions. The quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment is driven by prescription and transaction volumes, the timing, pace and trajectory of new product drug launches, the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers, that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment continues to be a leader across all the alternate sites of care. We anticipate revenues to be approximately flat to 4% growth and operating profit to decrease 11% to 15%. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 6% to 8% year-over-year. Our updated outlook incorporates the third quarter results that I discussed earlier, which reflect a modest improvement in sequential primary care traffic. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 29% to 33% and operating profit to decline by 21% to 26%, reflecting divestitures within McKesson's European business that closed during fiscal 2023. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $615 million to $655 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments recorded in the first 9 months of the year and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our business. Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $230 million and income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million. We anticipate no change to the full year effective tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%. The timing of discrete tax item is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment. We now anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of the quarter. Our outlook also incorporates the impact of the October Rite Aid bankruptcy. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 134 million. Wrapping up fiscal 2024 guidance. As a result of solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, combined with our momentum and confidence moving forward, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. We anticipate operating profit will be a 2% decline to 1% growth compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by approximately 8% to 11% year-over-year, above the long-term target range. As a reminder, certain items include the following: $1.90 related to fiscal 2023 U.S. government COVID-19 program and COVID-19 tests in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical Surgical segments, a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024. The increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates growth of 16% to 18%, when excluding these certain items. Before I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2025. The momentum we've seen across our business over the past several years is expected to continue in fiscal 2025. We anticipate U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments will be more closely aligned to the long-term growth targets that we've previously provided for these segments, demonstrating our leading market positions and stable financial performance. We anticipate that the strength we're seeing across our solution set in Prescription Technology Solutions will lead to growth at the top end or slightly above the long-term target. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, we remain confident in our long-term target of 5% to 7% growth, supported by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and across our oncology platform, the U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada and the joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute. As the leader in the alternate site market, we believe that the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment is well positioned as care continues to move across the alternate site settings. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture the growth opportunity in the years ahead. We anticipate that the Prescription Technology Solutions segment may perform modestly above the long-term growth target of 11% to 12%, driven by organic growth, as we expand our higher-margin biopharma services platform. For the International segment, we anticipate continued growth in our Canadian operations. And throughout fiscal 2023, we completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries that we operated in Europe. As a reminder, Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. And we intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. Finally, we will continue to materially invest in the business on multiple fronts. We will sustain the pace and cadence of investment in product development and enhancements across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will further our differentiated capabilities and market-leading positions. We will also continue to invest in adding capacity and capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation and regulatory excellence capabilities. And we will continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence. We see AI as unlocking the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. Although in the early stages, we're using AI to improve patient intake and workflow, improve productivity throughout the system, including automatic clinical note generation, and several supply chain use cases, including supply chain disruption predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms and fraud detection.Although we're in the early stages of our AI development and implementation, we're committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. To sum up, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business. We're pleased with our strong fiscal 2024 performance, and we remain optimistic about the outlook. McKesson is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results as we successfully executed against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders. And with that, let's move to our Q&A session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.', 'Charles Rhyee', ""Obviously, strong performance in RxTS, as implied in the guidance. Maybe you can kind of give us a feel for the mix between reauthorizations versus new prior auths in that mix. And as we think about through the course of the year as kind of new category, like this is sort of a category that's kind of grown significantly over the last year or so, particularly and if we think about the launch of [Zedan] as well from Lilly, can you give us a sense of what the life cycle typically is for prior auths? Over time as products mature, what does that activity look like? And maybe give us a sense for what you kind of expect right now, particularly in this -- the GLP-1 category?"", 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Thanks, Charles. I'll start. And Britt, as always, feel free to add on. First off, we're very pleased with the solutions that we have in this segment. We think the growth over last several quarters demonstrates the value that they bring to providers. Just as a reminder, this segment, new brand launches of particularly high-cost drugs are for this segment. They typically require prior authorization. We have automated solutions there. So as those volumes grow, that's generally good for this business. The GLP-1s were a strong contributor in the current quarter. How the programs evolve will largely be dependent on payer decisions, in terms of how frequently they require an authorization or a reauthorization. But certainly, it's been a good tailwind for us. And as for the blizzard season, I'm pleased to say it played out in accordance to how we expected it to. It's a lot of work. The team really put their head down, had a good plan and is pushing through that work, and we're very confident we'll end this blizzard season more or less in line with our expectations at the outset of the year."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research.', 'Eric R. Percher', ""Thank you. I appreciate the '25 initial commentary, and I wanted to focus in on specialty. I thought coming out of the pandemic, we saw elevated growth, and you're calling out higher growth this year. And I'd like to understand how much of that is organic growth versus gaining of share and beyond oncology, an increase of share in multi-specialty? And then finally, I'd ask for those practices you're acquiring now, I think you've known them for quite some time, what is it that's driving them to join today?"", 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Let me start. I guess I'll start where you ended with the practices. First thing I think I would say is we are very pleased with the solid growth in our same store. We can obviously grow our U.S. Oncology Network in multiple ways, we can add -- we could add oncologists or providers to an existing practice that we have. We could greenfield a new practice. We did onboard new practices. And really, we've been benefiting over the last few years from all 3 of those. We have been very pleased with our ability to attract new members to the U.S. Oncology Network. We've added, I don't know, 500 or 600 providers over the last couple of years. We've entered into -- we added 6 new practices and 8 new geographies over the calendar year of 2023. Why are we able to do that? We think it's not just great practice management, we've been at this for 15 years, so we've got a leading EMR, we've got leading technologies. Britt talked about investments we're making to extend that lead. But I think, we also have this broad ecosystem that includes Ontada, which helps us provide insights to our providers. It includes SCRI, which brings in clinical research and trial capabilities. And so we think it's that really broad value proposition, Eric, which allows us to compel the growth we're seeing in the U.S. Oncology Network today."", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""And Eric, maybe I'll just add on, when we think about specialty product growth, we're certainly seeing specialty product growth across not only our largest customers, but across, as I mentioned, health systems. And certainly, as we continue to grow the U.S. Oncology Network and oncology in general, we're certainly seeing more growth in that area as well. So we're seeing growth in specialty products. We're seeing growth across the specialty providers that we service. And as I mentioned, we're also seeing significant growth from GLP-1 medication. So we're really [winning] across the entirety of our scaled business. And of course, as our customers continue to win, that's reflected in the volume increases also."", 'Operator', 'Next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.', 'Lisa Christine Gill', ""I just want to go to your International business, and you talked about how strong Canada is, but there's been some speculation in the marketplace around Rexall. Can you talk about the strategy in Canada and specific to owning a drug retail?"", 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Well, I won't comment, obviously, on rumors. Let me say this about Canada. We have a very scaled, broad and impactful health care services business there. It's obviously anchored in our distribution assets, but it includes specialty distribution capabilities. It includes retail pharmacies. It includes one of the best online brands in [Well.ca]. It includes infusion clinics, and it includes a growing biopharma manufacturer services business. So we're very, very broad in our capabilities and really one of the leading players in the Canadian health care landscape in general. We've been very pleased with the performance of the business. Britt talked about some of the investments we continue to make into that business to keep our growth trajectory going. And I'd say, we just -- we're very pleased with the performance and very committed to the current strategy."", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""The only thing I would add is similar to our U.S. business, in Canada, we have very strong strategic sourcing capabilities as well, which our customers benefit from. And it's helping our customers win and helping us drive increased distribution volume. So very similar to the U.S., we utilized our strong scaled strategic sourcing capabilities to help our customers win."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America.', 'Allen Charles Lutz', 'Britt, you mentioned core operating expense growth was about 6%, excluding divestitures. As we think about the current growth across your different businesses, is that 6% growth rate the right way to think about operating expense growth from here? And then is there any reason why that would take higher or lower versus that 6%?', 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""Thanks for the question, Allen. I think when you look at our operating expenses, what we tried to do and what we've been able to do over a long period of time is gain leverage on our gross profit. And so what we strive to do and we've demonstrated is that our operating expenses typically will grow at a slower pace than gross profit. Now we've been investing back in the business. And so as we've been investing not only in distribution capabilities, data and analytics and now an accelerated investment in artificial intelligence, quarterly variability in that operating expense number, you can expect to see that. But generally speaking, you will see us generate operating leverage on our gross margin."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.', 'Brian Gil Tanquilut', ""Maybe, Britt, just curious, what you're seeing on the Generic pricing front and what opportunities we should be thinking about, as we think about a combination of drug shortages and just broader inflation trends in Generic?"", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. In Generics, we continue to have a very scaled sourcing operation in ClarusONE. ClarusONE continues to partner very closely with our broad set of customers, is generating good sourcing and benefits. I talked about the dual mandate that we focus on, which is driving low cost positions for our customers. At the same time, it's driving the highest availability of supply. We've been able to do that over a long period of time. Our Generics business continues to grow. And we're quite pleased with the sourcing spread that we're able to generate from our sourcing -- buy-side capabilities. And we think that our customers are benefiting as well, and we see that in high compliance rate. So it's been a competitive but stable marketplace in the Generic space. But the capabilities that we have on sourcing, the ability for us to drive lower cost and high availability of product and generate spread for our customers in a disciplined way, that has proven to be a good formula for us over a long period of time."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS.', 'Kevin Caliendo', ""I appreciate the color on the Rite Aid impact. I'm guessing my question is, I know we don't know exactly what's going to happen with the rest of Rite Aid, we should hopefully know soon. But what are the assumptions built in for fiscal '25 around the potential impact from whatever happens with Rite Aid from here? Like is it built in, in your comments and how meaningful can it be?"", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""I appreciate the question. I obviously can't -- am not in a position to comment a lot on Rite Aid. What I can tell you is what we've talked about for fiscal 2024. And Rite Aid is not going to have a material impact on our financial results. So I would leave it at that. In terms of 2025, we'll learn more over the next few months. We'll give you more information as we give you further information on all of our fiscal 2025 assumptions. But Rite Aid is not material to our financial results in fiscal 2024."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird.', 'Eric White Coldwell', ""This one, I think, is fairly obvious and fairly simple, but I just want to make sure. The free cash flow reduction versus prior guide, is that specifically and only due to the Rite Aid impact? And if so, I guess the question is why you didn't take that last quarter, perhaps when -- I guess, maybe that's not a fair question given the timing, but I just want to make sure that's the only topic there. And then on the repo activity as well, slightly lower outlook here, $3 billion to $3.5 billion versus prior 3.5. Is that also the Rite Aid impact or perhaps due to valuation in the market or some other topic? Those are my only two."", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""Yes, I appreciate the question, Eric. And you'll note that in our free cash flow guide for the rest of the year, the reduction versus the prior guidance that we gave you is not the full impact of the Rite Aid provision for bad debt. So it is a key driver to that. So to answer your question very simply, yes, Rite Aid and the bankruptcy is a driver on free cash flow reduction. In terms of share repo, I'd say that there's two things that are driving that. Clearly, we are taking a look at our free cash flow guide. But going back to our principles of how we deploy capital, one of the things that we've talked about is, a, we will buy back shares when cash -- there's excess cash on hand that we can't deploy in a growth format. And secondly, we're going to be looking at the intrinsic value of the stock. We want to be in the market, and we want to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, but those two factors are going to be important to us. And so we're going to continue to be disciplined. And so a portion of that is reflected in the lower share buyback."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays.', 'Stephanie July Davis', ""I was -- I know you've given a lot of great color on this, but I was hoping we could date a little bit more into the strong U.S. Pharmaceutical growth and how to think about the lighter flow through the margin, is there anything beyond GLP-1s kind of doing that? And you made a comment on commercial COVID net of $30 million nonrecurring accounting for some of the growth that we saw. Could you clarify kind of any impact that would have on the margin flow-through?"", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""Yes. So let me comment on a couple of things. We're really pleased with our U.S. Pharmaceutical results. They delivered another strong quarter. Included in that, obviously, we are lapping the effects of the government program, the COVID last year. This year, we do have commercial COVID vaccines, that peaked in October, and then it really fell off. We did have a onetime nonrecurring charge in the quarter. When you net the commercial COVID vaccine contribution in that chart, it roughly offsets the government program contribution from last year. So the performance within this segment is just strong continued utilization that we're seeing in the marketplace, continued strong growth of specialty across all of our customer channels and the continued growth in our Oncology business, as well as -- as I mentioned, I provided a number on the revenue impact from GLP-1s, which again come at a lower margin rate and have been a headwind to year-over-year. So just sort of sum up, it's just continued strong utilization in the marketplace in general, continued good growth of our customers and channels and continued growth within our oncology business."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.', 'Erin Elizabeth Wilson Wright', 'So if I think about 2025, why is 5% to 7% still the right growth target for U.S. Pharma, just given the specialty contributions and growth there and favorable Generics environment? And just do you think kind of the long-term growth has inflected higher at this point for longer? Or what are some of those offsets that we should be thinking about in 2025?', 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""Appreciate the question. Let me just start by stating that at the beginning of the year, when we gave guidance. The long-term growth rate for the segment was 4% to 6%. Given the performance that we've seen this year, we increased that target, that long-term target rate, to 5% to 7%. What I'm trying to provide you now is an early view into some of the qualitative factors that we're looking at and some of the momentum that we see going forward. And indicating that long-term range that we increased this year, we still see that as being the right number today. Now we'll continue to do some analysis, some work, and we come forward with our full-year assumptions, we'll give you more insight into that. But just as a reminder, we have already increased the long-term target range this year from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7% on. And we're certainly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the segment."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi.', 'Daniel R. Grosslight', 'One of your competitors mentioned that there may be an ability to renegotiate GLP-1 contracts as they come due, to potentially extract a bit more margin for the drug supply chain. I was wondering if you could comment on your views of contract negotiations as those contracts renew and if there may be an ability to boost the margin profile of GLP-1s, going forward?', 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Well, I would say this, I think we've talked many times on these calls that first most important thing for us to do is make sure we get fair value for the services that we provide. And then obviously, we want to provide as many services as we can in support of those products. And that philosophy is no different for the GLP-1 class than it is, frankly, for all of the products that we distribute. So, we are always in close contact and communication with our biopharma partners to talk about the value that we deliver, to talk about maybe the ancillary services that we could offer in support of those programs and to find ways that we can both support the growth of our respective businesses. And that's exactly the lens we'll bring to this product class, and it's really no different than the way we run the business day to day."", 'Operator', 'And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.', 'Elizabeth Hammell Anderson', 'You guys talked about continuing to invest in some of the longer-term drivers of the pharma growth in terms of oncology, biopharma services, et cetera. I was hoping you could unpack that a little bit more and sort of talk a bit more about where you sort of see the most attractive opportunities versus the assets that you already have?', 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Sure, I'll start, and Britt can tack on. First thing I would say is, I'm really pleased -- over the last several years, we have been very discipline in making sure that we made organic investment or reinvestment back into the business. And we view that as part of good portfolio management. I mean, our goal is to continue to extend the growth that we see in our markets and to innovate -- innovating new solutions as part of that.So [across now], we allocate that investment capital, certainly, some goes into the core, where we think we can get efficiency, better services, extend our base value proposition. But a lot will go into, we call, our growth pillars, and that would be oncology. So in one instance, we've talked a lot about greenfielding our Ontada business or our data and analytics business. Obviously, we've gone inorganic with SCRI and extended into clinical trials and research, talked about a quarter or 2 ago about some innovations that we've made in RxTS segment and enhancing some of our solutions and frankly, building and innovating and bringing new solutions. So it's much like our inorganic investment. We are tied to our strategy and committed to business cases that we think will deliver more returns. I think the one area that we probably highlighted more this quarter than we have in the past is investments in technology, AI, machine learning. Obviously, that -- the developments and advancements in that field has come on fast. And when you think about a business that operates at our kind of scale, we're very excited about the opportunities we see there. And when you think about like the U.S. oncology, Britt highlighted several places where we think we can use this kind of technology to make a better patient experience, make our provider experience better and to continue to drive efficiencies through that business. So, we will continue to be committed to investing back in the business, where we see good financial returns tied to our strategy."", 'Operator', 'And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank.', 'George Robert Hill', 'Britt, first one is just kind of a point of clarification. When you say GLP-1 as an EBIT headwind, you mean to margins not to dollars? And then for Brian, I have a follow-up question on oncology. I guess, could you just kind of talk about the greenfield opportunity that remains in the USO business? And do you think more about the opportunity to add providers, kind of add regions or add services into the installed base as kind of the way to continue to grow that business?', 'Brian S. Tyler', ""I'll start with your second question, and then Britt can come on. So I talked about three ways to drive the U.S. oncology business. One is to acquire a practice in a geography we're not in, obviously, to add providers to an existing geography. And in instances where our criteria are met, meaning we think we can attract the right level of scale, we can find oncologists that want to practice consistent with the way we practice oncology in our network; we are not afraid to greenfield. Obviously, adding to an existing is faster, acquiring an established practice that we feel fits our criteria is probably second, and greenfield would be third. But we have all those avenues open to us. And so we look at the criteria, the population, the growth, the payer mix, these all kind of go into our formula as we identify which of those three avenues is the most viable."", 'Britt J. Vitalone', ""And the answer to your first question is we've talked about GLP-1s previously and today, we are talking about margin rate. They usually come at a lower margin rate than other products that we distribute.

That question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Carol on for Steve. Just a follow-up on the Prescription Technology segment of GLP-1. Now that we're starting to come up against some harder comps. Just how should we think about growth for this business tied to [renewed] versus new prescriptions? And what are some of the other categories we should be focused on as growth drivers outside of GLP-1?"", 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Well, I think as we think about GLP-1s, obviously, 4 quarters ago, it was a big growth quarter, we're going to start to lap that. I think my characterization is there will continue to be growth. That growth may or may not be linear, depending on product launches, uptakes how commercial, government, other payers adopt policies to manage these products. So I think it's going to be growth, it's going to be slowed compared to what it has been historically, and it's probably going to be a little bit lumpier than we would typically expect just because of the size of the class."", 'Britt J. Vitalone', 'And I would just remind you that while the growth has been robust and we do expect the rate of growth to moderate as we go to future quarters beginning in the fourth quarter, we did increase the guide for the operating profit for the segment.

Prior authorizations in general, GLP-1 specifically, but also seeing good growth across other access and affordability solutions within this segment.', 'Brian S. Tyler', ""Well, thank you again, everyone, for joining our call. I appreciate, as always, the great questions. I want to thank you, Cynthia, for facilitating the call.

In this arrangement, you commit to paying premiums, and in return, the insurance company protects against financial losses resulting from accidents or damage to your vehicle. By paying a premium, you secure an agreement with the insurance company, and they commit to covering your losses as specified in your policy. These policies are tailored to individual needs and budgets, allowing you to customize coverage amounts accordingly. Typically, policy terms span six or twelve months and are renewable. The insurance provider will inform you when it's time to renew your policy and submit another premium payment."", ""In most US states, it's a legal requirement to have car insurance. If you cause a car accident, the auto liability coverage mandated by your insurance helps cover certain expenses. This includes the other party's medical bills and the repair or replacement of their vehicle or property damaged in the accident. Additionally, this coverage assists in paying for your legal fees if you end up in court due to the accident."", ""Many drivers get car insurance because it's a legal requirement, but it's not just about meeting the minimum coverage. There are several reasons to consider having car insurance. It serves as a financial safeguard for you and your family, preventing significant expenses. By investing a modest amount now, you can avoid hefty costs in the future. Quality car insurance provides protection for you, your family, passengers, and other drivers. In the event of an accident, having the right coverage ensures that you're financially prepared for property damage or bodily injury expenses. Dealing with the aftermath of a car accident can be time-consuming and tiresome. With proper coverage, you can sidestep the hassle of negotiating with other parties involved, managing repair or replacement costs for your vehicle, and handling various headaches that may arise. A comprehensive auto insurance policy not only assists with towing, repairs, and replacements for your vehicle but also covers damages to other drivers."", 'This year, auto insurance rates have seen another increase, and an expert attributes it to a combination of factors, including the higher costs of cars and parts, as well as a growing number of accidents.

Speaking on the matter, Holeman stated, “That litigation has a direct impact on insurance premiums. There are these high-dollar rewards in court cases. That’s going to be passed along to consumers.” He also highlighted that the prevalence of more technologically advanced cars on the roads is contributing to the overall increase in insurance prices. According to Holeman, insurance companies are incurring $1.12 in expenses for every $1 of premium written, essentially paying out more than they are taking in. He noted that the persistently high rates of accidents will likely keep insurance rates elevated in the foreseeable future.', ""According to auto insurance processing company CCC Intelligent Solutions, the average repair cost for a traditional vehicle currently stands at $4,437. For electric vehicles, the average repair expense is 49% higher at $6,618. This increase is attributed to the additional technological components in electric vehicles and the specialized handling required for their electric powertrains. Insurers have responded to the surge in repair costs, witnessing a 64% rise in the average collision insurance claim from 2018 to 2022, reaching $5,992 according to the Insurance Information Institute. To counteract the escalating repair expenses, insurance providers have significantly increased drivers' premiums.

Level 2 chargers can charge an EV battery 6 to 8 times faster than charging from a wall outlet, often referred to as a Level 1 charger. Level 3 chargers, often referred to as Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC), can charge a typical EV battery in less than one hour.', 'More than half of all rebate funding is reserved to help boost EV investment in equity-eligible communities, and with higher levels of rebates reserved for customers located in, driving, or doing business in low-income and equity-eligible communities.', '""Under Governor Pritzker’s leadership, the state of Illinois is leading an EV revolution, delivering incentives and enabling significant expansion of our EV charging network so more residents can take advantage of environmental and air quality benefits of zero emissions vehicles,"" said Megha Lakhchaura, EV Officer for the state of Illinois. ""ComEd’s new EV programs complement state and federal incentives designed to boost EV adoption and charging buildout on a larger scale. This means more school districts, transit agencies, local governments and small and large businesses and their surrounding communities can access the benefits of EVs.""', 'Specifically, funding amounts and eligibility for the two new ComEd rebate programs for business and public sector customers to support large-scale EV adoption are as follows:', 'A total of $57M is available in 2024 for EV Purchase RebatesRebates between $5,000-$180,000 each, with funding not to exceed the cost of the vehicle.

Rebates can cover project make-ready costs including, but not limited to, contractor labor, conduits, cable, fasteners and breakers. Rebates will not cover the cost of the physical charger. This rebate can also be applied retroactively in some cases; ComEd will accept applications for qualifying projects completed as far back as June 1, 2023.', 'New investments to accelerate EV adoption in the region complement statewide plans to boost EV adoption in Illinois – a key focus as part of the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which sets a goal of putting 1 million EVs on state roads by 2030. EV ownership has increased in recent years, with 80,000 vehicles driving in northern Illinois today, up from just 17,000 in 2019. ComEd programs build on state and federal programs designed to reduce upfront costs to vehicle purchase, and to reduce range anxiety through the expansion of a network of charging serving more communities.', 'The new rebate programs announced today are geared toward business and public sector customers, including:', 'Those who are considering electrifying their fleet to improve their environmental footprint while reducing their fuel and operating costs.', 'Those who are looking to offer charging access to their customers and communities.', 'The programs will accept applications from a broad range of business and public sector customers, including small and large businesses, local government, school districts, and transit authorities.', '""ComEd’s investments to expand EV adoption will support our regional efforts to address climate change and enhance air quality by reducing tailpipe emissions,"" said Kevin Burns, Metropolitan Mayors Caucus Chairman of the Executive Board, Environmental Committee and Energy Subcommittee.

Not only do they offer fuel and maintenance cost savings and performance benefits, but communities can experience broad environmental improvements from reduced tailpipe emissions. Additionally, electrifying transportation—including cars, trucks, school buses and public transit fleets—can create tangible health benefits for all communities and families across northern Illinois, especially communities which have traditionally borne the brunt of climate change and air pollution.', '""The Environmental Law & Policy Center is especially encouraged that school districts can get ComEd assistance with electric school buses and charging equipment,"" said Susan Mudd, Senior Policy Advocate at the Environmental Law & Policy Center. ""This is an equity issue as more low-income families rely upon bus transportation to safely get their children to and from school than higher-income families. We know that electric school buses provide a zero-emission ride to and from school, which means children are not exposed to asthma-inducing fumes. The quieter electric buses also mean students arrive at school calmer and more ready to learn.""', '""ComEd’s ongoing commitment to advancing electrification is vital for reducing carbon emissions, improving health, and creating financial benefits for all communities in Illinois,"" said Nate Baguio, Senior Vice President of Commercial Development at Lion Electric.

With that, I will turn the call over to Stephanie."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone joining today's call. Let me begin by saying that despite a challenging retail environment and consumer buying behavior that was inconsistent market to market we are pleased with the results we achieved in our third quarter, with revenue in line with our November outlook and better-than-expected earnings.As I approach my first year at Under Armour, I am genuinely inspired by the power of the brand and our commitment to the strategies we are undertaking to unlock our full potential. Following our Protect This House 3 plan launched last spring, I am pleased with our progress in driving global demand creation and our focus on evolving and simplifying our approach to connecting with consumers.I also feel good about how our efforts are shaping up to deliver elevated design and products to the athletes we serve in nearly 100 countries around the world, strengthening our ability to drive success across our largest growth opportunities in footwear, sports style and our women's business. With respect to driving U.S. sales, this remains a multiyear journey. And candidly, we have much more work to do to become a healthier business capable of returning to growth in our largest market.As detailed previously, inconsistency has permeated our U.S. business over the past years in how we go to market across consumers, customers and geographies, how our product is created and delivered with a consistent design language, channel segmentation and how we show up in our owned physical and digital businesses. With a critical mass of work underway, an additional analysis that will yield more work and decision points in the months ahead, we are on right path to addressing these inconsistencies and turning them into strength.All of this will take time, and it starts with leadership. To drive success, the right talent must be in the right places with the trust and the freedom necessary to empower execution. Bolstering our leadership was amongst my highest priorities in my first year at UA, and we've made excellent progress. Since last summer, we've added several new experienced officers to lead our product, design, consumer, supply chain and communications teams.Additionally, we named a 9-year company veteran to lead our Americas region and announced the return of the UA veteran to head our EMEA business. We have also streamlined our business to be more responsive, including our marketing functions, where we recently consolidated our global and North American teams who will report to a new Chief Marketing Officer, a search that's currently underway. This unification will bring a cleaner integrated approach to empower faster decision-making to accelerate our ability to connect more deeply with consumers.About 2/3 of my executive leadership team is new compared to last year and each of these leadership changes is tied directly to the inconsistencies I mentioned earlier. So we are making good progress and hitting challenges head on. The next steps are activating and empowering these teams to drive our strategic priorities, creating a future flywheel of operational excellence and execution that drives consistency back into our business.During the third quarter, I visited our Asia Pacific region and met with our team, athletes and retail and factory partners. Like my EMEA trip, I am encouraged by the energy, passion and effort we're bringing to our daily business. I also toured many of our North American stores to evaluate the opportunities we have to leverage our full-price locations as a premium brand showcase to further build relevance with our consumers.In the near to midterm, as we navigate a dynamic global environment, and our new leaders take time to ramp up we are focused on cost management and profitability, as we close out fiscal '24 and assess how to best to allocate our investments in the year ahead. This includes efforts to understand where and how we are putting our resources to work to drive the best possible returns and identifying which strategies will be most critical to driving demand creation over the long term, especially in North America.With more strategic deployment of our marketing resources, we continue to see positive momentum here. A great example is the Curry Brand, driven by the Curry 11 basketball shoe. And we recently launched the Dub Nation pack celebrating Stephen's commitment to the Golden State Warriors fans with unique colorways for the 11, the Curry 1 Retro and the Spawn FloTro. The Curry Brand also dropped exciting collaborations with Bruce Lee and apparel and footwear, including the new Curry SlipSpeed. And with the addition of De'Aaron Fox from the Sacramento Kings, we're looking forward to De'Aaron's first signature shoe later this year. In Global Football, we're leveling up our roster with some of the best up-and-coming talent at the highest levels of sport. We recently signed Mexican national team players, Sebastian Cordova, FC Barcelona's Fermín López and Real Madrid's Antonio Rüdiger. As we look to grow relevance in the world's most popular sport, this marks a significant move to bolster our presence. So we are very excited about the possibilities this brings in the years ahead. In American football, I want to congratulate our hometown Baltimore Ravens for a fantastic season, reaching the AFC championship game, including UA Athlete, Kyle Hamilton, who was named a first team All Pro and to the Pro Bowl in just a second year. On the college side of the game, (inaudible) finish this season with a dominant ball win powered by Under Armour performance gear on the field and had off the field Swagger with UA SlipSpeed, Heat Gear base layer, hoodies and fleece. Adding an excellent example of our evolving approach to brand activation, was last month's UA Next All-American event in Orlando. We're the best U.S. high school volleyball and football players engaged in a week of unforgettable experiences and elite level competition.As a Pinnacle Grassroots program, this provides the next generation of athletes an opportunity to elevate their physical and mental game. And of course, they were kitted out an amazing UA gear, like the all-new SlipSpeed Mega, a maximalist running shoe in Fire and Ice colorways and other products like Unstoppable pants, Infinite Pro running shoes and all the accessories necessary to excel at their sport.With a massive social media activation, the UA Next All-American week demonstrates how we maximize the authentic connection to sports culture showcasing product innovations that make athletes better and leveraging up-and-coming influencers to generate brand buzz and engagement. We have also made significant strides across social media over the past year and continue to gain traction. During this time, our Instagram followers showed strength across all UA accounts with a significant uptick in the Curry Brand.Likewise, our TikTok followers have also gotten stronger as have our engagement rates. This past quarter, our focus was elevating footwear and sports style and our strategic collaboration with external content creators and influencers meaningfully helped to amplify the impact of our social media content. To drive engagement and demand for the brand, we must deliver elevated design and products. With the appointment of Yassine Saidi as our Chief Product Officer, I am incredibly excited about the evolution and style for our apparel and footwear.Joining us just last week Yassine brings nearly 20 years of industry experience from several powerhouse brands with a deep pedigree in developing authentic performance and sportswear apparel and a reputation as a significant influencer in the sneaker market.With our Chief Product Officer and a new Head of Design in place, along with additional apparel, sneaker and branding experts, we are making significant progress in getting the right team together to ensure a balanced approach to continuing to deliver industry-leading performance innovations on pitch, field and court with an ability to attack the massive sports sell opportunity more effectively.Given our product creation cycle, it will take time for this newly led team to start driving more critical mass into the equation, yet we're not hitting pause until then. We have a lot of newness to be excited about as we head into spring, summer '24, especially in apparel. Over the past few quarters, we've made substantial progress in style consolidation and leaning into premium as we started to place smaller run capsules and reposition existing products within our Sportstyle offering.Although early, we are excited for fresh updates of our key apparel franchises to hit shelves later this spring, including the Unstoppable Air Vent, a new bag year on-trend silhouette of our classic woven pants. Additionally, an expanded line of our soft and versatile Meridian performance apparel is due out this spring. With stylist flattering products for women, including body suits and tanks that she can wear from the classroom to practice and from the gym to the office. Next is an update to our iconic warm weather base layer with super light heat gear compression shirts and shorts that wick sweat from maximum performance, receiving new and improved fits, colorways and styles for more versatile occasions.Our retail partners are excited about this evolution and bookings for this product are strong, especially our women's products. Speaking of our women's business, we were honored to have received 2 Women's Health Fitness Magazine awards. Our UA SmartFarm Evolution mid sports bra received the best sports bra overall and our Women's UA Reign 6 training footwear was also recognized. We are proud of these wins, which help drive more incredible momentum in this business, especially as we expand our Sportstyle offerings. Shifting to our ability to harness innovation for our athletes in the planet, I'd highlight our collaboration with Celanese, a global chemical and materials company in developing a new fiber for performance stretch fabrics called Neolast. This incredibly innovative fiber has the potential to offer our industry a high-performing, more sustainable alternative to elastane or spandex, which has recycling challenges.With the first apparel products due out later this year, we believe Neolast fiber could have a transformative impact on Under Armour in the textile industry. Next is footwear, which remains our single most significant growth opportunity, and we know we have a lot of work to do here. During the third quarter, our footwear business was down 7% in part due to a tougher prior year growth comparison of 25%, but also due to softer demand, primarily in North America.In the rearview, we recognized some of the inconsistencies from our past are showing up in our current results. However, we believe these challenges are near term in nature, and we continue to look forward by evolving our footwear strategies and investments to support our long-term growth expectations. Rounding out our product leadership changes, a search for a new head of footwear is also underway, further emphasizing our commitment to having the right talent to drive the right results in the years ahead.Leveraging our knowledge of knits, expertise in midsoles and innovative cushioning, we have made good headway in our approach to our running footwear. As a highlight, our Velociti and Infinite running franchises are getting important updates for spring/summer '24 with base, pro and elite styles to cover our good, better, best segmentation. In this spirit, we are intensely focused on franchises identifying where we can land and partnering with our wholesale customers to scale our footwear business more effectively. Shifting next to our Americas business and much work remains. During the third quarter, our North American business was down 12%, which I will note was in line with our expectations and reflective of a challenging wholesale environment in the U.S. and softer demand. Here, we remain focused on serving our retail partners and working with them to optimize our assortment and segmentation, ensuring greater overall consistency and profitability.In our North American DTC business, I'd highlight that underneath flattish results in the quarter, we are encouraged by specific operational gains made during the crucial holiday period. These included exceptional customer service scorecards, elevated talent across our fleet and significantly improved in-stock levels. Thus, our work to become a better retailer is beginning to shine through.We are also progressing on our new full-price brand house design and are set to test a smaller, easier- to-navigate format with a more premium and curated product positioning. One of the bright spots for our North American DTC business continues to be our UA Rewards Loyalty Program with encouraging member engagement and spending trends. Our enrollment has hit nearly 3 million members, which is well ahead of the target we set for fiscal '24. Our members continue to show a higher premium purchase frequency than nonmembers in these early months.We drove engagement during the third quarter via our first-ever members week, along with 8 members-only holiday campaigns, which directly contributed to peak holiday business. We are also working to improve our digital business. Given that our North American e-commerce channel has been tempered during fiscal '24, as we turn to fiscal '25, we are exploring plans to reduce our promotional dependence to create a more premium online presence. Simply put, ua.com will become a showcase for our brand. We have done a lot of work to make our website more functional to increase conversion, but we must create a more premium shopping experience to elevate the brand.Closing out North America, we recently appointed Kara Trent to head up our largest region. Kara has been with Under Armour since 2015 and most recently led our EMEA business to consistent double-digit revenue growth during her tenure. She is an exemplary leader and an industry veteran who builds performances teams, disciplined segmentation, optimized marketing strategies and strong wholesale relationships. As she steps into this role, I am confident that she has the right skill set, demeanor and drive necessary to put this business back on a path of top line growth over the long term. And finally, another leadership appointment is the return of 25-year industry and 9-year Under Armour veteran, Kevin Ross, who will serve as Kara's replacement in EMEA to lead that business as Senior Vice President and Managing Director. With deep experience in general management, sales team sports and product creation, we look forward to Kevin's ability to hit the ground running in one of our most successful markets.In summary, as we close out the fiscal year amid a dynamic market environment, we are incredibly focused on managing the business and making the hard but necessary decisions now to set ourselves up for a more promising future. In the near term, this is involved making several leadership changes engineered to address our areas of opportunity. In concert, we are committed to prudent cost management, including identifying and optimizing the investments in our business towards the highest returns.Over the mid- to long-term, we are confident in our ability to drive global demand creation and elevate design and product while ensuring the trifecta of product, place and promotion, are optimized to put us on a trajectory to reignite growth and deliver improved value to our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Dave for his comments on the quarter and our outlook."", 'David E. Bergman', ""Thanks, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was down 6% to $1.5 billion, which align with our outlook. On a regional basis, North America revenue declined by 12%, coming in at $915 million, which was in line with our expectations. Wholesale was down meaningfully due to challenges in our full-price business, partially offset by growth related to inventory management strategies, which included increased sales to the off-price channel.Our North American DTC business was down slightly during the quarter. EMEA revenue was up 7% to $284 million or up 2% on a currency-neutral basis. This was driven by strong growth in our DTC business related to improved traffic trends across our retail and e-commerce channels. Our EMEA wholesale business was also up during the quarter.APAC revenue was up 7% to $212 million or up 8% on a currency-neutral basis. We saw solid sales growth within our retail stores and wholesale was also up during the quarter. China was a leading contributor to third quarter growth. And finally, our Latin American business was up 9% to $70 million in the quarter or up 3% on a currency-neutral basis.From a channel perspective, wholesale revenue was down 13% to $712 million, with decreases in our full price and distributor businesses, partially offset by higher sales to the off-price channel. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 4% to $741 million due to a 5% increase in our owned and operated store revenue and a 2% increase in our e-commerce business. And licensing revenue decreased 2% in the quarter to $29 million, driven by declines in our Japanese and North American licensee businesses.By product type, apparel revenue was down 6%, driven primarily by declines in our train and outdoor businesses, partially offset by strength in our sideline in basketball categories. Footwear was down 7% due to a tough comparison and softer demand, primarily in North America. As a reminder, we had robust growth during the third quarter of fiscal '23 as a significant volume of footwear products that were previously delayed due to COVID-related factor constraints meaningfully hit the market. And finally, our accessories business was flat year-over-year.Moving down moving the P&L. Gross margin was up 100 basis points to 45.2% during the third quarter driven by approximately 260 basis points of supply chain benefits, mainly due to lower freight costs. These tailwinds were better than our previous expectation and were responsible for most of the overdrive on gross margin. These benefits were partially offset by 140 basis points of unfavorable pricing due to increased promotional activities in our DTC business, our proactive strategy to reduce inventory through our factory houses and deeper discounts in our sales to the off-price channel along with about 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency impacts.In the third quarter, SG&A expenses were flat year-over-year at $602 million. Excluding a $23 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted SG&A expenses were down 4% to $579 million. Next, operating income was $70 million. And excluding our litigation reserve expense, our adjusted operating income was $92 million, which was above our outlook of $65 million to $75 million due to the gross margin overdrive and lower SG&A.After tax, we realized a net income of $114 million or $0.26 of diluted earnings per share. Excluding a $50 million benefit from our final earnout on the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform and a $23 million litigation reserve expense along with the related tax impacts of each, adjusted net income was $84 million or $0.19 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. This came in above our third quarter outlook of $0.09 to $0.11, due to our adjusted operating income overdrive and favorability on the other expense and tax lines.Now moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, our inventory was down 9% to $1.1 billion as we trended towards normalized levels. This was in line with our outlook. And as we end the year, we anticipate our inventory to be down at a mid-teen percentage rate, which should put us close to $1 billion.Rounding out the quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $1 billion, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. And finally, we repurchased $25 million of Class C common stock during the third quarter. This concluded our 2-year $500 million program announced in February of 2022, thus retiring 45.6 million previously outstanding shares.Next, let's turn to our full-year outlook. To start, we have tightened our revenue expectation to a 3% to 4% decline for the full year, which is within our previous range of being down 2% to 4%. The shift within the range represents continued softer wholesale revenue. Breaking this down further, we now expect revenue in North America to be down at a high single-digit rate versus the previous expectation of a 5% to 7% decline. And we now expect our international business to be up at a high single-digit rate versus the previous low double-digit rate increase.From a product perspective, we expect our apparel and footwear businesses to both be down at a low single-digit percentage rate for the full year. Next, we expect gross margin to be up 120 to 130 basis points versus our previous expectation of a 100 to 125 basis point increase. This improvement is related to supply chain benefits and lower-than-expected full-year sales to the off-price channel.Moving down the P&L. Full year SG&A should be flat to down slightly, which is unchanged from our previous expectation. Dropping this through, our reported operating income is expected to reach $287 million to $297 million. Excluding the company's litigation reserve, adjusted operating income is expected to reach $310 million to $320 million. Putting it all together, our reported diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.57 to $0.59, which includes a $0.12 after-tax benefit from our final earn-out on the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform and a $0.05 negative impact from our litigation reserve. Excluding these net positive impacts of $0.07, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.50 and $0.52. So to close, we remain encouraged by our evolving strategies to turn our inconsistencies into strengths. At the same time, we are maintaining a cautious view of the market, and we will continue to work the levers of our P&L to deliver appropriate financial performance while positioning the company for long-term growth. That means managing our supply chain to maximize gross margin opportunities, tightening expenses, optimizing investments, focusing on cash management and making prudent capital expenditures in the near to midterm. Without question, there is much work ahead of us and we look forward to sharing more specific details on our year-end call in May, where we will provide our initial thoughts on fiscal '25.That said, we have confidence in our market sector and that our work will proactively set us up to return to creating value for our shareholders. And with that, we finished our prepared remarks, so I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.

So Stephanie just wondering if you could share a little bit more on your broader color on how you're viewing North America landscape. Maybe how are you guys thinking about when you think about the proactive inventory management. I feel like you're in a good place and maybe versus competition. Just any color there. And then if we can just -- any thoughts on freight and promotions embedded in the full year guidance?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Sure. So I'll start, and then and Dave, I'm sure we'll jump in. And good morning Simeon, thanks for your question. As it relates to North America, as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, the softness in North America is largely being driven by wholesale. And as the year went on, we saw continued softness in that channel, including at-once and replenishment wholesale orders. That's a big piece of the puzzle in North America. And then if you really particularly look at the holiday time frame, there was quite a lot of promotional activity that impacted our performance and others. As it relates to inventory, I'll turn it to Dave in a second, but our inventory continues to trend to be in a much better place. For Under Armour in the industry overall, I'd say, though, that doesn't necessarily mean there'll be no promotional activity that really ties to demand. So there's not always that one-to-one correlation. I think people think could be the case. So I think we're really, really excited about the game plan we have for North America. I'd highlight, again, Kara Trent coming back to lead that business. She has a great track record from her time in EMEA. Terrific leader, terrific relationship with wholesale partners, disciplined segmentation, great targeted marketing efforts that have been driving the brand in that part of the world. And we know she's going to bring those same skills and leadership back when she starts her role in about a week here in North America. So we're excited about the work underway and our efforts around marketing, product and distribution, which I'm sure we'll get into in -- further in the Q&A. But Dave, why don't you weigh in on inventory, that specific question?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. I mean I think you covered the inventory pretty well in that the market, we think, is coming back to normalization at this point, maybe a little bit longer to go, but pretty close. However, we are still seeing a fairly promotional environment out there even with the inventory levels at the retailers in a lot better place. So I think the retailers are being fairly cautious and still really trying to keep clean after a year or two of obviously having more than they wanted. So we do see some of that promotional impact on gross margin continuing a little bit. And so you asked a little bit about freight and promotion relative to our assumptions on the full-year outlook or essentially Q4. And I would say that from a freight perspective, we've seen the rates normalize pretty well at this point, and they had really stopped with the big increase in our fiscal Q4 of last year. So when we think about Q4 of this fiscal year as we finish out the year, we're kind of at a more stabilized freight rate in Q4. So that's not going to be a huge tailwind for us in Q4. However, we are starting to work more deeply with our inventory vendors and have made a lot of progress on some of the costing initiatives there, which we're seeing some of that benefit favorably for Q4 of this year. And then I did mention relative to the promotion levels, we do anticipate it continuing to be more promotional than normal for a while here. And so we're continuing to expect that in our full year forecast as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jay Sole, UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""My question just a little bit on Europe. If you could just maybe touch on that business, how the wholesale channel there is looking if it's different than sort of the comments that you made about the U.S.? And then Stephanie, I'd love to hear a little bit more about the product innovation pipeline, what you see coming over the next couple of quarters and really into the Olympics perhaps. Would love to hear your view on that."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes. Sure, of course. As it relates to EMEA, in Europe, we are -- that is -- continues to be a strong market for us. The brand is doing very well there. That being said, we mentioned this in the remarks, we're seeing a little bit of cooling there with the consumer, particularly in Eastern Europe and some of our distributor markets. But again, the European market, particularly in England and Spain and France, is very strong for us. Let me touch on product, and I'll let Dave jump in on Europe as well. But on the product side, I mean, we have a lot to be excited about. With Yassine just started last week, but we're super excited to have him as our new Chief Product Officer. And of course, as we've shared with you about 5 months ago, John Varvatos joined us as our new Chief Design Officer, and there's just a lot of exciting things happening on both the apparel side and the footwear side. So let me hit a couple of things that we're excited about on the apparel side. We continue to see a lot of traction with our Meridian product for women, where we're really winning with women is in legs -- or sorry, it's bottoms and tops and particularly with bras. We're having a lot of success there. I mentioned that we've got some exciting new things coming with our Unstoppable franchise that's really going to be terrific. And our core base layer really has some new upgrades in terms of fit and colorways and we're excited about that on the apparel side. On the footwear side, we have some real traction with Curry and the Curry 11, excited about what's happening with our running footwear, in particular, with our Velociti Elite and Infinite franchises. As a quick reminder, the Velociti Elite running shoe was worn by last year's New York City's Marathon winner, Sharon Lokedi. She wore again this year and came in third place with only a couple of seconds off the top spot, which is remarkable. So that Velociti running shoe is a real winner at the highest levels of performance and running. And then on the Infinite shoe, we've really reimagined the HOVR technology, which is incredible cushioning. And so we have a base, pro and elite level with that shoe really hitting that segmentation of good, better and best. So we're excited about that. But we're just getting started. Again, Yassine just started last week and we've got an amazing team here that's put -- has some great innovation pipeline, but we're excited to see what Yassine in partnership with the new head of footwear when he fills that position, that search is underway, and of course, with our design talent. So we're excited with what we've got in the product pipeline. I will say it's worth noting that it will take time, though. When we think about the product creation cycle in terms of any real mass of new product, I think we're looking at spring/summer 25-plus just given the product creation cycle that we're dealing with. But Dave, do you want to jump in with any additional color on Europe?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""I mean I think the only thing maybe that I would point out is we have a lot of strength moving forward in Europe, which is great to see. I think one of the points that is a little bit of pressure is just some of the Red Sea shipping disruptions do impact us a little bit there. And that is part of what went into our outlook tightening is that we see about a 1 point headwind from the Red Sea impacts, and that's primarily related to EMEA. And then obviously, there's some geopolitical challenges in that region as well that we're dealing with. So we're working through that. And that's really what I'm mentioning that 1 point headwind that's really talking about fourth quarter and how do we see it finishing out the year."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""I'd add one more thing on the product side, just really quickly, I should have mentioned because it's getting a lot of traction is with our SlipSpeed Mega, which we did a soft launch at the UA All- American game, we did a soft launch there. We have a very cool activation at the Super Bowl this weekend, but the SlipSpeed Mega it's a very cool shoe that I think is really resonating with consumers. So that's another highlight on the footwear front."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu, BNP Paribas.', 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""I was hoping to drill down on North America wholesale. If possible, could you possibly quantify how down North America wholesale was for the quarter or just your expectations for the year, so the audience can better understand the dynamics within this channel. Are you starting to see -- are you starting to have conversations with North American retailers regarding restocking of inventories, particularly for the back half of 2024. And then just, Dave, on that point on the Red Sea, I understand there's some delays, but can you maybe just share with the audience how you -- how much you're contracted out? And when you renegotiate your contracts with the shipping merchants?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. So I guess a couple of things. North America wholesale is definitely a pressure point. We've talked about that. We've talked about kind of the softer orders as we saw coming in through fiscal '20 -- or fall/winter '23 and also a little bit relative to spring/summer '24. We haven't been quantifying the actual percentage for the channel within a region, but definitely is a pressure point, and we're continuing to see an experience where our DTC channels in North America are performing much better than where we are with wholesale. I think again, the retailers are being very cautious right now even though the inventory levels at retail are in a much better place. And that's why we're continuing to see some of the promotional levels as well. When you think about the Red Sea impacts, we are seeing some impacts there from shipping disruptions mainly impacting EMEA. The impact includes some increased shipping costs as well, not just some delays. And to kind of think about that, about 20% or so of our global apparel comes through that area, so it is meaningful to us. We're mitigating that through regional air freight, adjusted shipping lanes, differing forward buys, PO prioritization, et cetera. So -- and with all that, we don't really see any concerns with daily operations of our inventory vendors in that region. But again, we are estimating for Q4 about a 1 point revenue headwind because of the delays and mainly the impact on the EMEA region, and that's considered in our tightening of our outlook for the full year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robert Drbul, Guggenheim.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""Stephanie, just I guess, a bigger picture question for you, but you've made a significant amount of new hires, new leaders since last summer, when I look at the list and think about it Chief Design Officer, Supply Chain Product Officer in Americas. When you think about all these new leaders in the organization, how should we think about the time it will take for the organization to actually absorb the leadership changes, the impacts on the culture, the execution, eventual change and field of the years ahead?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""During my first year, my top priority was building out the right team and to build out the right team to address some of the inconsistencies and challenges that we've had in the past. And you're right, there's been a lot of change. Let me just put a little more color around it. This is -- I've been in the job for about 11 months coming up on my first year. But since last summer, we filled the following jobs. Let me just tick through them quickly. Chief Consumer Officer, Jim Dausch, season Marriott executive, a lot of experience in products, marketing, sales and brand; a new Chief Communication Officer, Amanda Miller, came from PayPal, bringing us real PR horsepower; new Chief Design Officer, John Varvatos, great experience with his own company, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Converse; a new Chief Supply Chain Officer, Shawn Curran, a 30-year veteran at the Gap who was most recently the COO at Old Navy, but held various positions at that company over the years; a new Chief Product Officer Yassine Saidi, who started again last week, as I mentioned, coming from some powerhouse brands and most recently, owning his own company, so he's got that entrepreneurial spirit. A new President of the Americas just starting Kara Trent, industry and UA veteran. We talked about how spectacular she's going to be in her new role. I mentioned that Kevin Ross will backfill Kara and EMEA, a 25-year veteran of the industry knows UA, was with us for 9 years, but experienced at Taylor Made and Yeti in addition to Under Armour. We did also -- I didn't mention this, but in my remarks, we did hire a new SVP of direct-to-consumer for the Americas last summer too Josh Denton, who came -- Under Armour veteran, who came back to us, and we have an open CMO role and a new head of footwear that I covered in my prepared remarks. So when you put all that in the blender, that is a lot of change in roughly 6 months. What's terrific is, again, these executives who all have really incredible backgrounds have hit the ground running. I'm so excited to see how well they're working together. Interestingly, Yassine and Kara work together for close to 9 years at Puma. So to have the Head of North America and the Head of Product already have a deep working relationship between the two of them is terrific. Of course, when you think about executives like Kevin Ross and Josh Denton coming back, they know UA. So this team has hit the ground running, but they do need time to settle in, get their teams organized. I should underscore too, we have amazing talent at Under Armour already that these leaders are joining. Really deep experience, particularly in terms of performance apparel, performance footwear. So we've got a great team in Under Armour. We brought these critical new roles in. Most of when you think about it on a forward-facing part of the business. I put supply chain in there, too, because we can't get things to the right place at the right time they won't be delivered to the customer. It's got quite a lot of work underway on the supply chain front under Shawn's leadership. So it's going to take some time, but to get going, but I'm confident that we have the right team, we have the right strategy and we're firing on all cylinders. So I'm excited with the amount of progress we've made on the talent front in less than a year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sam Poser, Williams Trading.', 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""I've got 3, and I'm just going to read them all out. One, when we think forward, do we anticipate that the SG&A is going to go down? And then you mentioned the Olympics, is that going to be like pump up of investment sort of at the end of Q1 into Q2 of next year? And then two is, what's the base of -- like what's the base sales you look at for North America? Are we close to it? And then on product, it's like use of logo, you've got some good stuff going on with some of the Unstoppable apparel, the Fat Tire, the Forge 96, that really don't scream with the big UA logo and seem to be doing generally better than most out there of the non-Curry product. And I just wondered sort of directionally how you're thinking of logo use and stuff like that and maybe optimize -- exploiting some of those styles that are sort of quieter don't make the list that often, but appear to be -- have pretty good demand."", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes, Sam, this is Dave. I'll take your first 2 questions, and then maybe I'll hand off to Stephanie on the logo. Relative to SG&A and going forward, obviously, this is an area that we continue to focus on. We worked hard over the past few years to become more agile from a cost structure perspective. But we do have more work to do. We understand the areas of highest returns, and we're continuing to validate those and also understand where the best investments need to go. So this is a continual work in process. We continue to drive further savings within our hiring, our incentive comp, tightening up our marketing prioritization, spending, travel and entertainment, et cetera. And we're going to continue that work as we drive into next year. So could we drive SG&A lower? Potentially and that's our focus is to be able to be as optimized as possible, and we're going to keep working with that. Relative to North America, I think your question is, how we hit kind of base sales level for North America? And I would say that's kind of a loaded question because there's a lot of decisions within that. And we know that we want to be -- continue to strive to be more premium. We know that we want to make some right choices as far as backing off some of the deeper discounts, for example, on our on our website. So all of that goes into the blender as we think forward. And as we get to our May call, we'll be getting into much more details on kind of fiscal '25 and beyond. And then as far as you mentioned the Olympics relative to SG&A. And is that going to be a heavy investment? Obviously, we're going to activate some things around the Olympics, but it is not a large investment for us, so it shouldn't be a big pop in SG&A for us in any way. Stephanie, do you want to take the third point on logo."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""On the logo front, I mean, you highlighted some of our best-performing franchises when you mentioned Unstoppable, I'd put Meridian in their base layer. And I think our design teams always do a terrific job of finding the most appropriate and elegant and stylish way to place our logo and so we'll continue. That's in the very able hands of Yassine and John Varvatos as we think about logo treatment. I think there's a broader point I'd like to make, though, around where we're headed with Sportstyle because I think that, that is going to be a really important part of our story in the years to come.And let me define Sportstyle again. We are not trying to be anything other than authentically Under Armour, and performance is in our DNA. It always will be. So for us, Sportstyle is that intersection of performance and style and they're inextricably linked. And I think what you'll see from us and we're thinking about Sportstyle is really more of an evolution versus a revolution. And we started with Phase 1, which is remerchandising and remarketing products to demonstrate kind of that nonactive use occasion. And some of the franchises you mentioned, Unstoppable, Meridian, would be great examples of where we have an opportunity where we have great, particularly on the apparel side, Sportstyle offerings, but we need to market them differently, and we're doing that. And then Phase 2 is really when we'll see more new product. We've already done some limited run capsules and some smaller collections or groupings of items. But again, it's not until spring/summer 25-plus where we think we'll see more mass in terms of new product, given the product creation cycle. But again, throughout all of that, our talented design teams will be figuring out the best way to place the Under Armour logo for maximum return. So again, we're excited. We're excited about where we're headed with product and including the best use of our logo."", 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""Just one last thing. I mean, the one thing about the logo is that like on the forge and some of these other ones, they are more -- they're there, but they're more discrete. So it makes the shoe more flexible rather than having the big Under Armour logo on the side of the shoe, which then makes it more active. Having it more discrete seems to -- would make it more style regardless of what the design of the shoe is or apparel for that matter."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes. Again, I think it depends on what's the particular item and what's its use. And so we'll continue to always be evolving and looking at the best way to -- like, I think, like all world-class brands, the best way to use our logo. But you gave an example with a couple of items where it was more less smaller, but I think we'll continue to evolve and work on that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.', 'James Vincent Duffy', ""Stephanie, prepared remarks and comments are fairly deliberate about your subdued expectations for the North American marketplace, the timing for inflection. Can you give us some perspective on what you're hearing in your discussions with wholesale partners? What are their forward thoughts on consumer spending behavior what's the messaging on subdued orders despite what seems to be pretty well managed channel inventories? What are they asking of Under Armour at this point? And then I have a question on D2C."", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes, I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to Dave to add his perspective. And when we talked about the pressure that we're seeing in North America this year. And as we think about heading into fiscal year '25, I think we can see some anticipated continued bumpiness when I think about the fall/winter '23 order book that, of course, has an impact on the order book coming up. I should note, we're in the middle of it right now. So we're not going to comment on fiscal year '25 in any detail today. But I think it's fair to say for the first part of the year, we'll see some continued bumpiness. Dave can jump in on that. But I think what we're working very, very closely with our wholesale partners to make sure that we have the right assortment and we are continuing to work with our wholesale partners as we deliver more better and best products to make sure that we get those better and best products on their shelves. And so there -- our wholesale partners are incredibly important to us. When I think about our strategy on that side of the house, it really is all about getting more shelf space and better product in our existing partners, but then opening new doors of distribution too on the wholesale side. And that ties to having new product offerings. So that is an important part of our business. I think, again, with -- and particularly in North America with Kara, coming back to lead our charge there. She has tremendous relationships with wholesale partners. I think that's going to just further bolster our success in this area. But I know you had a question on D2C, but let me let Dave jump in on wholesale, if he wants to add any other information..."", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. I mean, I think we've talked, as Stephanie mentioned around kind of the environment and the continued discounting, which is a little bit of a headwind. I would say the other thing is we're kind of finishing out the year moving into next year is, again, we are looking to try and push harder into more premium distribution. We've got some good early reads on mall penetration and new doors there, which is good. And then also, we're going to continue to edit and improve our segmentation as well as we move into next year. But again, it is a little bit bumpy out there still, and it's still a pretty promotional environment."", 'James Vincent Duffy', ""Then just quickly on the D2C. You spoke to your intent to be less promotional in North America D2C that seems to suggest you're planning for declines in fiscal '25, lapping more promotional comparison fiscal '24. Is that a fair assessment?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Yes. So Jim, we're not going to get into details on fiscal '25 yet, but I will say as it relates to our own D2C channels. Let me start with our website and our shop app. We've made a lot of progress on the functional side of that channel, things like improving mobile speed to better search algorithms, upgrading product description pages, et cetera. So there's been a lot of great work done on improving conversion and having a more functional website and shop app. At the same time, and I think this is where you're headed, we do have plans to reduce our dependence on promotions. We need for ua.com and our shop app to be the most premium expression of our company. It's our largest storefront when you think about it. So we are going to reduce our dependency on promotions. Could that have some reduction in revenue? Yes, it could. But at the same time, it will lift ASPs, it will drive profitability and it will lead to a much better, more premium experience for our customers. So that's one piece of the D2C channel. The other part is our stores, our physical stores. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that we have a great effort underway to reimagine the Under Armour brand health of the future, a smaller store format, curated with more premium offerings and easier to shop experience. We're going to be piloting new concept later this year with a goal to roll out more full-price brand houses in the years ahead. We know that our ratio of factory to full price brand houses is not where we want it. So there's a lot of effort underway to think about our physical space as well. And we all know that the -- those two are inextricably linked, meaning the physical and the digital. So we've got a lot of great work underway on the direct-to-consumer front, as it relates to the future."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tom Nikic, Wedbush. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.', 'Kelly Crago', ""This is Kelly on for Paul. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the gross margin. It looks like you're guiding up 200 basis points or so in the fourth quarter and you mentioned some costing initiatives. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that. And if there's any sort of raw material deflation that is benefiting you guys and whether that can continue into F '25? And then on the freight side, while it's no longer going to be a benefit, is there any chance with some of the Red Sea pressures that freight could become a headwind to the gross margin in the next 12 months based on what you're seeing today?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. Kelly, this is Dave. Relative to Q4, there are definitely a few puts and takes that we're seeing there. We do expect some continued supply chain benefits in Q4. And that's -- but that's shifting a little bit more towards the product costing initiatives that we're working on with our vendors that we're going to starting to see those benefits in this Q4 and then looking to see full year benefits next year. The freight component, obviously, we saw pretty substantial tailwinds in Q1, Q2 and Q3 of this year. But again, those have kind of normalized for Q4, so not as much of an increase year-over-year for Q4. Now to your point, relative to the Red Sea, we are seeing some increased shipping costs, but we're probably in the neighborhood of $1 million or $2 million there, not something that is significant at this point. So we're managing through that and that's all considered in our tightened outlook as well. And then a couple of the things that are going to be a little bit of headwinds for Q4, we do believe that the kind of promotional environment is going to continue a little bit longer. So that's assumed in our Q4 as a headwind and potentially a little bit of FX pressure. So those are kind of the main puts and takes as we think about Q4."", 'Kelly Crago', ""Got it. And just lastly for me. Any way to quantify or could you quantify for us the percentage of your off-price sales this year, particularly within North America and how that's trending relative to historical?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. We've worked really hard over the last few years to really get our inventory management into a good spot and manage the off-price channel in what we feel is a pretty healthy range. And so we were targeting in the 3% to 4% of global mix of third-party liquidations and that's generally where we're running. In fact, as we finish out this year -- this fiscal year, we'll probably be at the lower end of that, 3% to 4% total mix. Relative to North America, it's not that different, but we don't really get into the mix per region per se."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.', 'Lance Allega', ""This will be our last question -- so Alex, I'm just going to let everybody know this going to be the last question, so I appreciate it. But go ahead, Alex."", 'Alexandra Ann Straton', ""So Stephanie, you noted a lot of leadership changes. I just want to drill down on kind of how you think about when they can start to have an impact on the P&L from a time line perspective? And then also, in the meantime, as understanding that can't be done immediately. What are the KPIs in your view that you're watching that we should be watching for signs of some of these initiatives flowing through?"", 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Sure, of course. Well, these leaders have hit the ground running. So I think they're impacting the business right away. I don't want to tick through each one of them again, but for example, I use John Varvatos is just as an example. He's been here 5 months. On day 1, he started looking at things like fit, finish, trim, color. So we're seeing the leaders have an impact on day 1, but it will take time in terms of bigger, broader impact across the business. In terms of the KPIs that we're going to be looking at I mean it depends on the area, but let me hit on some that we're really focused on. In terms of the the consumer and margin KPIs, we are constantly keeping an eye on our loyalty, our UA rewards sign-ups equally important activations. I mean, the loyalty program will be the backbone of our consumer strategy. It's all about customer acquisition and all about customer activation. And I mentioned some of the good progress we're having there in terms of not only sign-ups, but increased spend from our loyalty members. And then on the marketing front, there's all sorts of leading and lagging indicators that we'll be looking at, and I'm sure over the course of our time with you sharing updates on things like search demand. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of the progress we're having with social media. We've really changed our marketing approach to be more product focused, more digital, social, always on, that's where the consumer is. And so we're always looking at the metrics on that critical marketing channel, NPS scores, increased earned media, then we'll be looking at more lagging indicators as we move forward, increased full price sales, faster sell-through of our key franchises. As we open more doors, further doors of distribution, getting into more specialty retail, seeing things like more UA sold on the aftermarket. So there's a lot of consumer metrics both leading and lagging KPIs that we'll be looking at. Then we have made a lot of good progress over the past couple of years on supply chain, but this is where we still have more work to do. So we're focused on -- Dave touched on this, our cost of goods sold, SKU rationalization, better segmentation that will lead to ASP expansion. We'll be sharing more with you on our priority investments and the results there. So there's a whole host of KPIs and metrics across the business that we will be focused on and tracking and sharing with you is early indicators of how we're making progress along the way. Although -- I'll end where I started with, which is my excitement about the team we've built here, we have brought in some set fantastic executives to join our already fantastic team at Under Armour. So I couldn't be more excited and more thrilled with the team we're building here and our future. We've got a lot of great stuff underway. So thanks for your question."", 'David E. Bergman', 'Our teams on the field.', 'Stephanie Coleman Linnartz', ""Our teams on the field. That's right."", 'Operator', ""Thank you for attending today's call for Under Armour third quarter of fiscal 2024. This now concludes today's call. Have a great day.""]"

The fashion-conscious change comes as the historically performance-focused brand leans more heavily into lifestyle footwear designs.', 'More from Footwear News', 'Zegna Group to Build New Footwear, Leather Goods Production\xa0Facility', ""Inside Under Armour's Plan To Make The Next Viral Sneaker"", 'For example, Under Armour’s Forge 96 lifestyle sneaker features a mesh and nubuck leather upper with a small, subtle UA logo on the heel tab. The brand’s UA Summit Trek shoes also feature a small, almost hard to find UA logo on the side of the shoe.', 'In a note to investors last week, Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser called out the Forge 96 as an example of improved product from Under Armour, highlighting the shoe’s “subtle logo treatment.” During Under Armour’s Thursday call with analysts, Poser asked Linnartz about the company’s philosophy regarding logo use, especially on products like the Forge that he said “don’t scream with the big UA logo and seem to be doing generally better than most of the non-Curry product.”', '“On the Forge and some other ones, [the logos are] there, but they’re more discrete,” Poser told Linnartz on Thursday’s call. “It makes the shoe more flexible rather than having the big Under Armour logo on the side of the shoe, which then makes it more active. Having it more discrete seems to make it more stylish regardless of what the design of the shoe is or apparel for that matter.”', 'Linnartz said that strategies around the logo depend on the type of shoe, but style is always a factor. “Our design teams always do a terrific job of finding the most appropriate, elegant and stylish way to place our logo,” she said.', 'While brands like Nike might be able to cultivate demand and loyalty for their shoes by featuring their iconic Swoosh prominently, Under Armour’s logo is less ubiquitous. And its $1.5 billion shoe business, which represented just a quarter of its total revenues in 2023, is smaller than Nike’s massive shoe business, which makes up more than half its total sales.', 'For Under Armour, part of growing footwear will hinge on wins in the lifestyle category. In pursuit of this broader goal, the company recently tapped rock ’n’ roll-inspired menswear designer John Varvatos as chief design officer and Puma’s former head of sportstyle footwear Yassine Saidi as chief product officer.', '“We’ll continue to always be evolving and looking at the best way to — like all world-class brands — use our logo,” Linnartz said. She also noted that most of the new product to emerge in the lifestyle shoe category will start to come into market in Spring/Summer of 2025.', '“Throughout all of that, our talented design teams will be figuring out the best way to place the Under Armour logo for maximum return,” she said. “We’re excited about where we’re headed with product, including the best use of our logo.”', 'Best of Footwear News', ""The Greatest Super Bowl Shoe Commercials of All Time: From Nike's 1993 'Hare Jordan' to Skechers' Snoop Dogg Ad"", 'Skechers Super Bowl Ads Through the Years: Kim Kardashian, Willie Nelson, Snoop Dogg and More', ""Nike's Tiger Woods Building: Everything to Know About the Two-Story Conference Center Built in 2001""]"

They are climbing after better than expected earnings and a strong outlook overshadowing its steady decline in revenue. Weak sales across the US and a slowdown in its wholesale business among the biggest challenges for the retailer. We've got David Swartz who is the Morningstar Equity analyst here with us."", ""David, great to see you. Just take us into what does that play more long term for this outlook from Under Armor and where they're sitting right now within this mix of athletic apparel and footwear companies?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: Right now Under Armor is struggling for the most part. The company has no sales growth. Its sales were down more in the quarter from last year than I expected. And really if you listen to the conference call, the company didn't really explain that anything's going to change in the near term. It's really going to take several quarters before we see a lot of new product and a lot of new strategies that are really going to drive any top-line growth."", ""Now, this is not entirely Under Armor's fault, of course, because right now the sportswear market is pretty challenged. In just the last few weeks, we've heard pretty dim outlooks from Puma, Adidas, and Nike. So right now it's kind of a tough market. And so Under Armor is trying to really drive growth in a period that's pretty tough for the industry."", 'SEANA SMITH: So David where does that leave Under Armor then from here? Because when you take a look at those inventory levels, yes, there was some improvement in the most recent quarter but still not to the degree as maybe we were hoping to see. Some of that improvement-- obviously, going back to your previous point, Under Armor not alone in this. But in terms of what that inventory level looks like over the coming quarters, do you expect more material improvement there?', ""DAVID SWARTZ: I think we will see improvement, but the problem is that wholesale orders right now are very low. The wholesale orders, especially in the US are way below normal. And so it's very difficult to actually manage your inventory when stuff is not selling through, and it's not being sold to your retail customers."", ""One of Under Armor's biggest problems is that it's too dependent on the wholesale market. It's dependent on department stores like Kohl's. It's dependent on also sporting goods stores too. And a lot of it depends on how healthy they are. And right now, their orders and sales are not that strong, and so that's affecting Under Armor's ability to manage its inventory."", ""BRAD SMITH: You know, David, we've been tracking some of the announcements from athletic footwear specific companies and the innovation that some of them are trying to put forward this year and take to market, whether that's new entrants like Lululemon finally getting into men's footwear, and then you've got Nike with Airmax DNn, which that comes ahead of Air Max Day. You've also got the chunky soles at HOKA on running. We could go down the list. What is innovation from Under Armor look like this year, and is that something that investors can hang their hat on?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: I don't see a lot of innovation from Under Armor right now. And to be honest, it doesn't look like the company is really planning that much this year. A lot of the real product development cycle is really geared towards 2025 it seems like at Under Armor. We've been warned about this. The company is going into more casual sports rather than its traditional performance sportswear."", ""But it has explained to us that it's going to take some time for that to happen. The company has a designer. John Varvatos used to be a pretty well-known fashion designer on his own who's now the lead designer for Under Armor."", ""But we've been told that it's going to take some time for his products to actually reach the market given the long lead times in this industry, which can be as easily 18 months from the time that a product is designed to the time that it actually reaches consumers. So I don't think we're going to see a lot of innovation really in the short term for Under Armor, and I think that's part of the reason why the stock is depressed."", ""SEANA SMITH: David, do you think it's time for a brand reevaluation? I bring this up just because we're in the midst of a turnaround. You're saying it's going to take longer than maybe initially anticipated here to play out. Should Under Armor be further adjusting its business given the shift that we're seeing in consumer spending?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: Under Armor really has been in a turnaround situation for about seven or eight years now. So there have been a lot of changes, and I think some of them have been positive. I don't think it's the situation where the company needs to panic in any way. Under Armor does have a strong cash flow this year. Its inventories are much better. Its balance sheet is very good. The company has minimal debt."", ""So Under Armor really is not under any great pressure to turn things around right now. The stock price is clearly low. You're in the single digits, and that's a concern. But the company itself is not in any risk of distress. It's really just a matter of trying to generate top line growth again which has been Under Armor's problem for years.""]"

Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.', 'On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits.

Over the past year, PRU's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.93 and as low as 6.27, with a median of 7.36."", ""Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PRU's P/B ratio of 1.39. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PRU's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.63. Over the past 12 months, PRU's P/B has been as high as 2.26 and as low as 0.88, with a median of 1.22."", ""Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PRU has a P/S ratio of 0.77.

Now, I'll turn it over to Charlie."", ""Charles Lowrey: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to comment on our CFO transition. As you saw from yesterday's news release, Yanela Frias, President of Prudential's Group Insurance Business has been named Executive Vice President and CFO of Prudential, succeeding Ken Tanji, has a 27-year veteran of Prudential. Yanela is a seasoned executive who brings a deep understanding of our business and industry, as well as significant finance, operations and leadership experience. I'm sure you'll enjoy getting to know her as she starts her new role. Yanela will become CFO effective March 15, and Ken will stay on for a six-month period to ensure a smooth transition. Ken has been a great partner and friend and has had a distinguished 35-year career at Prudential."", ""I don't need to go back far to articulate his impact. Most recently, as CFO, Ken guided Prudential through the financial challenges of the COVID pandemic and the market volatility that followed. During the same time, his leadership on strategic initiatives meaningfully contributed to our goals of becoming less market-sensitive and more nimble. We are grateful to Ken for his many contributions over more than three decades and wish him well. Now, let's turn to my remarks for the quarter. Our financial results for 2023 reflect continued strong sales momentum across our insurance and retirement businesses and solid underlying earnings growth. The fourth quarter capped a productive year of continued transformation to make Prudential a higher growth, more capital-efficient and more nimble company."", 'Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment and deliver long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 3. I will begin today by sharing a few examples of how we are transforming our business to drive future growth and unlock value for all our stakeholders. Over the course of 2023, we executed several attractive transactions adding to our capital efficiency. We reinsure the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities, reducing our market sensitivity. We closed a $10 billion transaction of structured settlement annuities with Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company we launched. Prismic will enhance our mutually reinforcing business system and drive future growth by leveraging our differentiated brands, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution.', ""In addition, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Somerset Re for a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life reserves, which will release capital and increase earnings. We continue to strengthen the capabilities of our market-leading businesses through strategic M&A, expanded distribution channels and created new products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers across the globe and to support future growth. In PGIM, we enhanced our capabilities in the attractive area of private credit and direct lending by acquiring a majority stake in Dearpath Capital, which closed in December. To further provide investors with a cohesive offering, we brought together PGIM's private alternatives capabilities into one global team with the formation of PGIM private alternatives."", 'Internationally, we continue to expand third-party distribution in Latin America through Mercado Libre, reaching a milestone of close to 300,000 policies in force last quarter. In Japan, we launched expanded inheritance and new investment products to diversify our portfolio and meet a broader range of customer needs. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business secured its second largest longevity risk transfer transaction ever with one of the biggest life insurance companies in the Netherlands. This marks our first international reinsurance deal in the Dutch market. Retirement strategies also worked with Fidelity Investments to address growing consumer demand for a workplace retirement income solution. Our Prudential Simply Income product, a new single premium immediate annuity is now available to employer-based retirement plans administered by Fidelity.', 'In addition, to solidify our leadership and expand our addressable market and structured settlements, we launched a new index structured settlement annuity product. We also continue to create a more nimble and efficient company to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace. This included evolving our operating model and organizational structure to better support customers at the business level and leveraging technology to bring products to market faster. Our business and technology teams together launched an average of one new or enhanced product every two weeks in 2023. Additionally, we are strategically leaning into partnerships with cutting-edge technology firms within our group business to increase the speed of innovation, add capabilities and enhance customer experience.', ""We entered 2024 with momentum and optimism as we have expanded and diversified our product offerings, enhanced customer and client experiences and continued to reinvest in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth. Moving to Slide 4. Our transformation strategy and growth initiatives are supported by Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework, which have allowed us to confidently navigate the macroeconomic environment. Our AA rated financial strength, includes a strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.1 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management."", 'Turning to Slide 5, our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders. For 2024, our board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. And now I will turn it over to Rob.', ""Robert Falzon: Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $5.5 billion or $11.62 per share for 2023 and $1.3 billion or $2.58 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect an increase in the underlying earnings power of our businesses, including the benefits of strong sales growth and higher interest rates. This was partially offset by pressure on variable investment income and higher expenses, primarily due to a $200 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $374 million higher than our after-tax AOI primarily driven by net investment gains due to declining rates."", 'Turning to the quarterly operating results of our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower incentive fees and agency income and higher expenses. This was partially offset by higher asset management fees, including the benefits from our acquisition of Deerpath Capital and of launching Prismic. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and lower expenses. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we pivot to less market-sensitive products. The earnings in our international businesses primarily reflected less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior partially offset by lower expenses.', ""Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance over the past year has also driven attractive long-term performance with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five- and 10-year periods. PGIM's assets under management increased 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year ago quarter, primarily resulting from market appreciation. Third-party net outflows in the fourth quarter totaled $13.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $6.3 billion were driven primarily by a large redemption of a low fee equity index mandate and redemptions in public fixed income resulting from client rebalancing and liquidity needs."", ""Retail outflows of $7.2 billion were primarily driven by equity, sub-advised mandates and fixed income outflows. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer Prismic or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities."", ""In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our PGIM Private Alternatives business, which has assets of approximately $240 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $9 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8, our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive growth by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential."", 'Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by strong international reinsurance sales and our best quarter for structured settlements since 2016. International Reinsurance sales included a $9.2 billion transaction in the Netherlands and with the recently passed Dutch Pension Reform Legislation, we anticipate this market will continue to grow over time. Individual Retirement posted $2.1 billion in sales, reaching the highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, which increased about 20% from the year ago quarter, while fixed annuity sales have doubled.', ""Our Individual Life sales increased 33% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our product pivot strategy towards more capital-efficient products. Variable life protection and accumulation products represented approximately 70% of sales for the year, including a benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product. In group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our full year sales were up 11% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. Group's full year adjusted operating income was the highest in the past 15 years and included favorable underwriting experience."", 'As a result, we are lowering our benefits ratio target range by 2 percentage points to 83% to 87%. Turning to Slide 9, our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value.', 'Sales in our international businesses were up 24% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 21%, including the benefits of recent product launches in Japan to diversify our product offering. In addition, Brazil sales were up 24%, reflecting growth across all channels and leading to a full year record. Gibraltar sales were up 27%, primarily driven by higher independent agency sales and growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers.', ""And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken."", ""Kenneth Tanji: Thanks Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2024 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.58 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items; first, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $95 million. Second, underwriting experience was below expectations by $15 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect $30 million of unfavorable seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we included an adjustment of $240 million for expenses and other items."", ""This includes the $200 million restructuring charge related to changes in our organizational structure as well as adjustments for typical seasonality related to the timing of expenses and premium. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.36 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased significantly over the past year, while we have also made strategic progress improving our risk profile. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2024 in the appendix."", ""Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we expect PICA's year-end RBC ratio to be greater than 425%. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.1 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to confidently navigate the macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment."", ""Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."", 'See also 15 Highest Quality Makeup Brands In The World and 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Oil giants ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum have sealed deals to buy rivals. Meanwhile, several smaller producers have also made acquisitions. "", ""Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) could be the next oil stock to make an acquisition. It has reportedly offered to buy Enerplus (NYSE: ERF). Here's a look at why Devon is interested in the company. "", ""Enerplus is a Canadian headquartered, U.S.-focused oil and gas company. It was Canada's first oil and gas royalty trust when it started operations in 1986. However, the company has evolved over the years. It sold its remaining Canadian assets at the end of 2022 to focus on its higher-return U.S. resource plays. "", 'Today, Enerplus operates in the oil-rich Bakken region of North Dakota and the gas-rich Marcellus of Pennsylvania. Roughly 73% of its production comes from the Bakken, 26% from the Marcellus, and 1% from other regions (DJ Basin). Meanwhile, oil makes up the majority of its production (51%), while natural gas is 38% and natural gas liquids is 11%. The company produces about 98,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). ', 'Enerplus also produces a lot of cash. It expected to produce $960 million of adjusted free cash flow last year and $430 million in free cash after funding its capital-spending program. Like Devon, Enerplus returns the bulk of its free cash flow to investors (it targeted to return 70% last year via dividends and share repurchases). Meanwhile, the company has a strong balance sheet with a low 0.2 times leverage ratio. ', ""Enerplus would check a lot of boxes for Devon Energy. In particular, it would significantly increase the company's scale in the Bakken. Enerplus currently has 236,000 net acres in the region, where it produces 77,702 BOE/d. Meanwhile, the company has 655 remaining net-drilling locations. That gives it a lot of inventory, given its current drilling brings about 50 wells online each year. "", ""Devon's Bakken position is a lot smaller. It produces about 54,000 BOE/d, which is less than 10% of its total output (665,000 BOE/d during the third quarter). While the Bakken is a smaller region for Devon, it has been working to increase its scale through acquisition. It enhanced its position in the region by acquiring the leasehold interest and related assets of RimRock Oil and Gas for $865 million in 2022. Buying Enerplus would enable Devon to further enhance its scale in the region. That would help it to capture cost savings and improve its free cash flow from the combined assets. "", ""Acquiring Enerplus would also add some land in the DJ Basin to complement Devon's operations in the Powder River Basin area. Enerplus spent about 2% of its 2023 capital budget to drill three wells in that region last year. "", ""Enerplus also has a non-operated position in the Marcellus. It currently doesn't invest much capital in that position due to lower gas prices. Because of that, its output has started to decline. Since Devon doesn't operate in the Marcellus (and has sold its gassier acreage in recent years), it probably would look to sell this non-core position should it acquire Enerplus. "", ""Devon has reportedly looked into several acquisition opportunities and has apparently settled on Enerplus. While buying Enerplus would check a lot of boxes for the company by enhancing its scale in the Bakken and increasing its free cash flow, it's not a perfect fit. However, an acquisition of Enerplus could create value for shareholders at the right price, making this an interesting development to watch."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Devon Energy wasn’t one of them.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs."", 'David Gibbs: Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our results, I want to express our continued concern for those impacted by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our franchisees and employees in the region. Turning to 2023, it was a remarkable year for Yum! Brands as we crossed the $60 billion system sales threshold and exceeded all aspects of our long-term growth algorithm. Despite facing numerous challenges around the world, our incredible teams delivered another exceptional year of growth across our business. We set an industry development record for the third straight year. We made massive strides in scaling our proprietary digital and AI-driven ecosystem, and we continued to build a talent base that I believe is the best in the industry.', ""We delivered 6% unit growth, 10% system sales growth, and 12% core operating profit growth. We entered 2024 having opened just shy of 10, 000 net new restaurants over the past three years and are well on our way to reaching 60, 000 restaurants this year. This growth would not be possible were not for our world-class franchise partners who continue to deploy their own capital based on their confidence to invest behind the long-term potential of our brand. Along with the record-breaking success we've had on development, our digital strategy has helped propel top-line results and improve bottom line profits. Digital sales approached $30 billion in 2023, up 22% year-over-year, with mix now exceeding 45%. At the same time, we have accelerated the deployment of our proprietary technologies to optimize back-of-house operations and make it easier to run our restaurants."", ""In doing so, we are equipping our franchise partners with distinctive capabilities that differentiate them from the competition, especially in emerging markets. I'll now share some more details on the fourth quarter specifically. During the quarter, top line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. This represented a low single digit headwind to Yum!’s overall fourth quarter same-store sales growth. This trend has continued into the first quarter and we expect the sales impact to decrease over the course of 2024. Key to our growth is the performance of our twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which account for approximately 70% of Yum! system sales and roughly 80% of Yum!’s division operating profit."", ""In 2023, KFC International opened nearly 2,700 new restaurants reaching 10% growth with restaurants opened across 96 countries. More than 80% of unit growth came from our 15 publicly traded franchisees. Entering 2024, I have strong confidence in the durability of KFC's global expansion, for which we continue to see an incremental 50, 000 restaurant opportunity over the long term. On a global basis, Taco Bell crossed the $15 billion system sales milestone this year, reflecting the growing scale of this powerhouse brand. Turning to Taco Bell U.S., which contributes more than 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit, the brand maintained its two year same-store sales trend in the fourth quarter, outperforming the QSR industry. Taco Bell continued to deliver industry-leading margins at 24% this year, while at the same time leading the QSR industry in several key value perception indicators."", ""Now, I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or RED for short, followed by our unrivaled culture and talent and good growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our fourth quarter results and balance sheet position, followed by our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for 50% of our divisional operating profit and will soon cross the incredible milestone of 30,000 units. For the year, system sales grew 12% with 8% unit growth and 7% same-store sales growth. For the quarter, KFC achieved 7% system sales growth, owing to 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East."", ""KFC China grew system sales by an impressive 20% during the quarter. We had several other standouts markets this quarter, including 16% system sales growth in Latin America and 13% system sales growth in both Africa and Thailand. In Latin America, we targeted new consumers and day parts using compelling value offers, and we expanded our KFC original nuggets. In Africa, the team boosted its breakfast day part with new beverages, including signature coffees at a great price. The Thailand market saw strong transaction growth driven by smart value offerings across all day parts. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were flat this quarter, with trends on a two year basis remaining consistent from the prior quarter. In Q1, the team has planned a range of exciting initiatives, including the Smash'd Potato Bowls, the first bowl innovation since 2019, and the rollout of KFC's first loyalty rewards program."", ""Moving on to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 36% of our divisional operating profit. At Taco Bell U.S., fourth quarter same-store sales grew 3% and 15% on a two year basis, outperforming the QSR industry by three points. Taco Bell U.S. faced tough laps early in the quarter, but finished the year strong with comps up over 5% in the final period. The quarter included a record digital sales mix, which reached 31%, up 7 points year-over-year. Growth in kiosk sales was a large driver, with in-store kiosk sales mix increasing 15 points from Q4 last year. Optimizing our digital channels is also contributing to growth in Taco Bell's loyalty program, with active loyalty users growing 17% in 2023. The team plans to bring exciting enhancements to the loyalty program in the second half of 2024 to capitalize on digital engagement and provide an easier experience for customers to earn and redeem points."", ""While not surprising, I'm always proud to see our incredible Taco Bell team's efforts being recognized, with Entrepreneur Magazine naming the brand the number one franchisor for the fourth year running, and with Nation’s Restaurant News crowning Taco Bell the 2023 brand icon. With an unprecedented range of exciting innovations launching this year, including at least one new product every five weeks, twice the rate of 2023, I'm confident Taco Bell will remain a brand icon for years to come. At Taco Bell International, we delivered 14% unit growth this year. The majority of this growth was contributed by our big four scaled markets including Spain which opened 19 new units this year and is on track to reach 150 units in Q1. As we enter 2024, we will work with our franchise partners in these markets to build brand and category awareness with Mexican food, particularly in Europe and Asia, leaning into fan favorites and expanding protein offerings."", 'Additionally, we are working on scaling and entering new markets that will enable a broader base from which to grow. Next at the Pizza Hut Division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit and will soon eclipse 20, 000 units. In Q4, system sales grew 1% with 4% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. For the full year, system sales grew 5%, including 4% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International, same-store sales were flat for the quarter. The team continues to roll out Melts across the globe to build the individual eater occasion. Strength in the aggregator channel continues to be a bright spot across several markets, including Canada and Latin America.', 'Buy-one-get-one deals coupled with aggregator promotions drove transaction growth in Canada during the quarter. In Latin America, the promotion of our own digital channels in Brazil combined with the New York style pizza helped boost sales for that market. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 4% for the quarter while growing 1% for the full year. The Melts launch and the promotion of the Detroit-Style Pizza in the prior year contributed to a difficult lap this quarter. Pizza Hut U.S. will face another challenging lap in Q1 as same-store sales increased 8% last year, reflecting a full quarter of sales from the Melts platform and the Big New Yorker. However, we expect performance trends on a two year basis to improve in the first quarter.', ""In Q1, the team will launch two limited time offers, including Hot Honey Pizza and Wings, a perfect pairing for fans to enjoy in the run-up to the Super Bowl. In the months ahead, the team will be announcing some exciting innovations to the melts platform. Lastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, for the full year, system sales grew 6%, led by 8% unit growth. Reflecting on 2023, Habit's new leadership team focused on improving all elements of Habit's operations, including expediting a robust kiosk rollout, implementing a sales-driven labor optimization model, and harnessing Yum!’s Co-op purchasing group to lower procurement costs and rationalize SKUs. As a result of these efforts, the team achieved a 380 basis point increase in full year store level margins despite softness in sales."", ""Now I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. We take great pride in developing our talent and ensuring we have a strong bench to drive performance and we were thrilled to be recognized in Time Magazine's inaugural list of the Best Companies for Future Leaders, with Yum! ranking an impressive 32nd among U.S. companies. The strength of our talent is evident through Sean Tresvant's official transition to Taco Bell Division CEO on January 1st. Sean joined Yum! in 2022 and is a visionary business leader with a proven track record of driving transformative brand building through his previous role as the Taco Bell Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. I'd like to again congratulate Sean as he takes the helm at Taco Bell and I'm confident he and the rest of the team will continue to successfully deliver the brand's long-term global growth strategy."", ""I'd also be remiss if we didn't take another opportunity to recognize Mark King for everything he did as Taco Bell Division CEO to set the brand up for future success, including hand picking Sean as his successor and ensuring that Taco Bell would be in more than capable hands. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, I want to thank Mark for his people first leadership that drove strong results, inspired restless creativity and solidified Taco Bell's unique brand identity that makes it an undisputed global icon. Additionally, Pizza Global Chief Technology officer Joe Park will be moving into the Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer role currently held by Clay Johnson, who will continue as a Senior Advisor. I want to thank Clay for his incredible leadership since joining Yum! in 2019, including developing our digital and technology capabilities from the ground up and establishing Yum! as a clear leader in technology in global QSR."", ""Since joining Yum! Joe formed our first ever long-range innovation team before moving on to Pizza Hut, our most digital brand, where he partnered with our global operations and technology leaders to deliver new levels of ease to our customers and improved unit economics for our franchisees. I'm confident he is the perfect person to lead us into the next chapter on our digital and technology journey. Moving on to the Planet pillar of our good growth strategy, in 2023 we remain focused on efforts under our priority areas of greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable packaging. We've made progress on our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 through investments in renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and through ongoing commitments with our food suppliers."", ""In terms of packaging, we are increasing our global use of more widely recyclable plastics in our consumer packaging and we continue to remove plastic packaging in the form of bags and cutlery in addition to eliminating styrofoam. Our continued progress in sustainability has been underscored by several recent recognitions, including being named to the 2024 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the eighth consecutive year and being listed by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2024. Before I wrap, I want to pay tribute to our incredible partners at Yum! China. In December, my team and I traveled to Shanghai to meet with CEO Joey Wat and her executive team. That trip reinforced our view that Yum! China is without question the world's most capable restaurant operator."", 'They enable rapid growth and structural cost efficiencies through their dynamic development capabilities and their robust in-house supply chain. Our team sampled amazing new menu items in their innovation kitchen, and we saw firsthand the digital capabilities that enable Yum! China to engage with an astounding 470 million members in its loyalty program. These advantages enable consistent paybacks of two to three years in KFC and Pizza Hut despite evolving market conditions, further testament to their clear competitive advantages in the market. As I look back over the last year, the unique advantages of our diversified system shone through, while the business faced persistent inflation across the globe and navigated shifts in consumer sentiment stemming from regional conflicts.', ""We responded with a focused determination to execute our growth plan, including growing units in 110 countries, meaningfully scaling our technology systems, deepening collaboration across our brands, and delivering both sales and profits well above our long-term growth algorithms. We're confident 2024 will be another banner year with a number of exciting sales driving opportunities, such as enhancing the range of protein offerings at Taco Bell, expanding new category entry points, and significantly boosting the impact of our loyalty program. With a world class team, globally iconic brands, industry leading franchisees, and a relentless appetite for growth, the future is brighter than ever and I am confident that we will continue to maximize value for our shareholders."", 'With that, Chris, over to you.', ""Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2023 was an exceptional year with Yum! exceeding all components of our long-term growth algorithm. Full year, same-store sales grew a very robust 6%. We opened 4, 754 gross new units, the equivalent of 13 restaurants a day, or one restaurant roughly every two hours. KFC set a brand development record, opening over 2, 700 new units across 97 different countries. I also want to extend congratulations to the Yum! China team, who crossed 10, 000 KFC restaurants this quarter with nearly 40% of those restaurants built in the last three years."", ""Turning to our results, full year system sales grew 10%, with fourth quarter system sales up 5%, led by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Yum!'s twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., grew system sales 12% this year. Fourth quarter, ex-special, general and administrative expenses were $344 million, down 4% year-over-year due to strict cost control. Reported G&A was $353 million for the quarter, including $9 million in special expense related to an ongoing resource optimization project. For the full year, ex-special, general and administrative expenses were $1.17 billion. Core profit grew 8% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Reported operating profit included a negligible impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation and a $49 million headwind for the full year."", 'Our ex-special tax rate was 26% in the quarter and slightly under 21% for the full year. Fourth quarter, ex-special EPS was $1.26, a decline year-over-year stemming from a $0.23 headwind from fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate that drove our effective tax rate above our guided range in 2023 and below our guided range in 2022. Full year, ex-special EPS was $5.17, a 14% increase year-over-year. Now, let me share some greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our bold restaurant development growth driver. Yum! opened just shy of 1, 900 units in the fourth quarter, with approximately 87% of that growth coming from our international markets. The KFC Division was the largest driver, finishing the year with units up 8%.', ""China, India, Thailand, South Africa, and Spain drove KFC's development this year and were part of a group of 15 countries that grew unit count by more than 25 restaurants. In December, we were pleased to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC restaurants from our largest franchisee in the UK. This is an exciting opportunity for us to purchase restaurants with average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins in a market where we have an exceptional local management team who run our existing KFC UK equity store base. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition, while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchise rights, which will be reflected in store level margins post-acquisition."", ""We anticipate this transaction to close during the second quarter. At Pizza Hut, the division opened 575 units for the quarter and nearly 1, 600 units for the year, a record for the brand. There were 73 markets that contributed to the brand's development. China, India, Turkey, Japan, and Canada led Pizza Hut's growth internationally with more than 900 units opened across those countries. The Taco Bell division opened 201 units in Q4 and 417 units for the full year. In the U.S., unit development was also on fire with 244 gross new units. Our longer-term growth engines that include Habit and Taco Bell International opened 208 units on a combined basis and grew unit count by 12%. We finished 2023 with unit growth occurring in 110 countries. We now have units in 293 brand country combinations, providing an unmatched level of diversity geographically, as well as in consumer preference with leading brands in the chicken, pizza, and Mexican categories."", ""Looking ahead, we expect development in 2024 to continue at a robust pace. In the first half, KFC will reach an incredible 30, 000 units and Pizza Hut will top 20, 000 units. At KFC, we enter 2024 with more development commitments than last year. We recently returned from an inspiring visit to China in December and were reminded of the incredible runway for KFC's growth in the market, where Yum! China has over 10, 000 KFC restaurants, yet serves only one-third of the population. Taco Bell International will continue to expand their footprint, though the growth rate will temporarily slow as the brand looks to stabilize same-store sales performance in emerging markets and partner with franchisees to optimize site selection, leveraging KFC and Pizza Hut market mapping data."", ""Moving on to our unmatched operating capabilities growth driver, which I'll speak to through the lens of our digital strategy involving our easy experiences, easy operations, and easy insights pillars. 2023 was a landmark year for successfully scaling our suite of proprietary technologies across our global restaurant base. Beginning with our easy experiences pillar, we have successfully deployed our Yum! Commerce platform to KFC U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. and are continuing to onboard the Pizza Hut U.S. system. Looking ahead, we will start to deploy this platform to two Pizza Hut International markets in the first half of 2024. Kiosks remain an important priority in delivering a consistent customer experience, driving ticket uplift, and streamlining our restaurant operations."", ""Globally, we've increased our kiosk penetration in KFC restaurants by 70% over the past year outside of China. We ended the year with kiosks in approximately 500 KFC U.S. restaurants, a huge step up from nearly zero only two quarters before. Our KFC Latin America markets also began the rollout of kiosks using our proprietary TicTuk platform this year and planned to triple the restaurant count in 2024. Within easy operations, this quarter, we continued to fire on all cylinders, significantly expanding the rollout of our world-class technology products and platforms. Poseidon, our proprietary point of sale system, which was expanded to an additional 1, 700 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, resulting in 5, 000 restaurants having been onboarded this year."", 'We also ramped up the deployment of our Dragontail AI platform with an additional 1, 000 locations onboarded this quarter and over 4, 000 new restaurants added for the full year. We now have Dragontail in place in nearly 7, 000 restaurants across Pizza Hut and KFC. Our 2024 rollout will include launching Dragontail in nearly 6, 000 more restaurants. Further evidence of our ability to scale software globally at a rapid pace. Our AI-driven automated inventory management system is now being used in 90% of our KFC U.S. locations and roughly half of our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, driving more seamless and more accurate inventory ordering processes for our restaurant managers. More than 3, 000 additional restaurants across KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut will be onboarded to the automated inventory management system in 2024.', 'Finally, our custom-built SuperApp, which provides smart, automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in over 8, 500 Pizza Hut restaurants globally, and KFC has plans to roll this out to approximately 6, 000 restaurants in 2024. For the third pillar of our easy strategy, Easy Insights, we are fully leveraging our unique global scale to bring new insights and enable even smarter and quicker decision making. This year, we expanded the reach of our Yum! GlobalData Hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics. In 2024, our Easy Insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the GlobalData Hub and integrate into our own technology platforms, including personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations, and dynamic restaurant routines for general managers.', ""Stepping back, it's incredibly encouraging to see this digital ecosystem come to life in our restaurants. By the end of 2024, we are likely to have our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants operating substantially all of these key technologies through the Yum! ecosystem. From the Poseidon Point of Sale system to the Yum! Commerce Platform, our automated inventory management software, and the Tracks Restaurant Management application, truly a power brand powered by world-class technology. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.2x, down from 5x last year. As we had previously shared, we had planned for our net leverage ratio to drift lower during 2023 based on pausing new debt financing, paying our $279 million revolver balance in Q1, and retiring a $325 million bond maturity in Q4."", 'Our capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $103 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $225 million, reflecting $60 million in refranchising proceeds, and $285 million in gross CapEx. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 400, 000 shares, totaling $50 million. With the November bond maturity behind us, and no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we will return to using our excess free cash flow to fund the share repurchases and any accretive investments we choose to make, for example, the UK KFC acquisition. In addition, we were pleased to recently announce an 11% increase to the dividend. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value.', 'This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend, and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. Finally, let me shed some light on how 2024 is shaping up. Despite a more challenging operating environment, including the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, we expect to deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. This includes core operating profit growth to be at least 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. We have a strong unit development pipeline thanks to attractive and reliable paybacks and growth-minded franchisees, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong system sales growth. For the shape of the year, we expect top line trends in Q1 to be the most challenged, with same-store sales trends improving sequentially as laps ease and a range of sales driving initiatives take hold.', ""We expect full year, Taco Bell company operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. We anticipate flat, ex-special G&A growth as we manage spend across the organization. Remember that G&A can vary due to the nature of our performance-based compensation plan. Lastly, we expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%. To close, I am incredibly proud of our performance this year. Sales trends became a little more challenging in the second half, and yet we delivered profit growth above our algorithm as our teams quickly adjusted marketing calendars to meet demand and kept a strict focus on managing costs. It is our team's relentless focus to stay vigilant on all areas of the business that gives me confidence, we will deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024."", 'The unbeatable combination of our iconic brands, best-in-class franchisees, and resilient business model will enable us to deliver growth and shareholder value creation for years to come. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions.', 'See also Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 10 Stocks and 15 Cheapest Countries to Get Second Citizenship.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The company has begun adding kiosks to KFC Latin America units using its proprietary TicTuk platform, and expects to triple the number of restaurants featuring kiosks this year, Turner said. Kiosks will likely be in a vast majority of KFC stores by the end of 2026, Turner said during the company’s November earnings call. Kiosks are also being installed across Habit Burger restaurants.', 'Kiosks have been installed in all Taco Bell U.S. locations and are already making an impact on sales.

For all of 2023, Yum added the tech to 4,000 additional units, Gibbs said. Dragontail is now in 7,000 locations across Pizza Hut and KFC. This year, Dragontail will be added to nearly 6,000 more restaurants. Yum acquired Dragontail Systems in 2021 for over $72 million.', 'Yum’s custom-built SuperApp, which offers automated routine management tools for restaurant managers, is in 8,500 Pizza Hut restaurants globally. KFC plans to have it installed in 6,000 units in 2024, Turner said.', 'An AI-driven inventory management system is now in 90% of its KFC U.S. locations and about half of its Taco Bell U.S. locations.

The company will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that use this data and integrate it into its tech platforms.

According to ZipRecruiter, the share of job postings requiring a bachelor's degree dropped to 14.5% in 2023 from 18% in 2022. Additionally, 45% of employers surveyed by ZipRecruiter have eliminated degree requirements for certain roles over the past year, prioritizing candidates' skills and experience."", 'This trend is particularly pronounced among small and medium-sized businesses, where 47% are more likely to overlook college degrees as a requirement compared to 35% of larger enterprises. Sectors like healthcare and education are lowering degree hurdles to address workforce shortages, with 12% of healthcare job postings and teacher roles requiring degrees decreasing from 2022 to 2023.', 'Air traffic management and Nuclear Technology are two of the associate degrees in the US that are known to lead to jobs with high salaries. For example, the average salary of air traffic controllers is $130,840 and $97,040 for nuclear technicians. It is worth highlighting that associate degrees that pay high salaries are one’s that involve teaching highly specialized and technical skills and hence, are ones that lead to trade jobs. Radiation Therapy and Dental hygiene are known to be the most useful associate degrees in the US.', 'Skilled trades provide a major portion of the workforce in the US, with millions of individuals employed in different trade occupations. For instance, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there were over 6 million workers in construction-related occupations alone in 2020. These jobs not only offer competitive wages but also help bridge the skills gap by providing avenues for individuals who may not pursue traditional college education paths. Additionally, trade jobs often have lower barriers to entry in terms of educational requirements and can lead to fulfilling careers with high earning potential. For example, elevator and escalator installers and repairers, with a median annual salary of $97,860, demonstrate the financial viability of trade occupations.\xa0 To read more about trade jobs, see high-paying trade and vocational jobs in 2023.', 'From electricians who keep homes and businesses powered to plumbers who ensure clean water and functioning sewage systems, skilled tradespeople tend to play a fundamental role in daily life. The demand for these professions remains consistently high, with many trades experiencing steady or even above-average job growth rates. For instance, the BLS projects a 7% job growth rate for electricians from 2021 to 2031. As such, investing in trade education and encouraging individuals to pursue careers in skilled trades not only benefits individuals by providing viable career paths but also strengthens communities by ensuring essential services are readily available.', ""The manufacturing and construction sectors in the US are experiencing an increase in job openings, driven by federal investments and infrastructure projects. However, there's a pressing challenge: a shortage of skilled workers. In 2023, while the manufacturing sector added 12,000 net jobs, there were 601,000 open positions by December, hitting a three-month high. Similarly, construction added an average of 16,000 jobs per month. Yet, the industry needs to bring on an estimated 501,000 additional workers in 2024 to meet demand. This shortage is exacerbated by the retirement of baby boomers and fewer young people entering the trades. Without action, the Manufacturing Institute projects over 2 million manufacturing jobs could go unfilled by 2030."", 'Despite shortages in the manufacturing jobs, Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) has announced a reduction in production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, citing waning demand. Starting April 1, the company will decrease shifts at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, affecting 1,400 jobs. This includes relocating 700 workers to the Michigan Assembly Plant and offering options like placement in other facilities or a retirement incentive program as per the 2023 Ford-UAW contract. Despite the setback, Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\xa0 sold over 24,100 F-150 Lightning vehicles in the US in 2023, a notable 55% increase from the previous year.', 'Conversely, Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) is bolstering production for its Bronco and Ranger lineup, intending to add a third crew at the Michigan Assembly Plant, which will include 900 newly hired workers.', 'Speaking of layoffs, United Parcel Services, Inc (NYSE:UPS) recently disclosed plans to lay off approximately 120 employees at its Windsor facility, part of a broader initiative to cut around 12,000 jobs companywide. The affected workforce includes 72 part-time hourly employees, 23 full-time hourly employees, and 23 part-time supervisors.\xa0', 'These layoffs are scheduled for April 2, 2024, attributed to a reduction in volume at the Windsor location.

Firstly, we looked at degrees with overly generalized curricula with no specialization offered. Secondly, we focused on degrees with a lack of practical training. Lastly, we found degrees with a lack of transferability or advancement opportunities. After identifying these degrees, we relied on Reddit and Quora threads to filter the degrees which were repeatedly described as useless associate degrees. Based on consensus, we scored each degree out of a total score of 20 to gauge its level of “uselessness”. The higher the score, the higher the perception of being a useless degree. The list is presented in ascending order.\xa0', 'Here is a list of the most useless associate degrees if you want a high-paying job', 'IM Score: 5', 'The Associate of Arts in Theater Arts is sometimes deemed as one of the most useless degrees in the world owing to its broad scope, offering a general overview of theater rather than specialized training. It may lack intensive instruction in areas like acting techniques, stagecraft, or production management, which are crucial for competitive roles in theater. Moreover, without advanced coursework, graduates may find themselves unprepared for specialized positions. Additionally, the degree often focuses more on theory than practical skills, limiting hands-on experience.\xa0', 'IM Score: 7  The Associate of Art in Creative Writing degree may lack the specialization and depth needed for competitive writing careers.

A UPS spokesperson later said AI is not replacing workers, and that executives did not make an explicit connection between AI and the permanent layoffs on the company’s earnings call.', 'BlackRock Inc. last month said it would dismiss about 600 employees. In a memo to staff, CEO Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito pointed to dramatic industry shifts “and perhaps most profound, new technologies are poised to transform our industry — and every other industry.” While Fink has been outspoken about his belief in AI’s potential to turbocharge productivity, the new tech was not cited as a reason for the cuts. The asset manager still expects to have a larger staff by the end of the year as it expands certain parts of the business, according to the memo.', 'Experts struggle to get an accurate picture of just how many jobs are being eliminated as AI rapidly advances. Since last May, US companies have announced more than 4,600 jobs cuts in order to free up resources to hire people with AI experience or because the technology replaced tasks, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. But that estimate is “certainly undercounting” the true total, Senior Vice President Andrew Challenger said in an interview.', '“There are probably more jobs in the economy that are being cut because of AI already than are getting attributed to that or announced. Every time a company mentions it, they get headlines across every news outlet for like a month,” Challenger said. “They would rather go under the radar most of the time.”', 'Last spring, International Business Machines Corp. drove headlines across the world when Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg the company planned to pause hiring it thinks it could soon replace with AI. An IBM spokesperson said the company does not have a hiring freeze in place and plans to keep headcount level this year.', 'Johnny Taylor, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, agreed that many of these kinds of cuts will happen quietly.', '“IBM was a leader and was public about it, and got beaten up pretty bad,” Taylor said in an interview in December. “So the rest of them have said ‘We’re not going to announce it, I’m just going to do it.’ We’re going to reduce our headcount.”', 'Many firms may do that by significantly slowing hiring, he said. “We will wake up three years from now and see much leaner organizations,” he said. “They will have replaced you without making a big announcement.”', 'So far, most AI-related cuts have been in the tech industry, according to Challenger’s tally. Some companies, like homework help site Chegg and programmer help site Stack Overflow, cut staff after their businesses were directly undercut by AI products. Other companies, like file-storage service Dropbox, raced to refocus on the new technology, letting go of staff to make way for new hires with AI skill sets.', 'After IBM, only a handful of companies have explicitly tied AI to job cuts or hiring freezes.', 'In December, the Swedish buy now, pay later firm Klarna Inc. said it would freeze hiring as tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT cut down the time certain tasks take. “We need fewer people to do the same thing,” CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph. “The right thing for us is just to say: ‘let’s not recruit now, let’s see how this plays out.’” A spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment further.', 'In January, language-learning software company Duolingo Inc. chose not to renew about 10% of its contractors.', '“We just no longer need as many people to do the type of work some of these contractors were doing. Part of that could be attributed to AI,” a spokesperson told Bloomberg, adding that Duolingo does not have a hiring freeze in place and is actively recruiting for a wide range of roles. The company said no full-time employees were affected and that the job reduction isn’t a “straight replacement” of workers with AI, as many of its full-time employees and contractors use the technology in their work.', 'These companies aren’t alone in their thinking, even if others don’t say it out loud: Three out of four Fortune 500 chief human resources officers surveyed by Gallup last year said they see AI replacing jobs in their company in the next three years.', '“Let\'s not pretend — jobs are going to go away because of AI,"" said Bob Toohey, chief human resources officer at insurer Allstate Corp., adding that he was referring to the overall labor market, not his company specifically. “There will be jobs lost, and also jobs enhanced.”', 'In his own department, Toohey said AI will change the work of the so-called learning and development teams that train Allstate employees in, say, a new method of handling claims. What once was a three-week process of creating content can now take less than a day. “We are right in the throes of this now,” he said.', ""In the tech industry, some top executives have warned AI could eliminate certain jobs, with Elon Musk going so far as to say, “There will come a point where no job is needed.” But for the companies currently introducing AI to workers, there's often a more positive spin."", '“The big thing you’ll hear companies say is they’re not focused on elimination, but augmentation — trying to make people more effective and efficient,” Challenger said. “But clearly there are a lot of scenarios right now where one person could do the work of four or five people with the help of AI in a way they couldn’t a year ago.

This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast.

Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions.

However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$223m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. ', ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""Public companies currently own 21% of American Express stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together."", 'I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Banking relationships seem to be sticky, and the businesses that are able to better target younger age groups could gain long-term financial benefits.', ""Just because AmEx's operations aren't likely to change much, it doesn't mean there isn't growth potential. The business reported revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increases of 11% and 27%, respectively, in 2023. And over the long term, management forecasts double-digit gains for both of these headline metrics."", 'Robust tailwinds continue to propel this company. Personal consumption expenditures, which measures the dollar amount of what people in the U.S. spend for things, increases steadily over time. Inflation plays a role here.', ""The ongoing war on cash, and proliferation of digital payments, is another trend to be mindful of. Even in a developed economy like the U.S., cash still represents a meaningful portion of the average person's weekly spending behavior. In emerging markets, cash usage is higher. As spending shifts to cards, AmEx can benefit by bringing on more customers who will transact more often, leading to greater revenue potential."", 'Besides the growth algorithm, the valuation is a critical piece of the puzzle when trying to assess what returns could look like.

Founded in 1990, the company changed its name to Ulta Beauty in January 2017.The company offers a wide range of products including cosmetics, fragrance, skincare, hair care, bath and body products, and salon styling tools in stores. It sells more than 25,000 products from about 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points. We note that the company's skincare category has been standing out in particular for a while now, given consumers' rising consciousness.Meanwhile, the beauty products retailer also provides private label products comprising Ulta Beauty Collection branded cosmetics, skincare, and bath products. Additionally, the company operates a full-service salon in every store offering hair, skin and brow services. Additionally, it offers products through its Website, ulta.com, as well as mobile applications. The products offered by the company include the prestige and mass beauty brands.As part of its value proposition, Ulta Beauty provides a range of loyalty programs through its Customer Relationship Management platform. It also offers frequent promotions, coupons, in-store events and gifts. The company also makes use of a range of media platforms to advertise products as well as generate awareness. The company strives to boost distribution center capabilities to better support store footfall and online demand.The company has a strong vendor base and holds partnerships with companies such as Estee Lauder, L’Oréal and Shiseido. Ulta Beauty works closely with vendors to provide improved growth platforms for new and existing brands. As of the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release, Ulta Beauty operated 1,374 stores. For fiscal 2023, ULTA expects 25-30 net new stores, along with 20-30 store remodeling and relocation projects.(Note:\xa0 Zacks identifies fiscal years by the month in which the fiscal year ends, while ULTA identifies their fiscal year by the calendar year in which it begins; so comparable figures for any given fiscal year, as published by ULTA, will refer to this same fiscal year as being the year before the same year, as identified by Zacks)"", 'Bottom Line', ""Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Ulta Beauty ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today."", 'According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in February 2014 would be worth $5,820.86, or a 482.09% gain, as of February 8, 2024.

These factors boosted third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and net sales increasing year over year. A positive view of the beauty space keeps the company well-positioned. However, Ulta Beauty has been witnessing continued margin pressure owing to higher supply-chain costs and reduced merchandise margins, among other reasons.

But you don't have to invest in digital assets to set yourself up for potentially life-changing returns. Great companies abound in any market, even one that has been plagued by volatility, a reality that investors who have stayed with the market have experienced often in the last few years."", 'If you\'re on the hunt for great stocks to add your portfolio in the coming weeks, don\'t overlook these three names the next time you hit the ""buy"" button.', ""Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) continued to surprise some investors with its strong financial performance and resilience in what one could assess to be a difficult operating environment. Even as consumer wallets are constrained compared to several years ago, many people are continuing to spend money on experiences despite the rising cost of travel as well as geopolitical and economic unrest. While there are many companies that can benefit from these trends, Airbnb's platform offers a unique range of offerings that cater to all types of travelers and budgets."", ""This is likely a significant differentiating factor behind Airbnb's continued growth in a wide range of market environments. Whether a traveler is looking for a short- or long-term stay, an entire house or a single room, Airbnb offers options across hundreds of countries with little overhead cost to the actual business since it doesn't own or operate the homes listed on its platform."", 'The company also made steady strides to garner spending volume from all types of travelers and travel needs. These updates include heightened discounts on long-term stays, new stay offerings with the average nightly booking starting at just $67, improved search filters for guests, price-setting tools for hosts, and other perks for hosts and guests.', 'Active listings on the platform were up 19% year over year in the third quarter, while guests spent $18 billion in gross booking value, 17% more than in the prior-year period and 89% more than four years ago. Profits totaled $4.4 billion for the three-month period, while trailing 12-month free cash flow totaled $4.2 billion. This is a solid business with the financials to match, and one that investors might want to capitalize on now to benefit from its growth story in the years ahead.', 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX)\xa0continues to go from strength to strength with its market-leading portfolio of cystic fibrosis drugs, a promising pipeline of potentially disruptive medicines (many of which target rare or underserved diseases), and new approvals on the horizon. The company is the only one that has drugs on the market that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that afflicts around 160,000 globally at the time of this writing.', ""It also just won approval for the world's first CRISPR-based medicine to treat not one, but two rare blood disorders in multiple countries, including the U.S. The gene editing therapy, called Casgevy, was developed in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics and is a one-time functional cure for both sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT)."", ""Initial approvals affect specific cohorts of patients with these diseases. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Casgevy for SCD means that around 16,000 patients are eligible for the treatment, while the TDT indication affects around 1,000 eligible individuals. Bear in mind, there are approximately 100,000 individuals with SCD in the U.S. alone, so there is a tremendous market opportunity there. The financial impact of these approvals will take time to materialize. The process of preparing the patient and administering the therapy is deeply intricate and time consuming. It also involves obtaining and editing the patient's own blood stem cells before infusing them back in."", ""Vertex's next approval could be its non-opioid drug candidate for acute pain, which clinical studies have shown to be safe and effective in both surgical and nonsurgical settings, and for which the company plans to submit the regulatory paperwork in the coming months. For now, though, Vertex has a robust financial track record to fall back on. Its mainstay products bring in billions of dollars a year in profits and cash flow, also waving green flags for long-term investors."", 'Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) has certainly been in the doghouse with some investors, with shares trading down by over 60% from where the stock was a year ago. What seems to be the issue here? Well, a combination of mixed investor attitudes toward growth stocks, concerns about pet spending amid economically strained conditions, fluctuating profitability, and somewhat tepid near-term guidance have all had an impact.', ""Looking forward, though, Chewy's management has been clear that it believes the company can continue to expand market share and capitalize on consumer spending patterns. This would seem to be a fair assessment, given the continued overall growth of the business, the diverse lineup of segments that Chewy operates, and the general resilience of the pet industry as a whole."", ""While consumer outlay may fluctuate in challenging macro landscapes to a certain extent, pet spending is seen as an essential expense for most households. Chewy generates most of its top line from recurring sales rather than one-time purchases by pet owners. In fact, 76% of the company's net sales is attributable to its Autoship program, which allows shoppers to set up recurring shipments of products. Autoship sales jumped a healthy 13% year over year in the third quarter of 2023."", ""And 85% of Chewy's net sales in the recent quarter were from nondiscretionary and health spending by pet owners. In other words, consumers are still spending money on pet essentials, and Chewy derives most of its growth from this type of spending rather than discretionary pet purchases. The company reported net sales of $8.3 billion in the first nine months of 2023, along with trailing 12-month cash flow of $300 million as of the end of the third quarter."", 'The market may be underestimating this stock, which could be an opportunity for the forward-thinking investor.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Vertex\'s research and treatments have targeted the root cause of CF, which is that a particular protein becomes misfolded and unable to move chloride out of a cell, resulting in an imbalance between salt and water. Its scientists have been able to do this by working with the lung cells of real CF patients, an advantage over using engineered animal cells to simulate the disease-causing mechanism to determine which drug candidate is most promising for humans. Vertex\'s latest therapy, approved in 2019, is Trikafta, a combination of three medicines that targets a mutation found in 90% of CF patients. Vertex is now using the same approach to address other illnesses.

With its shares up by 99% in the last three years alone, one would be forgiven for expecting that this company is going to be slowing down for a while.', ""But, as it turns out, another massive catalyst is probably right around the corner, and it could make the other recent accomplishments look trivial in terms of the financial effect. Here's what you need to know about what's going on and how it'll affect your decision about whether to invest in the stock."", 'On Jan. 30, Vertex reported the results from its two phase 3 clinical trials of VX-548, a painkiller intended for treating moderate to severe pain. While the trials met their primary endpoint, which was to significantly reduce the pain experienced by patients after receiving abdominoplasty surgery or bunionectomy surgery beyond what might be possible with a placebo, they were not a total success.', ""The secondary endpoint, which was to prove that VX-548 was more effective at relieving pain than an opioid painkiller, was not reached, meaning that the candidate wasn't as helpful for patients as a low-potency opioid medication. Management hasn't indicated that there will be any attempt to do additional clinical trials to get more favorable results, though a phase 2 trial for the drug's ability to treat peripheral nerve pain is still ongoing and could yield positive findings upon completion."", 'The implications of the failure to meet those secondary objectives are massive for investors. Per a market research report by Precedence Research, the global pain management market was worth around $78 billion in 2022, $42 billion of which was derived from sales of non-opioid drugs. By 2032, that subset of the pain management market could be worth close to $80 billion, and the wider market is sure to be even larger.', ""But if VX-548 is successfully commercialized, it won't be able to access the entire market as initially envisioned as it won't be effective enough to compete against the opioid medicines on the basis of acute pain relief."", ""The company is now assembling its petition to regulators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the candidate's approval for sale. It hopes to submit the paperwork before mid-year. Since the program has both Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations, it should get its application processed a bit faster than it would otherwise, though it's a toss-up as to whether that means it'll be out the door before the close of 2024."", ""Investors should recognize that, assuming VX-548 gets approved (and based on the reported data, it probably will), it'll still take a couple of quarters after launch to get a good feeling for how much market share it's actually gaining relative to expectations. Nonetheless, news of the program's approval is likely to be a large catalyst for Vertex's stock."", ""Now, let's approach the question of whether Vertex is worth investing in, given its less-than-desired clinical trial results and everything else it has going on."", ""VX-548 has a massive market to approach. And as it's a brand-new solution in a challenging field where there's almost always a strong need for additional tools to put into clinicians' toolboxes, it is very likely that it will find some traction. The fact that it whiffed its original aim of one-upping the opioid class of drugs does indeed permanently decrease its addressable market."", ""But there's no point in focusing on the negative when there's still an abundance of opportunity on the table. Plus, commercializing the program will mark yet another success. It's a big step toward Vertex's longstanding goal of diversifying its product portfolio beyond its traditional fare, drugs for treating cystic fibrosis (CF)."", ""The rest of Vertex's portfolio is still going to keep yielding growth, too. Its gene therapy Casgevy for both sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta thalassemia just launched, and the company hopes to launch a total of five medicines by 2028. According to Wall Street analysts, the business is expected to bring in $10.6 billion on average in 2024. In the year after that, its top line could be as large as $11.5 billion. Given that it's strongly profitable, the company will likely be accumulating more resources over time as it grows."", ""Therefore, it's worth buying Vertex Pharmaceuticals on the basis of its pain program's probable future revenue. There's always the risk that regulators will have an issue with the application and require more work before granting an approval. But with the data it has in hand and plenty of income, any issues will probably be worked out as quickly as possible, so don't let that dissuade you from making a purchase."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Textron has a Value Score of B.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The product—also in Coke Zero Sugar form—will hit shelves in the U.S. and Canada on Feb. 19.', '“If you go to the aisles, you’ll see the amount of spiciness has gone up because consumers’ taste palates have evolved. We realized that could be an opportunity for us,” Coca-Cola’s North American marketing chief, Shakir Moin, told the AP.', 'Along with its spicy Coke, Coca-Cola is hoping to attract Gen Z customers with another new entry: Happy Tears Zero Sugar, a mystery-flavored, salt- and mineral-infused product that comes with a “hype kit” of stickers and apparel available only on TikTok until Feb. 17.', '“Gen Z is super important to us as a brand, as they are the next generation of tasters,” Sue Lynne Cha, Coca-Cola’s VP of marketing for North America, said in a statement to Fortune.', 'Coca-Cola is wooing Gen Z, a more health-conscious generation drawn to soft drinks trumpeting health benefits (amid reports of Diet Coke’s sweetener being linked to cancer), particularly as its eternal rivalry with PepsiCo heats up yet again. Analysts have foreseen that PepsiCo could soon retake the title of highest-valued beverage company, though Coca-Cola is expected to have solid fourth-quarter earnings. Units sold by PepsiCo’s beverage businesses were down 7% in December, while Coca-Cola’s rose 3%, according to YipitData.', 'Last January, PepsiCo launched its own Gen Z–friendly soda, Starry, which achieved a half-billion dollars in sales in its first year, more than forerunner Sierra Mist made in the past four years combined.

What’s the point of anything?”', 'This was a generation, after all, that contributed a historic rock anthem named ironically after the short-lived deodorant brand Teen Spirit.', 'The soda’s taste was, well, just okay. One consumer likened it to “carbonated tree sap.” The company sold just 1 million cases, and OK was pulled from the shelves by fall 1995.', 'Coca-Cola has embraced the absurd since then: Japan’s green-tea-flavored Coke debuted in 2009, and garlic-flavored Coke launched in 2022. In 2006, Coca-Cola Blak, a combination of cola and coffee, made a short-lived appearance before being pulled in 2008. Coca-Cola launched another coffee-infused product in 2019. Two years ago, Coca-Cola pulled its energy drink after an underwhelming one year in stores.', 'But Coca-Cola learned from its mistakes when making generation-targeted products. After yearslong dips in Diet Coke sales, Coca-Cola rebranded the product in slim cans, with flavors such as Feisty Cherry and Twisted Mango to appeal to millennials, who then preferred fruit-flavored seltzers like La Croix. After Coca-Cola released the new Diet Coke products in 2018, it reported a “return to growth” for the product.', 'In 2022, the company launched Coca-Cola Creations, a line of limited flavors and brand collaborations agreeable to Gen Z and their love of good vibes.

Y3000, a zero-sugar flavor developed with AI, joined its Creations line in September. Happy Tears is the line’s newest addition.', 'Coca-Cola Consolidated’s 2022 annual report suggested the Creations line has been a success, and was credited for the sparkling category’s “solid operating results.” With the brand’s recent success among younger audiences, it can have hope that the new spicy Coke will keep its bite.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The company’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.The company’s volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to have benefited from the ongoing recovery in markets. Category-wise, volumes have been benefiting from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Our model predicts year-over-year organic revenue growth of 8.8% for the fourth quarter, mainly driven by 6.9% growth of the price/mix and a 1.9% rise in concentrate sales volume. Consequently, reported revenue growth is expected to be 3.9%. For 2023, our model estimates organic revenue growth of 10.7%, with a 9.3% rise in price/mix and a 1.5% increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola’s fourth-quarter and 2023 results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. It has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture online demand, which is likely to have boosted fourth-quarter sales.However, KO has been witnessing inflationary cost pressures, related to higher commodity and material costs, as well as higher marketing investments. The elevated commodity costs have been hurting the company’s cost of goods sold (COGS). The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management anticipated inflationary cost pressures to impact several aspects of the business in 2023, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses. KO expects impacts of a mid-single-digit percentage from commodity price inflation on the comparable COGS for 2023. Our model predicts a 1.9% year-over-year increase in the cost of products sold in the fourth quarter and a 3.1% year-over-year rise for 2023.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth, with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. The company has been significantly increasing its marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers, and attracting new ones. This has led to increased marketing investments in the past few quarters. Rising marketing spending is expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the fourth quarter and 2023.Our model predicts SG&A expenses of $13.8 billion for 2023, suggesting year-over-year growth of 6.8%, mainly driven by a continued rise in marketing expenses. We estimate SG&A expenses to increase 4% year over year in fourth-quarter 2023. As a percentage of sales, we expect adjusted SG&A expenses to increase 40 basis points (bps) and 50 bps, respectively, in the fourth quarter and 2023.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt fourth-quarter comparable revenues by 4% and comparable earnings per share by 8%. The company also expects currency headwind to impact comparable revenues by 4% and comparable earnings per share by 6% in 2023. Additionally, revenues are expected to reflect a 1% negative impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes in the fourth quarter and 2023. Our model estimates revenues to be impacted by currency headwinds of 4% each in the fourth quarter and 2023.', 'Our proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

The Segment’s operating margin was 4.2% as reported, or 4.8% on an adjusted basis. Across the segment, we are managing production to align with demand and have significantly reduced inventory throughout the year. To contain costs, we have increased productivity, reduced overhead and implemented alternative formulations. In the U.S., we are expanding our distribution through our local service centers and offering new collections with premium Italian styling to improve our product mix. We have integrated Vitromex in Mexico and Elizabeth in Brazil and are enhancing our sales, marketing and operational strategies. In both countries, demand significantly declined last year due to rising interest rates and slowing economic conditions, which reduced our results. In Italy, we are optimizing our recent expansion of premium porcelain slabs to meet growing demand in both the residential and commercial channels.', 'During the fourth quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World Segment’s net sales decreased by 1.5% as reported, or 4.1% on a legacy and constant currency basis.

The European building product category remains under stress, with consumers remaining cautious and retailers reducing their inventory levels. We are investing in new products for 2024 while implementing tight cost controls. We are re-energizing our flagship Quick-Step brand with inspirational interactive merchandising displays. We are completing the transition to rigid LVT, and we have decommissioned our residential flexible line. Our wood panels performance has declined during the year from cyclically high pricing to a more competitive environment with excess capacity. We continue to implement restructuring actions in the segment and enhance our recent smaller European bolt-on acquisitions, including insulation, MDF boards, sheet vinyl and mezzanine flooring.', 'In the fourth quarter, our Flooring North America Segment sales declined 3.6%. The Segment’s operating margin was 8.2% as reported, or 6.9% on an adjusted basis. Reduced market volumes led to low industry utilization rates and aggressive competition in the marketplace. We are continuing to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to expand our distribution and improve our long-term growth. To enhance our business, we are making capital investments to increase our differentiated features and lower our manufacturing costs. In each product category, we are introducing innovative new collections, which are being well accepted. The commercial channel outperformed our expectations, led by the hospitality sector. We are leveraging our customer relationships to expand our needle punch flooring and trim acquisitions.', 'As we enter 2024, our industry is at a cyclical low and we expect seasonality in the first quarter to be more aligned with long-term historical levels. Our businesses are minimizing expenses, reducing overhead and restructuring operations to adapt to present conditions. We are continuing to invest in innovative products to increase sales and mix. We are reacting to competitive pressures to optimize our volumes as we pass through declines in input costs. We continue to manage our inventory and anticipate temporary shutdowns to align with demand. All of our businesses are implementing process enhancement initiatives to reduce the impact of inflation. Given these factors, we anticipate our first quarter adjusted EPS to be between $1.60 and $1.70.', 'During the past eighteen months, we have initiated many actions across the company to improve our cost structure, manage lower volume and integrate our recent acquisitions. Combined with these actions, improving industry conditions as we emerge from the bottom of this cycle should improve our results in the second half of the year. Markets anticipate that central banks will lower interest rates, expanding home sales, residential remodeling and commercial projects. The pace of improvement of the flooring category will be dependent on inflation rates, consumer confidence and the strength of home sales. We believe the U.S. and Latin American markets could improve before Europe, which could lag due to current geopolitical pressures. After past housing recessions, our industry has rebounded with increased sales and expanding margins for multiple years. Housing remains in short supply across all our geographies, and increased remodeling investments will be required to update the aging housing stock. Our restructuring actions, investments in new technologies, targeted expansions and recent acquisitions will enable us to further expand our business. As the world’s largest flooring company, we believe we are uniquely positioned to improve our results as the market recovers.”', 'ABOUT MOHAWK INDUSTRIES', 'Mohawk Industries is the leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.

Thus, investing in this sector is a good way to play broader economic strength in the U.S. and globally, depending not the company.', 'While interest rates have increased, driving mortgage rates higher, there are reasons for investors to be bullish on housing stocks. For one, a new cohort of buyers, namely Millennial and Gen Z households with young families, are increasingly looking to upsize in the market. Coupled with more Baby Boomers looking to downsize, this could result in a better supply-demand balance. Even though prices continue to rise, it is occurring at a slower pace.', 'That would be great for the Federal Reserve’s bid to tamp down inflation and for homebuyers overall.

Additionally, with more than twice the net income of its closest REIT rival, Realty Income is a juggernaut in its own right. This REIT owns around 15,000 properties, making the most of its scale advantages via accessing growth capital and engaging in larger deals. This reduces risks tied to net lease assets.', 'Last, with tenants like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) comprising 82% of its portfolio, the company’s triple net lease model protects against operational risks.

The massive conglomerate has its fingers in a lot of pies, from tech to insurance to healthcare.', ""Over the trailing decade alone, Berkshire has delivered investors a stunning return to the tune of 250%. For context, the S&P 500's trailing-10-year return sits around 240% at the time of this writing. Pull that window back another 10 years, and Berkshire has delivered a total 20-year trailing return of around 560%, while the wider market has delivered a return of about 545% in that time frame."", ""While individual investors won't have the capital at their disposal that the Oracle of Omaha does, that's all right. You can still become part owner of some of the companies Berkshire invests in, assuming those stocks align with your interests, investing style, and overall financial goals."", ""On that note, here are two companies in Berkshire's broad basket of holdings you might consider adding to your own basket of stocks in the near future."", ""DaVita (NYSE: DVA) represents just a 1% slice of Berkshire's overall portfolio as one of a relatively small list of healthcare stocks owned by the multinational conglomerate.

According to the National Kidney Foundation, kidney disease impacts roughly 40 million individuals across the country. As of 2018, around 786,000 individuals experienced kidney failure and required dialysis or a transplant, with the vast majority receiving dialysis. The dialysis market in the U.S. is valued at around $100 billion, with DaVita serving as one of the largest players in the space.', ""In the third quarter of 2023 alone, DaVita facilitated approximately 7.3 million total dialysis treatments. That's an average of 93,000 treatments every day. Revenue for the three-month period totaled $3 billion while operating income reached $496 million for the quarter."", 'Profits, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), totaled $247 million for the quarter and $541 million for the first nine months of 2023. DaVita also raked in a free cash flow of $453 million and an operating cash flow of $661 million in the third quarter of 2023.', ""The Oracle of Omaha has always stressed the importance of buying businesses, not stocks. While DaVita's stock performance hasn't been much to write home about the last couple of years, the stock has delivered a total return of around 96% over the last five years. This business has delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 53% over the trailing-five-year period, a sign that the company is increasing its value and managing investor capital well."", ""If you're looking for a stalwart health care company that can lend stable returns through the years rather than a lightning growth stock, this might be one to add to your list of potential buys."", ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire's single-largest position, representing about 46% of its overall portfolio. The tech giant has notably eclipsed the performance of the broader market through the years. Looking at the trailing-five-year period, Apple has delivered a total return of 352% in that time frame compared to the S&P 500's 98% return."", 'Apple remains an indomitable leader in the global smartphone market. In the U.S., which is still the largest market for Apple, the company maintains a whopping 61% market share. Estimates show that Apple shipped 232 million smartphones globally in 2023.', ""Moreover, Apple's smartphone shipments in the final quarter of the year totaled approximately 25% of all global smartphone shipments, more than any other player in this space. That's on par with Apple's global market share of smartphone shipments in the fourth quarter of 2022 but slightly up from its position of approximately 21% in the first quarter of 2023."", ""iPhone sales totaled $70 billion in the first quarter of Apple's fiscal 2024, up 6% year over year. The second-largest driver of financial growth was Apple's services segment, which brought in record net sales of $23 billion, up 11% year over year. Total net sales for the three-month period came to $120 billion, a 2% bump from the prior-year quarter. Apple's trailing-12-month profits stand at $101 billion while operating cash flow for that same period is $116 billion."", ""Another tenet of Apple's business that has been core to Buffett's investment strategy through the years is a company with a faithful habit of paying and raising its dividend. While yielding just around 0.5%, Apple has boosted its dividend by 120% over the last decade alone."", ""The company's history of innovation through all market environments while maintaining wide moats in key target segments is nearly unmatched and makes it a wise addition to any long-term investor's portfolio."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in DaVita right now?', 'Before you buy stock in DaVita, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DaVita wasn’t one of them.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."", 'D. James Bidzos', ""Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us.2023 marked another solid year of execution, delivering consistent financial results while enhancing our critical Internet infrastructure and extending our record of .com and .net DNS availability beyond 26 years. During 2023, revenue grew 4.8% year-over-year, while operating income increased by 6.1%. Shares outstanding at the end of 2023 decreased by 3.7% from the total of outstanding shares at the end of 2022.Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $926 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. Over the course of the year, we returned $883 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 4.2 million shares. At year-end, $1.12 billion remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration.At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 172.7 million domain names, down 0.6% from 173.8 million names at the end of 2022. During the fourth quarter, the domain name base decreased by 1.2 million domain names. From a new registration perspective, the fourth quarter ended with 9 million new registrations compared with 9.7 million names for the same quarter last year.For the full year, new registrations were 39.4 million names, down 490,000 names from the 39.9 million names we saw during 2022. The renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to be approximately 73.1% compared with 73.3% a year ago. For the full year 2023, the preliminary renewal rate of 73.9% is below the 74.2% renewal rate of 2022. Both first time and previously renewed names were lower -- rates were lower year-over-year.While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, declining demand from China remains the primary source of drag on the overall domain name base growth. Our domains under management from China-based registrars declined by 2.2 million names in 2023. China-based registrar demand has been weak as a result of several factors, including challenging economic conditions, a more stringent regulatory environment and the impact of a weaker local currency, combined with retail pricing adjustments.Excluding registrars based in China, our domain name base grew by 1.2 million names or 0.8% during 2023. While the domain name base thus far in 2024 has grown quarter-to-date, we have not yet seen any material changes in the current macroeconomic or regulatory landscape in China. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to expect China to continue to negatively impact revenue and domain-based growth during 2024. However, with the China-based portion of our base now at about 5% of our overall domain name base, we see the negative trend in China having a less pronounced effect on our overall business after 2024.For 2024, we're expecting the domain name base to remain flat year-over-year with a range of negative 1% and positive 1%. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.67 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names, which raises the wholesale price from $9.59 to $10.26 effective September 1, 2024. Even after this increase, we believe .com will be -- will remain highly competitive with other TLD choices. As a reminder, any of our domains may be registered for terms up to 10 years at the current wholesale price.Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I'll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks."", 'George E. Kilguss', ""Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $1.493 billion up 4.8% and delivered operating income of $1 billion, up 6.1% from 2022. Operating expense totaled $492 million in 2023 and was up 2.2% from the previous year. The full year 2023 operating margin was 67% and free cash flow was $808 million.For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $380 million, up 3% from the same quarter of 2022 and delivered operating income of $256 million, an increase of 4.4% from the same quarter a year ago.Operating expense in Q4 totaled $124 million compared to $122 million last quarter, and it was flat from a year earlier.Net income in the fourth quarter totaled $265 million compared to $179 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.60 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.70 for the same quarter of 2022. As stated in today's earnings release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 included the recognition of income tax benefits related to the items noted in our release. Cumulatively, these income tax benefits increased net income by $69.3 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.68.Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $204 million, and free cash flow was $199 million compared with $217 million and $209 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the full year 2023 totaled $854 million and $808 million, respectively.I'll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.58 billion. Operating income is expected to be between $1.45 billion and $1.65 billion. Interest expense and nonoperating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is expected to be an expense of between $30 million to $40 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $35 million to $45 million, and the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 24%.Overall, Verisign has continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the last quarter and throughout 2023, and we look forward to building on our strengths and our mission in the coming year.I'll now turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."", 'D. James Bidzos', ""Thank you, George. While demand from our registrars in China is expected to continue to remain soft in 2024, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We firmly believe our responsible and disciplined management of our business and capital continue to serve us well, allowing us to report another solid year, which in our view, is one in which we fulfill our stewardship mission of providing secure and reliable infrastructure services, manage our business responsibly and efficiently, and return capital to our shareholders.These goals remain unchanged and support our commitment to deliver strong financial results, including steady growth in revenue, operating income and EPS.Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird.', 'Robert Cooney Oliver', ""Jim, you pointed out China conversation. Obviously, that's on everybody's mind. And so I just would be curious to start just to get a sense from you what, if anything, has changed in China. You alluded to the more stringent regulatory environment, but would love to get a thought from you on that. And then I had a couple of follow-ups."", 'D. James Bidzos', ""Okay. Thanks. Yes, definitely, China is the main focus of the results that we had. I mentioned in my remarks that we saw a 2.2 million unit decline from China registrars and that we had 1.2 million growth from registrars outside of China. So the issues for us are definitely concentrated in China. And as I said today and have for several quarters, it's a variety of factors in China. Those are hard to predict. The challenging economic climate there, very difficult to predict what impact it's having, how long that will last.The regulatory environment is one in which the process of obtaining domain names is a little bit more challenging, a lot more process, a lot more identification, confirmation, authentication of the person registering, et cetera, process basically that makes it a little bit more difficult. And as we've mentioned for a couple of quarters now, foreign exchange is an issue as well. It increases cost of goods, obviously, for registrars selling domain names.So all of those things are contributing. It's really hard to say. It's an opaque market to try to understand. It's very fluid. There's a lot going on there. Some of the things that are going on, migration and other stuff are things, or shifts are making it difficult to really assess the impact. Is it at the bottom? Is it bouncing along the bottom? When will it change? Those are really hard to see inside of a very opaque market.And so in an abundance of caution, we just find it prudent to really be careful about guidance concerning China and where it might go. So those are certainly the influence, guiding to a flattish DNB, domain name base, as a result, and it's just really difficult to predict. But as I mentioned, we are reaching a point here where the China-based registrars represent about 5% of our zone. So I guess the impact -- if the negative impact continues at whatever rate, it should be less pronounced, as I mentioned."", 'Robert Cooney Oliver', 'Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Jim. And George, if I may, on that domain base guide of negative 1 to plus 1, how should we think about the impact of China within that? If you give us a sense of how we might ballpark that? In other words, just trying to comment out of the numbers? Is China moving beyond China to the forecast? Or is it starting to moderate? I know Jim just rightfully said, this is hard to predict. But I guess you have made some predictions. So just curious how we could ballpark that.', 'George E. Kilguss', ""Yes, Rob. As Jim mentioned, in 2023, China clearly was a drag down about 2.2 million units. And from a revenue perspective, which you'll see in our -- when we file our Q, our revenue from China was down about $14.4 million. As we think about the guidance that we've provided, both from a revenue perspective and a domain name base perspective, we're assuming that the impact that we saw here in 2023 is going to have a similar impact in 2024. And as a result of that, that's factoring into kind of the midpoint of our guidance of revenue and also factoring in to the midpoint of our guidance of the domain name base."", 'Robert Cooney Oliver', ""Got it. Okay. Very helpful. And then last one for me, and then I'll pass the baton. Just Jim, just wanted to see if there was any update that you guys have heard that we should be aware of about .web. I think you had that communication in late August, and you guys commented on the last call just about where things stood, but just wanted to see if we could get a refresh around that or if there's anything we should be aware of coming up?"", 'D. James Bidzos', ""Yes, thanks for that question, too. So there's not a new update on .web. I'll just reiterate what I said last time, which hasn't changed, which is that I can't publish their response to the latest IRP and they were very dismissive of it, described in detail, again, their process that they employed in determining the .web. It was handled properly in that there are no issues. And so what we're seeing -- what we've seen so far is basically process and procedure delays. And we are confident that that's going to come to an end, those will run out eventually. I just don't think that anything is going to change in the meticulous process that I can, again, concluding with the Board vote without objection to instruct staff to proceed with processing the .web application.Those were the last official communications of the Board in writing to the community and to staff. So we're waiting for some of these process things to clear up. We're watching the website. So nothing new from the last time. I'll just reiterate our confidence in what the outcome will be and reiterate our strong desire and exciting anticipation of bringing .web to market to our extended channel and to their millions of customers."", 'Operator', 'We will take our last question from Ygal Arounian with Citi.', 'Ygal Arounian', ""Maybe just to start, I'm assuming there's probably not a lot you can comment on the upcoming .com renewal, but if there's any chance there is something you could say or something you want to comment on, just figured I'd ask about that first."", 'D. James Bidzos', ""I'll just say that the .com renewal is based on a presumptive right of renewal. The .net renewal last year was similar and executed smoothly on to .com."", 'Ygal Arounian', ""Okay. Great. That's what I figured. For the global trends, understanding what's going on in China, you talked about the 1 million growth in domains outside of China. Can you frame that a little bit more? Is that typical? Is it still not what you would call kind of normal historical levels, understanding there's some fluctuations over time? What are the trends you're seeing globally that give you confidence or not? And if there's anything in particular that you could point on kind of maybe the U.S. or U.S. and Europe, it would be helpful."", 'George E. Kilguss', ""Yes. Sure, Ygal. This is George. So yes, as you just articulated, we did grow about 1.2 million domain names in our base outside of China. When we look at that growth, that primarily came from both EMEA and our all other segment, both of those were up. The U.S. was a little flat. It was down by about 500,000 units in the domain names year-over-year. But as a reminder, many of our U.S. registrars are global in their reach. So I wouldn't necessarily attribute all of that weakness here to U.S. registrants.But we do notice that U.S. registrants have been focused more on ARPU this year in 2023. So we think that can be a factor as well. But we did see good growth in EMEA as well as in our other all other segment."", 'Ygal Arounian', ""Got it. And then just, I guess, following down the line. I want to maybe dig into the margin outlook for next year and costs, less margin expansion, at least to start here on the expectation for next year than what we saw this year. Can you just talk about investments and where you're looking to spend next year? And then maybe tie in with that expectations around buybacks for next year as well?"", 'George E. Kilguss', ""Yes, I can help you a little bit with that. I mean, first, in 2023, our expenses grew by 2.2%. But I will point out that, that was favorably impacted by a $5 million reduction in fees paid to the government of Tuvalu. That went away here in 2023 as that contract transitioned at the end of 2022. So on a normalized basis, if you were to adjust for that, we would have been closer to a 3.3% expense growth rate here in 2023, which is still, I think, a good job by the teams in managing the expenses that they're responsible for.If you look at the midpoint of our guidance, that would imply about a 4.6% expense growth rate, which would be very similar to the growth rate we had back in 2022. So hopefully, that gives you some idea on the expense front. We -- we're always investing with our strategic framework in mind, making sure we're obviously protecting unconditionally, growing responsibly and obviously managing continuously. And so we'll continue to focus on that framework that has served us well over the past several years.As far as buybacks, we really don't guide to buybacks for a variety of reasons, as we've talked about. But I think you can expect us to continue to be responsible in returning excess capital to shareholders as we have done for many, many years here in the past."", 'Ygal Arounian', 'Okay. Great. And then last one maybe bigger picture. GoDaddy had an interesting announcement earlier this week, a partnership with Ethereum Name Service or ENS. And some of the stuff still on the crypto side goes a little over my head, but just wanted to get your thoughts on that, particularly because there was some commentary about the DNS and some of the challenges with integration there and just thinking about the kind of broader future of domains and how blockchain can impact. And maybe you have some views there.', 'D. James Bidzos', ""Good question. Thanks, Ygal. Yes. Well, this is really a positive development for the DNS. First of all, I don't want to speak for either ENS, of course, or GoDaddy. But what they did is make it easier to link a domain name to a blockchain address. So it's a very positive development for the DNS and it reinforces the utility of a domain name and the already strong value proposition of a domain name.We've spoken here for years about domain names as a stable global identifier, a unique, stable global identifier that that's the role it can play. And the reason we think a domain name is the right -- the best way to obtain such a unique identifier is because of the reliability, the maturity of the underlying infrastructure like the part that we operate, the well-governed, well-regulated space that determines -- registrars and registries are well regulated in how they behave, how they serve up IP addresses, what they have to do. That's all part of our contract. That's part of our requirement to perform 24/7 without fail.So they announced that domain names can be easily linked to ENS identifiers. ENS identifiers are typically linked to wallets holding crypto currencies. They're usually a difficult unintelligible string of characters. And there are other uses of ENS identifiers, but crypto currency wallets are a very common one. There -- so basically being able to link your domain name to it is basically using this domain name as -- and tapping the DNS space with its globally unique and stable identifier, all the benefits and the security that's associated with it, linking the blockchain spaces, I think, is a smart move and really good.It adds more utility and I think, significantly more value to domain names. And the linkage itself benefits from the cryptographic strength of the DNS like DNSSEC, the domain name system security extensions. So the ownership of provenance, the resolution of a domain name, all benefit from the underlying DNSSEC cryptographic protection to the strong public key infrastructure based things. You don't see a lot of this work that we do. And I think many of you probably know that my previous company, RSA, basically invented a form of public key cryptography and build out infrastructure, that was Verisign 1.0.And so this underlying secure, reliable infrastructure along with the well governed space is why people are navigating with the DNS, it's reliable. You're going to get where you want to go. And the ability to get a domain name, register it and have it activated and have it resolved is also well regulated. So having basically a unique, strong, global identifier that you can use for all of the coming services and applications as we get more connected, more active, is a tremendous benefit. I mean it's almost like that magical single password, you can use everywhere in the world. Wouldn't that be a dream come true for a lot of Internet users?In a way, a global unique stable identifier gives you that. And so this is actually a new Web3 type of application realizing that there's a stable and secure base out there that you can link to and get all the advantages of it and let people use those identifiers they already have. So we think this is really good news."", 'Ygal Arounian', 'Super. A much more thoughtful answer than I expected to be honest, but very interesting and the future of all that.', 'D. James Bidzos', ""Ygal, just to add, I mean, the reason for that is that we don't publicize a lot of the things that we do, but for years, we've been working on what we call responsible integration of alternate name spaces with the DNS for the very reason that we believe that at some point, the secure, well-regulated underlying DNS is going to be a better basis for a global identifier for folks and that rather than -- you can't recreate 35 years of innovation, building, weaving all kinds of high-value applications into the DNS.This is the part of the plumbing that people don't see that when we talk about operating and maintaining critical infrastructure that we do. So I jumped on your question because it's a great opportunity to point to something we've been quietly working on for a while, that's, I think, now adding real value."", 'Ygal Arounian', 'For sure. And maybe some under-appreciation of the innovation in the space. So very helpful.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks."", 'David Atchley', 'Thank you, operator.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with KMB.', ""Trane Technologies PLC (NYSE:TT), a global leader in climate control solutions, filed its 10-K on February 8, 2024, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial health and strategic positioning. With a strong presence in North America, generating over 70% of its revenue, TT has cemented its status as a dominant player in the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets. The company's financial tables reveal a robust balance sheet, with net revenues for the Americas segment reaching $13.8 billion in 2023. TT's commitment to sustainability is evident in its 2030 Sustainability Commitments, which aim to reduce customer greenhouse gas emissions by a billion metric tons. This strategic focus not only enhances brand reputation but also aligns with global trends towards environmental responsibility."", ""Brand Power and Market Leadership: Trane Technologies PLC (NYSE:TT) boasts a formidable brand presence with its Trane and Thermo King lines, recognized for quality and reliability. The company's market leadership is underpinned by a comprehensive product and service portfolio that caters to a diverse customer base. TT's strategic focus on sustainability has further strengthened its brand, with initiatives like the 'Gigaton Challenge' setting industry benchmarks. The company's significant investment in research and development, amounting to $252.3 million in 2023, underscores its commitment to innovation and positions it at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry."", ""Financial Robustness: TT's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic acumen. With a market capitalization of $43.6 billion as of June 30, 2023, and a solid revenue stream from both equipment sales and services, the company demonstrates strong financial stability. This robust financial position provides TT with the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives, explore strategic acquisitions, and navigate economic uncertainties."", ""Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Despite a well-established supply chain, TT acknowledges the risks of commodity and raw material shortages, which could impact production and profitability. The company's reliance on a wide variety of commodities such as steel, copper, and aluminum, sourced globally, exposes it to fluctuations in availability and price. While TT has a supply chain resiliency plan in place, the potential for limited availability or shortages in certain component categories remains a concern."", ""Geopolitical and Economic Sensitivities: TT's global operations expose it to various economic and geopolitical risks, including recessions, trade protection measures, and currency exchange rate fluctuations. The company's significant revenue dependency on the North American market could be a weakness if regional instability or economic downturns were to occur. Additionally, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical hostilities could disrupt TT's international business segments."", ""Expansion of Service Offerings: TT's growth strategy includes expanding recurring revenue through services and rental options. With an extensive global install base, there is significant potential to increase service contracts and maintenance agreements, which offer higher margins and customer retention. The company's focus on providing sustainable solutions also opens up opportunities to partner with clients on long-term environmental goals, further embedding TT into their operational strategies."", ""Technological Advancements: As a climate innovator, TT is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solutions. The company's investment in research and development is geared towards product sustainability improvements, which could lead to the introduction of groundbreaking technologies. These advancements present opportunities to capture new market segments and reinforce TT's leadership in the industry."", ""Competitive Pressures: TT operates in highly competitive markets, facing challenges from both established players and emerging competitors. The company must continuously innovate and maintain competitive pricing to retain its market share. The pressure to keep up with technological advancements and customer expectations could strain TT's resources and impact its profitability."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Changes: TT's business is subject to national, regional, and international regulations and policies associated with climate change and the environment. Changes in these regulations could impose additional costs or require significant alterations to TT's product offerings. Moreover, the company's commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2030 may necessitate substantial investments, which could affect short-term financial performance."", ""In conclusion, Trane Technologies PLC (NYSE:TT) exhibits a strong market presence, bolstered by its brand reputation and financial stability. The company's strategic focus on sustainability and innovation positions it well to capitalize on future growth opportunities. However, TT must navigate supply chain vulnerabilities, geopolitical risks, and competitive pressures to maintain its leadership position. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, TT can effectively exploit market opportunities and mitigate potential threats, ensuring long-term success in the dynamic climate control industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This maker of flow control and compression equipment is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.76 billion, up 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Please go ahead, sir.', 'Dennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our Fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.

After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.', 'At that time, some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance’s Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.', 'Now, I will turn over the call to Steve.', 'Steve Johnston: Thank you, Dennis and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We had strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, and I am happy to see that our hard work is reflected in the progress we are making. Net income rose $170 million to nearly $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $18 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities still held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up 78% or $157 million versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 42% higher than 2022. Our 87.5%, fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 7.4 percentage points better than in 2022, with the catastrophe loss ratio representing 6.5 points of the improvement.', 'That strong underwriting performance followed our recent pattern of improvement, resulting in a 94.9% full year 2023 combined ratio. That was 3.2 percentage points better than last year, including a decrease of 0.5 points in the catastrophe loss ratio. Our 2023 ex-cat accident year combined ratios were also favorable compared with 2022, improving 2.1 percentage points to 85.7% for the fourth quarter and 1.8 points to 88.4% for the year. We saw positive momentum in many areas of operating performance. Growth for consolidated property casualty net written premiums accelerated, reaching 13% for the fourth quarter, including 10% for renewal premiums and 30% for new business premiums. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance and to counter the continuing effects and inflation on insured losses, we combine pricing segmentation by risk with average price increases and careful risk selection.', 'Estimated average renewal price increases for the fourth quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment, again, averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the fourth quarter included auto, continuing in the low double-digit range and homeowner continuing near the low end of the high single-digit range. Policy retention rates in 2023 were similar to 2022, with our Commercial Lines segment down slightly, but still in the upper 80% range and our Personal Lines segment, up slightly but still in the low to mid-90% range. Briefly reviewing operating performance by Insurance segment, I’ll focus on the full year results.', 'Although I will note that each segment improved their combined ratios in the fourth quarter compared to last year as they continue to grow profitably. Our Commercial segment improved its full year 2023 combined ratio by 3.0 percentage points compared with 2022 and grew net written premiums by 4%. Our Personal Lines segment grew net written premiums by 26%, with growth for middle-market business in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business, its combined ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher than last year due to the catastrophe loss ratio rising 3.7 points. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment was very profitable, producing a 2023 combined ratio of 90.6% with net written premium growth of 14%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also very profitable.', 'Cincinnati Re’s full year combined ratio was an excellent 77.7%. Its net written premiums were 5% lower than in 2022, reflecting our opportunistic positioning of the portfolio through evolving market conditions. Cincinnati Global’s combined ratio was also excellent at 75.5%, with 22% growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary grew profit and premiums too as full year 2023 net income rose 15% and earned premiums grew 4%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2024 are fairly similar to 2023, other than an average premium rate increase of approximately 12%. The primary objective of our Property Catastrophe Treaty is to protect our balance sheet.', 'The treaty’s main change this year is adding another $100 million of coverage, increasing the top of the program from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Should we experience a 2024 catastrophe event totaling $1.2 billion in losses, we will retain $423 million compared with $617 million in 2023 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2024 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $180 million, more than the actual $136 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2023 due to additional coverage, rate increase and subject premium growth. Folks who follow our company know we prefer to track our success over a long time horizon. Consistent with that approach, we set a target for the value creation ratio, our primary performance measure, at an annual average of 10% to 13% over the next 5 years.', 'We believe the VCR is an appropriate measure since it’s driven by strong combined ratio results, premium growth that exceeds the industry average and contributions from our investment portfolio. Since 2016, our combined ratio of 5-year average has ranged from 94.3% to 96.1%, near the low end of the longer term target of 95% to 100% we have disclosed for many years. And for more than a decade, we have recorded results ahead of the industry for premium growth on a 5-year compound annual growth rate basis. Because we believe we can continue to perform at a high level we are setting our sights on a longer term combined ratio better than the past target, now targeting a 5-year average of 92% to 98%. While we will no longer publicly disclose annual targets for combined ratio and premium growth, we expect to continue our robust disclosure detail to help investors model and form their own expectations of future results.', 'This doesn’t mean that we’ll ignore the shorter term results. We recognize that it also means that to achieve our revised long-term target range, some years we need to reach combined ratios towards the lower end, knowing there could be some years like 2022 that come in near the higher end. I’ll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with the value creation ratio. Our 15.2%, 5-year annual average VCR as of year end 2023 exceeded our target range of 10% to 13%. VCR of 19.5% for full year 2023 included a contribution of 9.1% from net income before investment gains or losses while higher valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 10.4%. Now Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results and other important aspects of our financial performance.', 'Mike Sewell: Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income was a significant part of higher net income and improved operating results, up 15% for the fourth quarter and 14% for full year 2023 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income was up 7% for the quarter largely due to a special dividend from one of our stock holdings. On a full year 2023 basis, we added to the equity portfolio with net purchases totaling $14 million. Bond interest income, again, grew at a good pace, up 19% for the fourth quarter of the year. We continue to add fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $1.4 billion for full year 2023. The fourth quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.48% and for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 32 basis points compared with last year.', 'The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during 2023 was 6.13%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. Before tax effects, the net gain was $1.50 billion for the equity portfolio and $621 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of 2023, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.1 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $570 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income as did rising bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2023 was just over $2 billion matching last year.', 'Regarding expense management, we always intend to strive to an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. Our full year 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio at 30.0% was in line with 2022. While the fourth quarter ratio was 1.3 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to higher profit sharing commissions for agencies and associate related expenses. Next, I will summarize loss reserve activity. Our approach remains consistent and aim for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.', 'Our quarterly study of updated paid and case reserve loss and loss expense data for our commercial casualty line of business considered how fourth quarter incurred amounts were higher than we expected, especially for the general liability coverages for older accident years. To reflect the continued uncertainty of ultimate losses and loss expenses, we increased our estimates for several prior accident years to levels more likely to be adequate. The net amount of the fourth quarter increase was $51 million, including $29 million for accident years prior to 2019. Commercial casualty unfavorable reserve development on a full year 2023 basis was fairly small at $15 million. Only 0.5% of the year-end 2022 reserve balance. Prior accident year reserve development for commercial umbrella during 2023 and was a favorable $6 million.', 'During 2023, our net addition to total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $682 million, including $634 million for the IBNR portion. For full year 2023, we experienced $215 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.8 percentage points, marking 35 consecutive years of net favorable development on prior accident year loss and loss expense reserves. On an online basis by accident year, net reserve development for full year 2023 included a favorable $137 million for 2022, favorable $21 million for 2021, favorable $68 million for 2020 and an unfavorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. I’ll conclude with a few capital management highlights.', 'Another area where our approach includes careful consideration of the long-term. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not repurchase any shares. Our view of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both remain in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital continue to be under 10%. And our year-end 2023 book value of $77.06 per share means the $12.1 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders’ equity provides plenty of opportunity for profitable growth by supporting $8.1 billion of annual property casualty net written premiums. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Steve.', 'Steve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I’d like to comment on our recent leadership and Board announcements. Effective at our annual shareholder meeting in May, President, Steve Spray, will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I’m confident in his ability to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for associates, agents and shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board. We also announced the addition of Steve and Peter Wu as Cincinnati Financial Directors.', 'Peter has exceptional experience in the world of predictive analytics, data modeling and artificial intelligence. I’m honored that he has agreed to join our Board. Finally, the Board set the stage for a 64th consecutive year of raising shareholder dividends by increasing the dividend 8% to $0.81 per share. From the Board to the leadership team, to associates at every level of our company, we have the perfect people in place to create a bright future for Cincinnati Financial.

If you want to skip our comprehensive analysis of the car insurance market in the US, you can go directly to 5 States with the Cheapest Car Insurance In The US.', ""Car insurance operates as a mutual agreement between you and an insurance company. In this arrangement, you commit to paying premiums, and in return, the insurance company protects against financial losses resulting from accidents or damage to your vehicle. By paying a premium, you secure an agreement with the insurance company, and they commit to covering your losses as specified in your policy. These policies are tailored to individual needs and budgets, allowing you to customize coverage amounts accordingly. Typically, policy terms span six or twelve months and are renewable. The insurance provider will inform you when it's time to renew your policy and submit another premium payment."", ""In most US states, it's a legal requirement to have car insurance. If you cause a car accident, the auto liability coverage mandated by your insurance helps cover certain expenses. This includes the other party's medical bills and the repair or replacement of their vehicle or property damaged in the accident. Additionally, this coverage assists in paying for your legal fees if you end up in court due to the accident."", ""Many drivers get car insurance because it's a legal requirement, but it's not just about meeting the minimum coverage. There are several reasons to consider having car insurance. It serves as a financial safeguard for you and your family, preventing significant expenses. By investing a modest amount now, you can avoid hefty costs in the future. Quality car insurance provides protection for you, your family, passengers, and other drivers. In the event of an accident, having the right coverage ensures that you're financially prepared for property damage or bodily injury expenses. Dealing with the aftermath of a car accident can be time-consuming and tiresome. With proper coverage, you can sidestep the hassle of negotiating with other parties involved, managing repair or replacement costs for your vehicle, and handling various headaches that may arise. A comprehensive auto insurance policy not only assists with towing, repairs, and replacements for your vehicle but also covers damages to other drivers."", 'This year, auto insurance rates have seen another increase, and an expert attributes it to a combination of factors, including the higher costs of cars and parts, as well as a growing number of accidents. Scott Holeman, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, appeared in an interview on 25News where he pointed out that insurance companies incur higher expenses not only in repairing vehicles but also in dealing with legal actions arising from car accidents. Speaking on the matter, Holeman stated, “That litigation has a direct impact on insurance premiums. There are these high-dollar rewards in court cases. That’s going to be passed along to consumers.” He also highlighted that the prevalence of more technologically advanced cars on the roads is contributing to the overall increase in insurance prices. According to Holeman, insurance companies are incurring $1.12 in expenses for every $1 of premium written, essentially paying out more than they are taking in. He noted that the persistently high rates of accidents will likely keep insurance rates elevated in the foreseeable future.', ""According to auto insurance processing company CCC Intelligent Solutions, the average repair cost for a traditional vehicle currently stands at $4,437. For electric vehicles, the average repair expense is 49% higher at $6,618. This increase is attributed to the additional technological components in electric vehicles and the specialized handling required for their electric powertrains. Insurers have responded to the surge in repair costs, witnessing a 64% rise in the average collision insurance claim from 2018 to 2022, reaching $5,992 according to the Insurance Information Institute. To counteract the escalating repair expenses, insurance providers have significantly increased drivers' premiums. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that the cost of auto insurance in the United States experienced a notable increase of over 20% in 2023, marking the most substantial annual surge since 1976."", 'In the realm of US motor insurance, standout players include The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), Travelers Companies, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Trent Trujillo.

Our press release, supplemental disclosure package, and related investor presentation were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.udr.com.

When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone’s time and limit your questions to one plus a follow-up. Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered during the Q&A session today. I will now turn over the call to UDR’s Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.', 'Tom Toomey: Thank you, Trent, and welcome to UDR’s fourth quarter 2023 conference call. Presenting on the call with me today are President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Fisher; and Senior Vice President of Operations, Mike Lacy; Senior Officers, Andrew Cantor and Chris Van Ens will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. To begin, for this quarter’s call, we enhanced how we communicate our outlook for the year ahead. The volatility we have experienced over the last 5 years, combined with the supply-induced challenges our industry is expected to face in 2024 translate into a wider range of potential outcomes for this year versus our typical year. As such, in conjunction with our earnings release, we published an outlook presentation that highlights these potential outcomes and their drivers.', 'Our prepared remarks aligned with the presentation, and those on our webcast should see the slides on your screen. We will resume our usual format of prepared remarks only on future earnings calls. Moving on, key takeaways from our press release and our 2024 outlook are summarized on Slide 4 of the deck. These are first, fourth quarter and full year 2023 FFOA per share and same-store results met the guidance expectations set forth on our third quarter call. Full year 2023 same-store NOI growth of 6.8% was particularly strong and one of the highest amongst our peer group. Second, based upon consensus estimates, we expect that economic growth and apartment demand will remain resilient in 2024, but historically high new supply will continue to lay on our core growth.', 'Third, ongoing investments in innovation will continue to drive incremental NOI growth above the broader market in 2024 Mike Lacy will give you greater detail on this subject. Fourth, we are maintaining a capital-light strategy given our still elevated cost of capital, but we will take advantage of opportunities when appropriate. For example, in 2023, we executed roughly $1 billion of accretive deals through joint venture and operating partnership unit opportunities. We will continue to keep our eyes open for external growth and feed our cost of capital signals. And fifth, our balance sheet remains well positioned to fully fund our capital needs in 2024 and beyond. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Joe.', 'Joe Fisher: Thank you, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, including recent trends and transactions, the 2024 macro outlook that drives our full year guidance, and the building blocks of our 2024 guidance. First, beginning with Slide 5. Our fourth quarter and full year FFO as Adjusted per share of $0.63 and $2.47 achieved the midpoint of our previously provided guidance ranges. On the bottom half of the slide, you can see that during the quarter, we shifted to a more defensive operating strategy and build occupancy going into 2024. Occupancy trended sequentially higher for each month during the fourth quarter, resulting in a 20 basis point sequential improvement versus that of the third quarter.', 'As anticipated, this occupancy pivot resulted in lower blended base rate growth versus original 4Q expectations, but it was the right decision to place our portfolio in a position of strength given elevated new multifamily supply in 2024. For January, operating trends have improved. Market rent growth turned sequentially positive and is following normal seasonal patterns thus far. Blended lease rate growth improved to positive 0.2% with new lease rate growth of minus 3.6% and renewal lease rate growth of plus 4%. Concessionary activity continued to trend lower, and occupancy increased further to 97.2%. One month does not make a trend, but we are encouraged by these results. Moving on, as detailed on Slide 6, during the quarter, we executed a variety of transactions that both enhance our liquidity and set us up well for future accretive growth.', 'These include: number one, our joint venture with LaSalle acquired a 262 home community in Suburban Boston, were approximately $114 million at an initial mid- to high 5% yield. Through platform initiatives and various fees, we expect the stabilized yield to be in the mid- to high 6% range to UDR. We continue to explore investment opportunities with LaSalle, which will provide scale-oriented efficiencies to our operations, expand our fee income, and drive future earnings accretion and enhanced ROE for our shareholders. Number two, we sold our [indiscernible] on $180 million of dispositions. These are expected to be executed at a weighted average buyer cap rate in the mid-5% range and further enhance our already strong liquidity. And three, we assumed a DCP developer’s ownership interest in a distressed Oakland asset.', '1.5 years old community was appraised at $67 million or $387,000 per unit, which resulted in a non-cash investment loss of approximately $24 million to UDR. The community is still in lease-up and a submarket of Oakland were 2 to 3-month concessions or the norm. The initial yield on the assumed asset is in the mid-3% range. However, once stabilized, we expect the yield to be in the low 5% range. Turning to Slide 7 and our macro outlook. As in years past, utilize top-down and bottom-up approaches to set our 2024 macro and fundamental forecast. Our 2024 market rent growth forecast of roughly 1% was informed by third-party forecast and consensus expectations for a variety of economic factors that drive market run growth and our internal forecasting models, we combined this top-down forecast with a bottom-up growth estimate built by our regional teams as they best understand local supply and the demand dynamics in their markets.', 'Our 1% market rent growth forecast for 2024 is slightly conservative when compared to prominent third-party forecaster estimates at 1.7% and is driven by stable to positive demand set against historically high multifamily deliveries and the expectation for continued elevated concessions. As Mike will discuss, the approximately 1% rent growth ties to our assumption for 2024 blended lease rate growth. Primary variables to our forecast include GDP growth, employment and wage growth, changes to the homeownership rate, supply and its impact on pricing, economic uncertainty. Turning to Slide 8. If we step back and consider the near to intermediate-term outlook for the industry, we remain encouraged by a variety of key supply and demand metrics. First, at the top left, our consumer remains resilient with rent-to-income ratios at the long-term average.', 'Second, at the top right, relative affordability versus alternative housing options remains decidedly in our favor at roughly 50% less expensive to rent than own, a 20% improvement from pre-COVID. This supports a stable to declining homeownership rate and absent a major correction in home prices or a significantly more accommodated long-term interest rate environment, we do not expect this dynamic to change near term. Third, at the bottom left, the latest census data indicates that the largest U.S. cohorts remain in their prime renter years. This should provide continued support for future long-term rental demand. And fourth, at the bottom right, while multifamily deliveries are expected to remain elevated through at least 2024, starts activity is significantly retreated and is down 70% from recent highs, and is now well below historical averages.', 'This should benefit outer-year growth absent a near-term change in financing costs. Moving on to Slide 9. Third-party data providers are forecasting record multifamily deliveries for the U.S. and in our markets over the next 4 to 6 quarters. Based on completion forecast, peak deliveries are currently expected to occur in the middle of 2024 before trending downwards, closer to long-term historical averages in the second half of 2025. We are cognizant that there will be supply slippage as they move to 2024, and that lease-up concessions could remain elevated after new deliveries update. Positively, peak deliveries in the coming quarters are not materially above the levels we have seen in the second half of 2023, and into the start of 2024. When market level concessions move throughout 2024 will be a primary driver of our ability to capitalize on our market rent growth forecast.', 'On Slide 10, we provide more context on which regions and markets are expected to feel the greatest impact of 2024 supply. The Sunbelt is forecast to face significantly higher absolute deliveries than the coastal markets, although all regions will face higher relative supply in 2024 as compared to their long-term averages. As is evident on the bottom of the page, this dynamic is reflected at the market level, with Sunbelt market supply growth rates expected to be more pressured than coastal markets this year. Mixing this all together, we arrived at our 2024 guidance, which is summarized on Slide 11. Primary expectations include full year FFOA per share guidance of $2.36 to $2.48, same-store revenue, expense expectations that translate to NOI growth ranging from negative 1.75% to positive 1.75%.', 'Slide 12 shows the building blocks for our full year 2024 FFOA per share guidance at the $2.42 midpoint, representing a 2% year-over-year decrease. Drivers include a $0.07 increase of same-store revenue and lease-up income from recently developed communities, offset by a $0.07 decrease from same-store expenses, a $0.025 decrease on DCP activities due to a lower average investment balance in 2024, including a potential $0.02 impact from assuming ownership of a DCP development, dependent on the refinancing of its senior construction loan. While the developer continues to advance refinancing discussions, we have chosen to take a conservative approach by including the downside scenario in our guidance. We expect to have clarity on the refinancing by the second quarter and do not see additional 2024 earnings risk from our DCP investments at this time.', 'Continuing with the building blocks, and approximately $0.02 decrease from interest expense due to higher average interest rates and the expiration of certain hedges and an approximately $0.01 decrease in G&A, reflective of inflationary wage growth. Moving on to Slide 13, and specific to the first quarter, our FFOA per share guidance range is $0.60 to $0.62 or an approximately 3% sequential decrease at the midpoint. This is driven by a $0.015 decrease of same-store NOI, primarily due to higher expenses attributable to seasonal trends and approximately a $0.05 decrease of higher interest expense and G&A. Last, on Slide 14, we present our debt maturity schedule and liquidity. Only 13% of our total consolidated debt matures through 2026. The thereby reducing future refinancing risk, combined with roughly $1 billion of line capacity, minimal committed capital, our projected first quarter disposition and strong free cash flow, our balance sheet sits in an excellent position.', 'In all, despite near-term macro and potential DC-related headwinds in 2024, our balance sheet and liquidity remain in excellent shape. We remain opportunistic in our capital deployment, and we continue to utilize a variety of capital allocation better advantages to drive long-term accretion. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.', 'Mike Lacy: Thanks, Joe. Today, I’ll cover the following topics. How our 2023 results and other drivers factor into the building blocks of our full year 2024 same-store revenue growth guidance, an update on our various innovation initiatives, expectations for operating trends across our regions and our outlook for same-store expense growth. Turning to Slide 15. The primary building blocks of our 2024 same-store revenue growth guidance include our embedded earn-in from 2023 lease rate growth, our blended lease rate growth expectations for full year 2024, and contributions from our innovation and other operating initiatives. Starting with our 2024 earn-in of 70 basis points or about half of our normalized historical average, the 20 basis point increase in average occupancy we achieved during the fourth quarter of 2023 came at the expense of some rate growth, which reduced our earnings by approximately 30 basis points versus what I spoke to on the third quarter call.', 'We believe this is prudent, defensive trade given the elevated new supply outlook in many of our markets. Next, portfolio blended lease rate growth is forecast to be approximately 70 basis points in 2024. Given a midyear convention, rate growth should add about 35 basis points to our same-store revenue growth this year. Our expectation is that blends will be lighter through the first half of 2024 before marginally improving during the second half of the year. This dynamic, if accurate, means that blended growth should have less of a positive impact on 2024, but more impactful to our 2025 growth. Underlying our blended rate growth forecast, our assumptions of approximately 3% renewal rate growth in 2024 and approximately negative 1.5% new lease rate growth.', 'As a reminder, even during recessionary periods, we have seen approximately 2% renewal rate growth on average, which, combined with recent trends, provides support for those assumptions. Lastly, we expect the combination of occupancy and bad debt to be roughly flat in 2024. Moving on, innovation and other operating initiatives are expected to add approximately 45 basis points to our 2024 same-store revenue growth, which equates to $5 million to $10 million. The bulk of this growth should come from the continued rollout of our property-wide WiFi, other property enhancements such as the addition of package lockers as well as improved retention and less fraud. For retention, our guidance assumes that our 2024 resident turnover will be 200 basis points below that of 2023.', 'Half of this comes from the easier first half comp. As you may remember, long-term delinquent skips and evictions were elevated through the first half of 2023. We do not anticipate this repeating in 2024 as we have seen long-term delinquent activity stabilize. The other 100 basis point improvement should come from our proprietary customer experience project, which helps us improve our resident experience throughout their time with UDR, thereby improving their probability of renewal. We have seen the early benefits of this initiative with resident retention higher on a year-over-year basis for 9 consecutive months. For every 100 basis points of improved retention or reduced turnover, approximately $3 million drops to our bottom line. We believe our customer experience project will continue to improve our turnover and expand our operating margin advantage relative to peers.', 'Regarding fraud, we are implementing a variety of AI-based screening measures process improvements and credit threshold reviews to enhance our upfront resident screening. Given the resident-friendly legislation, we continue to see throughout our portfolio, minimizing the potential for bad debt before it gets in the front door is critical. Rolling all this up, our 2024 same-store revenue guidance range from 0% to 3%, with a midpoint of 1.5%. The 3% high end of our same-store revenue growth range is achievable to improve year-over-year occupancy, additional accretion from innovation, and blended lease rate growth that occurs more ratably throughout the year or at a higher level than our initial forecast. Conversely, the low end of 0% reflects full year blended lease rate growth of approximately negative 2%.', 'And some level of occupancy loss and delayed income recognition from our innovation initiatives. Turning to Slide 16 and our regional revenue growth expectations, we expect the coast will continue to perform better than the Sunbelt in 2024, led by the East Coast. The East Coast, which comprises approximately 40% of our NOI is forecast to grow same-store revenue by 1% to 4%. We expect Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia to each deliver full year same-store revenue growth of at least 2%. Signs of recent softening in demand in New York, leave us slightly more cautious on that market. The West Coast, which comprised of approximately 35% of our NOI is forecast to grow same-store revenue by 0% to 3%. Orange County, Los Angeles, and the Monterey Peninsula are expected to produce upper tier growth, while San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle are forecast to be softer.', 'Last, our Sunbelt markets, which comprise roughly 25% of our NOI, our forecast to grow same-store revenue by negative 2% to positive 1%. Austin, Nashville, Denver, and Orlando are scheduled to see some of the highest levels of new supply in which should continue to pressure pricing power. On a relative basis, we expect Dallas and Tampa to be leaders among our Sunbelt markets. Moving on, as shown on Slide 17, we expect 2024 same-store expense growth of 5.25% at the midpoint. This is primarily driven by growth in real estate taxes, personnel, and insurance. While only 6% of total expenses, insurance expense growth of 16% to 20% reflects the premium increase we realized when our policy was renewed in December. In terms of year-over-year expense growth guidance, the first quarter should be elevated due to a onetime $3.7 million employee retention credit we realized at the beginning of 2023.', 'This has the effect of increasing total first quarter 2024 same-store expense growth by more than 300 basis points. Additionally, for full year 2024, the costs associated with our property-wide Wi-Fi initiative amount to an incremental $2 million. Absent these two factors, we would expect normalized same-store expense growth to be in the low 4% range throughout the year or approximately 120 basis points lower than our full year midpoint. In closing, while the near-term operating environment presents some challenges, we continue to innovate with the intention of increasing revenue growth, improving resident retention, and further expanding our operating margin over time. I thank our teams for their collaboration and eagerness to leverage new and innovative tools to drive superior results.', 'I will now turn over the call to Tom.', 'Tom Toomey: Thank you, Mike. And as summarized on Slide 18, when we consider our potential 2024 growth trajectory, I come back to the key components of running a successful business. First is to understand your customer. Our residents have healthy rent-to-income ratios and relative affordability continues to favor apartments over other forms of housing. So we view the effect of elevated supply as transitory and expect that the demand versus supply dynamics will revert to our favor sometime after 2024. In terms of resident satisfaction, we can measure success through our customer experience initiatives and how they translate into greater retention, which has improved for 9 consecutive months. We expect this trend to continue.', 'The second component is the understanding of your associates. Through frequent discussions, surveys, and town halls, we have created an open dialogue and a culture that fosters engagement and innovation. UDR is proud and recognized leader in corporate responsibility as well. And third characteristic is to listen to investors. We are highly engaged, conducting roughly 500 investor calls, meetings each year. We are confident that we have a good read on what investors think we are doing well and where we can improve. From these interactions, we have created a company we believe is a full cycle investment and maximize value creation for our stakeholders regardless of the economic outlook. In 2024, we plan to focus on what we can control, namely, this means leaning into our operating platform and innovation, developing talent, nimbly adjusting our operating strategy in the face of supply and taking a capital-wide approach to maintain liquidity and balance sheet flexibility.', 'Taken together, we believe we can successfully navigate whatever macro environment we face moving forward.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Samantha Greening, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', 'Samantha Greening: Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. During the course of this call, we’ll be making certain statements that may be made forward-looking within the meaning of the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks and uncertainties set forth in today’s press release and our SEC filings. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC which are posted in the Investors section of the Company’s website at macerich.com.', 'Joining us today are Tom O’Hern, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Kingsmore, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Healey, Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing. And with that, I’d turn the call over to Tom.', 'Tom O’Hern: Thank you, Samantha. By now, it’s old news, but on Monday, we announced my pending retirement after 31 years at Macerich. Today is my 118th Macerich earnings call and my last. I will miss all of you, I would like to say I’ll miss all of you, but I’m not so sure about that. When I joined Macerich 31 years ago, it was to help Mace Siegel and Ed Coppola to take the Company public. We did that in March of ‘94. Our total market cap was a modest $650 million. Today, our market cap is $11 billion. We went from having a portfolio of malls in the mid-markets, doing about $350 a foot in sales, to a portfolio in major coastal markets doing $836 per foot in tenant sales. There’s been a dramatic improvement in the quality of the portfolio to say the lease.', 'We joined Macerich in 1993. No way and hell did I think could be here 31 years later. Nothing in my Iron Man background prepared me for a run of veteran. I will be forever thankful to my Macerich colleagues and friends for our collective accomplishments. Today, Macerich is extremely well positioned for the future as I pass the baton of leadership over to a man most of you know, Jackson Hsieh. He’s the right person to take the Company forward and to continue to execute on our strategy of densifying and diversifying our portfolio of top quality town centers. Regarding the upcoming leadership change, there is a detailed press release and 8-K on the topic, so I will refer you there. So the remainder of this call, we will be focused on the quarterly results and the guidance and outlook for 2024.', 'So now to focus on the quarter, I’m very happy to be leaving on extremely positive news. We had a strong fourth quarter, which included same-center NOI of 3% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Occupancy is now up to 93.5%. That’s a 90 basis point improvement over the end of 2022. We had a total shareholder return of 46% for 2023. That’s a top 10 finish among all REITs. We posted positive releasing spreads of 17.2% for the year. We had quarterly EBITDA margin improvement of over 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our partnerships sold a One Westside office building to UCLA for a pro rata share of $175 million to Macerich. We did over $890 million of financings that was closed or committed in the fourth quarter.', 'More on that from Scott in a minute. We signed over 4 million square feet of leases during 2023. That’s an all-time Macerich record, and that’s on the heels of the prior record, which was set in 2022. Portfolio average sales per foot was $836, down slightly from last year, but nonetheless a top quality sale activity. Bankruptcies continued to be at a record low. We continue to expect gains in occupancy and net operating income as we progress through 2024 and into ‘25. Also, keep in mind, as a result of the very strong leasing activity in ‘22 and ‘23, we have a very large and healthy leasing pipeline with nearly 2.2 million square feet of leases that have been signed but are not open yet. Once those 10 tenants open, it is going to fuel our NOI growth in ‘24 and ‘25.', 'And now, I’d like to turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the financial results, earnings guidance and the significant financing activity we had in the past few months.', 'Scott Kingsmore: Thank you, Tom. This morning, we’re extremely pleased to report a strong finish to the year. As Tom noted, same-center NOI increased 3% during the fourth quarter of 2023 relative to the fourth quarter of ‘22. When excluding lease termination income for the year 2024 same-center NOI growth, excluding lease termination income was a positive 4.5%. FFO per share for the fourth quarter was $0.56 and was $1.80 per share for 2023 for the year. The quarterly result was $0.03 or 5.7% more than FFO during the fourth quarter of 2022 at $0.53 a share and was in line with consensus estimates for the quarter. FFO for the year was in line with our most recently issued guidance, which was a midpoint of $1.80 per share. Primary major factors contributing to the quarterly FFO per share increase are as follows.', 'One, an $11 million increase in rental renews, which included a $13 million increase in top line minimum rent, $2 million increase in recovery revenue, which were offset by a $4 million decline in percentage rent. These trends are consistent with what’s been reported over prior quarters, they’re driven by improved occupancy growth and rental rate as well as a continued conversion from variable to fixed rent structures with CAM and tax recovery charges. Secondly, we had a $9 million increase in termination income. This was primarily driven by a single lease termination deal, which was a very strategic transaction that we expect will facilitate a major future redevelopment opportunity. These positive factors were offset by the following: one, an $11 million unfavorable increase in interest expense due to rising rates.', 'This figure excludes accrued default interest, which is consistent with our reporting over the prior quarter. And then secondly, a $4 million decline in noncash straight-line rental revenue, primarily from the conversion of GAAP to cash rents for the lease with Google at One Westside, which Tom mentioned we’ve disposed of as of year-end. To recap, as we have emerged from the 2020 pandemic same-center NOI growth, generated by our high-quality Class A portfolio has been tremendous, with NOI growth averaging 7.4% in both ‘21 and ‘22, followed by 4.5% same-center NOI growth in 2023. We are extremely pleased with our resilient core NOI growth during the past three years. This morning, we issued our initial guidance for 2024 funds from operations.', '2024 FFO is estimated in the range of $1.76 to $1.86 per share or $1.81 per share at the midpoint. Here are several details underlying this earnings fguidance. The FFO range includes an estimated same-center NOI growth in the range of 2.25% to 3.25%. In terms of quarterly cadence for our 2024 estimated FFO guidance, we expect approximately 21% in the first quarter, approximately 24% in both the second and third quarters and the remaining approximately 31% within the fourth quarter of 2024. Primary major factors that result in a reconciliation between 2023 actual funds from operations and 2024 estimated FFO are as follows: Same-center NOI is estimated to contribute roughly $0.10 of FFO this year. We had roughly $0.03 of FFO estimated from a relative improvement in valuation adjustments pertaining to our investment in direct investment in retailers.', 'And we had roughly a $0.015 year-over-year increase from the acquisition of our partner’s interest in Freehold Raceway Mall transaction, which closed in the latter part of 2023. These positive factors will be substantively offset by the following: one, a $0.07 increase in interest expense when viewed on a same-center basis, two, an anticipated $0.04 decline in land sale gains. We’ve spoken about this in the past. This decline is due to the robust disposition activity from our land sale program that we’ve undertaken since 2021 which is significantly depleted our undeveloped land inventory that remains. And then lastly, about a $0.015 per share dilutive impact from increased share count which is primarily driven from the Company’s various share-based compensation plans.', 'To emphasize, consistent with 2023, our 2024 outlook continues to reflect healthy operating cash flow generation of approximately $300 million after recurring capital expenditures and leasing costs, but before payment of dividends. More details regarding our guidance assumptions can be found on Page 15 of the Company’s Form 8-K supplemental that was filed early this morning. On to the balance sheet. Over the past few months, we have made considerable progress addressing our debt maturities. In December, we closed a $710 million five-year CMBS refinance of the $666 million loan on Tysons Corner Center. The new loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.6% and is interest only for the entire loan term. Also in December, our joint venture sold One Westside, as Tom alluded to, to UCLA for $700 million.', 'The existing $325 million loan on the property was repaid and approximately $78 million of net proceeds were generated at our 25% ownership share. In January, we closed a $24 million five-year bank loan refinance of the existing $23 million loan on Chandler Boulevard Shops. The new loan bears variable interest at SOFR plus 2.5%. And is interest only for the entire duration of the long term. In January also, we repaid the majority of the loan on Fashion District in Philadelphia, roughly $8 million remains, and that matures in April and is anticipated to be repaid at that time. In January, we closed $155 million 10-year CMBS refinance of the existing $117 million loan on Danbury Fair. The new loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.39% and is interest only during the of the 10-year loan term.', 'We are currently working with the loan servicer on a multiyear extension of the $86 million loan on Fashion Outlets of Niagara and we do expect this transaction to close later this month. Once closed on that Niagara extension, we will have a very manageable $400 million of maturities remaining in 2024 and across three separate loans. To recap the year, we’ve been extremely active in the debt capital markets during 2023 and year-to-date so far in 2024 across eight transactions, including Niagara, we will have refinanced or extended eight loans totaling $2.9 billion or $2.1 billion at our ownership share. This activity included a 4.5-year renewal and upsizing of our $650 million revolving corporate credit facility during the third quarter of last year and let’s remind ourselves that closing was amidst the regional banking crisis within the United States.', 'So we’re very pleased with our activity throughout last year and to start this year. A year ago, we anticipated improvement in the debt capital markets during the latter portion of 2023 given that the Federal Reserve was expected to be then near the end of its historic rate hiking cycle. And in fact, that expectation has proven true. We’re now finding significant opportunities to finance our assets within the sustained strong performance of our Class A retail. We also believe that we are benefiting from a rotation of financing capital away from the office sector and into the Class A retail real estate sector. Our recent transactional activity supports that thesis. In mid-November, we acquired our partner’s half share in Freehold Raceway Mall for $5.6 million and the assumption of our partner share of debt.', 'We now own 100% of Freehold Raceway Mall. We currently have approximately $657 million of available liquidity, which includes $490 million of capacity on our corporate credit facility. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment.', 'Doug Healey: Thanks, Scott. We closed out 2023 with very strong leasing metrics and leasing volumes. In fact, 2023 was a historic and record leasing year for Macerich, dating back 30 years as a public company. Year-end 2023 sales were down 1.8% from year-end 2022 and after a post-pandemic spike in spending across all retail categories, 2023 was clouded with increasing interest rates, inflation and the constant threat of a recession. In addition, we’ve definitely seen a change in spending habits with consumers now focusing on travel, dining out, entertainment and other various services. This doesn’t come as a surprise, and we expect 2024 to once again normalize and ultimately reflect more traditional consumer spending habits.', 'Sales per square foot as of December 31, 2023 were $836. That’s down slightly from $847 at the end of the third quarter, and that’s primarily due to a decline in the sales of electric vehicles. Trailing fall leasing spreads were a very healthy 17%. As of December 31, 2023, that’s up 660 basis points from the third quarter and up over 13% when compared to December 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter, we opened 391,000 square feet of new stores. For the full year 2023, we opened almost 1.6 million square feet of new stores, which is 80% more square footage than we opened during the same period in 2022. Notable openings in the fourth quarter include an expanded and newly reimagined American Eagle flagship at Tysons Corner Center; Five Below at Valley Mall, Levi’s at Los Cerritos, Pandora at Stonewood and North Face at Broadway Plaza and FlatIron Crossing.', 'In the digitally native and emerging brands category, we opened Beyond Yoga at Broadway Plaza, Purple at Los Cerritos, Warby Parker at Chandler and YETI at Washington Square. In the international category, we opened Aritzia and Intimissimi, Corte Madera, Lululemon at Freehold Raceway Mall; UNIQLO at Green Acres, Zimmerman at Scottsdale Fashion Square and Zara at Queens Center. Lastly, in the experiential category, we opened Camp at Tysons Corner and Round1 Spo-cha at Arrowhead Town Center. Now let’s take a look at the new and renewal leases we signed in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we signed 186 leases for 1.1 million square feet. For the full year 2023, we signed leases for 4.2 million square feet, and that’s up from 3.8 million square feet or 12% when compared to the same period in 2022.', 'And as I mentioned earlier, 2023 was a record leasing year for Macerich over the past three decades. Notable new lease signings in the fourth quarter include Buck Mason, Kate Spade, Mango, Maggiano’s and Level 99 at Tysons Corner, Round1 at Chandler, Dave and Busters at Freehold, launch in ShopRite at Green Acres, a second office lease with San Bernardino County at Inland Center, Arterex at Washington Square, True Food Kitchen at 29th Street and BOSS at Scottsdale Fashion Square. As always, our focus in the fourth quarter was in large part addressing our lease expirations, finalizing 2023 and getting a head start in 2024. In doing so, in the third quarter, we signed over 130 renewal leases with 84 brands totaling 475,000 square feet. With that, we’re basically done with 2023 and now have commitments on 44% of our 2024 expiring square footage with another 34% in the letter of intent stage.', '2023 was another year of newness for us. Once again,, bringing new unique and emerging brands was a major initiative for our leasing team and a way for us to really reimagine and differentiate our town center from our competition. To that end in 2023, we signed leases with over 80 new Macerich brands, totaling just over 600,000 square feet. Examples include Beyond Yoga, YETI, Club Studio, Shoprite, Level 99 and Maggiano’s, Elephante and Ketch, just to name a few. Turning to our leasing pipeline. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 126 signed leases for 2.2 million square feet of new stores, which we expect to open in 2024, 2025 and 2026. In addition to these signed leases, we’re currently negotiating other 80 leases for new stores totaling almost 600,000 square feet, which will also open in ‘24, 2025 and 2026.', 'So in total, that’s over 2.8 million square feet of new store openings throughout the remainder of this year and into 2026. And I want to emphasize, these are new leases with retailers not yet open and not yet paying rent, and these numbers do not include renewals. And I can tell you that this leasing pipeline of new store opening accounts for $64 million of incremental rent, which represents roughly 8% of our current net operating income and this incremental rent will continue to grow as we approve new deals and sign new leases. So to conclude, our leasing and operating metrics were very solid in 2023. There was only one bankruptcy in our portfolio in the fourth quarter and only 10% for all of 2023. The bankruptcies overall in both 2022 and 2023 were at their lowest levels since 2013, which is consistent with our significantly reduced tenant watch list.', 'Leasing volumes were at record levels. The result of which is a very strong, vibrant and exciting pipeline of tenants slated to open this year and into 2026. And as I’ve said in the past, and it remains the case, while there’s still uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, to date, we continue to see a little pullback from the retailers. And I think this is a result of the very healthy retailer environment that exists today as well as a testament to our best-in-class portfolio of super regional town centers. So given this and everything Tom and Scott discussed, we remain optimistic as we look to 2024 and beyond. And now, I’ll turn the call over to the operator to open it up for Q&A.', 'See also Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks and 10 Best Cheap Car Insurance in New Jersey for 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Matthew and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.', 'Jeremy Fletcher: Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. During today’s conference call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.

You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words.', 'The company’s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company’s latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. At this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckham.', 'Brad Beckham: Thanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the O’Reilly Auto Parts fourth quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman and David O’Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman are also present on the call. I’d like to begin our call this morning by congratulating Team O’Reilly on another strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our team faced our toughest prior year comparisons where we generated 9% comparable store sales in the fourth quarter last year, which represented our strongest quarterly performance in 2022. Against this very high bar, our team was able to deliver a strong comparable store sales increase of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'This was a direct result of their unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service everyday in each of our over 6,000 stores. For the full year of 2023, our team generated a robust 7.9% comparable store sales increase, which was at the high end of the revised guidance range we provided on last quarter’s call. This performance was also almost 2 full percentage points above the high-end of our original 2023 comp sales guidance range of 4% to 6%. We are extremely pleased with the ability of our team to deliver industry leading results again in 2023, especially since this performance was on top of the incredible sales growth in the preceding 3 years. These strong top line sales results drove another year of record-setting earnings per share as diluted EPS increased 15% to $38.47, representing continued strong value creation for our shareholders.', 'As strong as this performance was in 2023, I again think it’s helpful to view these continued outstanding results in a longer term context. To give some perspective, just in the last 4 years, our company has more than doubled earnings per share with our 2023 EPS 115% above the $17.88 we generated in 2019. After such an amazing run of performance, it would have been far too easy for our team to accept the idea that we may be forced to give back some of our growth. Instead, they did just the opposite, as our business accelerated in 2023. I couldn’t be more proud of our Team’s relentless dedication to outperforming the competition by providing the best customer service in the industry. As you would expect, the incredible momentum we built in our business this year has generated a lot of excitement for our team and that excitement was on full display at our annual leadership conference held in Dallas just 2 weeks ago.', 'Each year, we bring all of our store managers and field leadership, including our sales and distribution management teams, together in one place to build leadership skills, enhance product knowledge, share best practices across our company, celebrate award winning performances, and most importantly, set our focus on the year to come. Our conference theme this year was Leaders in Motion, which perfectly defines the focus and attitude of our team. It’s clear the energy created by winning with our customers and driving industry leading performance is infectious. And all of our leaders are passionate about taking the next step forward and seizing the opportunities in front of us. Now I’d like to take a few minutes and provide some color on our fourth quarter results.', 'As we discussed on last quarter’s conference call, we started the fourth quarter with solid sales results in line with trends we saw as we exited the third quarter. As we progress throughout the quarter, our results remain relatively consistent on a volume – from a volume perspective with each month performing better than our guidance expectations. As we expected, our comparable store sales results on a year-over-year basis faced pressure in December against very challenging comparisons the last 2 years when we capitalized on favorable winter weather. So far this winter, we have seen typical variability in winter weather with more of the harsh conditions that support our business arriving in January versus December. However, we are very pleased with how we finished out 2023 with broad-based solid performance across our core non-weather-related categories.', 'Our comparable store sales results were driven by strength on the professional side of our business where our team delivered yet another quarter of double-digit comp growth in the fourth quarter. Our professional performance was primarily driven by robust growth in ticket counts, and we continue to be pleased with our team’s ability to execute our proven business model at a high level and gain share through exceptional customer service. Our professional strength was partially offset by pressure in our DIY business, where we faced challenging ticket count comparisons to the weather benefits we saw in 2022 as well as a moderating benefit from same SKU inflation. Overall, the combined impact of average ticket growth on both sides of our business was a contributor to our comp growth in the quarter.', 'As we discussed on last quarter’s call, as we entered the fourth quarter, we had fully lapped the year-over-year inflation benefits that carried over from price levels that ramped throughout 2022. For the fourth quarter, our same SKU benefit was just over 1%, in line with our expectations. Next, I want to transition to a discussion of our guidance for 2024, starting with our sales outlook. As we disclosed in our earnings release yesterday, we’re establishing our annual comparable store sales guidance for 2024 at a range of 3% to 5%, and we want to provide some additional color on how we’re viewing both the broader economic conditions in our industry and the opportunities we have to outperform the market. As we progress through 2023 and now into 2024, we believe the fundamental backdrop for the automotive aftermarket industry is stable and the drivers for demand in our industry remains strong.', 'The daily transportation needs of consumers, generates robust and resilient demand for our industry, and there continues to be a very compelling value proposition for consumers to invest in the repair and maintenance of their existing vehicles. We have been pleased to see improvement in the total miles driven in the U.S. over the last several quarters and expect to see continued steady growth in this metric in line with our – in line with long term industry trends driven by population growth and an increase in the size of the car park. We also believe our industry has benefited and will continue to benefit from the increasing average age of vehicles as consumers show a strong willingness to prioritize investments in their existing vehicles to keep them on the road longer at higher and higher mileages.', 'From a broader macroeconomic standpoint, we view current conditions as favorable for our customers and in turn, our industry. We believe the economic health of the consumer is solid, supported by strong employment trends, improved wages, stable fuel prices and moderating inflation. However, our expertise is not in our ability to predict broader economic conditions. We remain cautious in our outlook regarding the potential for worsening economic conditions or the possibility of short-term economic shocks, particularly any impacts we could see from sustained higher price levels and interest rates, jumps in gas prices or election year volatility. As we have discussed in the past, we maintain our conviction that consumers in our industry quickly adjust to challenging environments and will prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles as a countermeasure in the pace of economic pressures.', 'Due to the resiliency of our customers and the nondiscretionary nature of our business, we have confidence our industry will perform well in 2024, even if the broader economy ends up facing challenges. While our outlook for 2024 incorporates our assumptions of a reasonably stable economic environment, ultimately, our performance this year will depend on our effectiveness in executing our business model, providing exceptional customer service and in turn, gaining market share. To that end, I want to spend a few minutes discussing how we view our opportunities on both sides of our business. We expect both our DIY and professional businesses to be positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth in 2024, with professional again expected to outperform.', 'We have been truly blown away by the incredible momentum our Team has generated with our professional customer base, driving 3 consecutive years of comparable store sales growth in the mid-teens. We were especially excited with the ticket count gains we saw in 2023 as our store, sales, distribution and office Team members delivered on our commitment to excellent customer service and industry-leading inventory availability. We remain bullish in our outlook for growth in professional in 2024, but expect comps to naturally moderate as we compare against the higher bar we set in 2023. We also believe we have opportunities to gain share on the DIY side of our business, but anticipate that any share growth in the DIY will come in the context of the long-term industry trend of pressure to DIY ticket counts.', 'We believe the industry dynamic of extended service and repair intervals resulting from increased complexity and quality of parts will drive down DIY ticket counts broadly in our industry. As a result, we anticipate DIY traffic will be flat to slightly down in 2024 with an expectation that we will continue to gain share to partially offset the normal industry drag on ticket counts. However, increased complexity and quality of parts also drives higher average ticket values, and we expect total DIY comps to be positive in 2024. For both sides of our business, we expect to see continued growth in average ticket values. However, our 2024 projections assume same SKU inflation will provide a smaller benefit than we have realized in the last 3 years.', 'Overall price levels were very much more stable in 2023 and consistent with our historical practice, we are assuming only modest increases in price levels from this point forward in 2024. As a result, our guidance assumes a minimal tailwind of less than 1% from same SKU inflation with overall ticket expected to be up low single-digits, driven by increased complexity. Before I move on to sales guidance, I would like to highlight our expectation for the quarterly cadence of our sales growth in 2024. On a weekly volume basis, our business is fairly steady in 2023, and we expect our quarterly comparable store sales growth to be relatively even throughout 2024 absent any unforeseen seasonal variability in weather and a minor shift from the timing of the Easter holiday in the first quarter of 2024 versus the second quarter last year.', 'We are pleased to be off to a solid start in 2024 aided by favorable winter weather in January. As I mentioned previously, we did not see much of the winter weather benefit in the fourth quarter. However, with the arrival of typical winter conditions in January, we would now view the weather backdrop as normal, and our assumptions underlying our sales guidance for the full year of 2024 do not include any material impacts from weather. Now I’d like to move on to discuss our capital investment and expansion results in 2023 as well as our plans for 2024. Our capital expenditures for 2023 were just over $1 billion, which exceeded the guidance range we updated on last quarter’s call and is approximately $200 million above our initial guidance for the year.', 'As we progressed through 2023, we realized incremental opportunities to further invest in our store and distribution network as well as accelerate our spend on certain initiatives to refresh our vehicle fleet and enhance our store image and appearance. For 2024, we are setting our capital expenditure guidance at $900 million to $1 billion. While our expected total CapEx will approach a similar level of spend as 2023, the composition will change somewhat. A portion of our capital deployment in 2023 was directed at restarting initiatives that were delayed in previous years and accelerating certain projects where we saw an opportunity to improve the image and convenience of our stores. Our 2024 plans anticipate a leveling of capital investment for these type of projects back to a more normalized annual spend.', 'We also expect to see a reduced CapEx spend for new distribution projects in 2024. We continue to be on track with our ongoing distribution expansion, and Brent will provide a status update on these projects in a few moments. While we still have substantial dollars to invest to move these projects forward in 2024, our anticipated investment this year will be below our spend in 2023 based upon development time lines for new facilities. These planned reductions in CapEx will be largely offset by an increased investment in new stores as well as continued strategic investments in technology projects and infrastructure. Our growth in new store CapEx is being driven by a shift toward owned store growth versus lease stores in our planned 2024 new store openings and future store development.', 'As we disclosed last quarter, we have established a target of 190 to 200 net new store openings for 2024 spread across multiple markets in the U.S. and Mexico. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores and are excited about our growth opportunities in both new and existing markets alike. We have a long-held preference toward own properties as we fuel our expansion in our ability to successfully open stores that increasingly generate higher sales volumes and stronger cash flows is driving enhanced returns on capital invested in our new store growth. One of the strengths of our company and a key factor in our growth story has been our ability to balance our organic greenfield growth across geographic – across our geographic footprint, which – while also supplementing our expansion with strategic acquisitions.', 'The most important factor in the success of our new stores is the ability to staff the store with highly trained professional parts people who live the O’Reilly culture and are committed to providing excellent customer service in their markets. Over the course of our history, we have been very fortunate to join forces with several great companies through acquisitions and our ability to partner with seasoned professionals, who have strong relationships with customers in markets that are new to our company has been paramount to our success. With this in mind, we are thrilled to have completed our acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto in January and are extremely excited to partner with their experienced leadership team to enter the Canadian market.', 'As noted in our press release in December, the company is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and operates as Vast-Auto Distribution. Vast-Auto is a highly respected family-owned business founded over 35 years ago with a company culture focused on the core values of hard work and excellent customer service. They currently operate 2 distribution centers and 6 satellite warehouses that support 23 company-owned stores, a network of strategic independent partners and thousands of professional customers across Eastern Canada. We are still in the very early innings of planning – of the planning process for our future expansion in Canada, and there will definitely be more to come as we grow our footprint. But for now, we are very excited to welcome the 500-plus Vast-Auto team members to Team O’Reilly.', 'In a few moments, Brent will provide additional details on our gross profit and operating profit results as well as our expectations for 2024. But before I turn the call over to him, I want to highlight our earnings per share guidance we outlined in our press release last night. We have established our EPS guidance for 2024 at $41.05 to $41.55, while we expect the Vast-Auto acquisition to be slightly accretive to our bottom line in 2024 it will not have a material impact on earnings per share. Our 2024 operating plans and earnings and profitability outlook reflects our continued commitment to investing in our business to grow market share and drive industry-leading results. We have been pleased with our ability to capitalize on our strong competitive positioning and generate robust sales momentum and will continue to judiciously manage our capital and operating investments to drive long-term growth and high returns.', 'Our entire team remains highly committed to our business and our customers, and we are very confident in our ability to build on the strong historical EPS results I outlined at the beginning of our call today. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O’Reilly for their hard work, dedication and performance in 2023. Now I will turn the call over to Brent.', 'Brent Kirby: Thanks Brad. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by congratulating Team O’Reilly on another great year in 2023 and welcoming our newest Canadian team members to our great company. We’re thrilled to partner with the Vast-Auto team to enter the Canadian market. Their experienced leadership team and excellent company culture, provide a strong foundation for our growth in Canada, and we view this acquisition as an important part of our strategic expansion plans. Today, I will further discuss our fourth quarter and full year operational results and provide some additional color on our outlook for 2024. Starting with gross margin, our fourth quarter gross margin of 51.3% was a 47 basis point increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 and at the high end of our expectations.', 'Our full year gross margin also came in at 51.3%, in line with last year and also at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, our full year results as compared to 2022 were impacted by incremental pressure we faced in the first quarter from the final impacts of calendaring our 2022 professional pricing initiative. Subsequent to the first quarter, our gross margin for the remaining 3 quarters of the year improved approximately 30 basis points from the comparable period in 2022. We have been pleased with our consistent solid gross margin results, especially in light of the mix headwind we faced from our outsized strong performance in our professional business. Our supply chain teams with outstanding support from our supplier partners have worked diligently to drive improved gross margins through incremental improvements in acquisition costs and distribution efficiencies.', 'For 2024, we expect to continue to see further expansion of gross margin as we calendar our gains in 2023 and drive similar incremental improvements as we progress through the year. We have established a guidance range for 2024 of 51% to 51.5%, which includes an anticipated 25 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of the acquired Vast-Auto business in our results. As we outlined in our press release, because of our new partner’s current mix of lower margin distribution business to independent parts stores, we’re expecting this headwind to consolidate gross margin, but only expect a net impact of 15 basis points to operating profit since they operate with a lower mix of owned stores and associated operating cost. Excluding the impact of adding the Vast-Auto business, our expected gross profit is projected to be up 24 basis points at the midpoint.', 'This reflects our confidence in the tremendous amount of focus our supply chain, store operations and sales teams have on creating a premium value proposition for our customers. Our quarterly gross margin remained very consistent throughout 2023 and we expect a similar quarterly cadence as we move through 2024. While we cannot completely predict what inflation will look like from a macro perspective, our current assumptions also build in a stable inflation environment, both as it relates to our product input cost and selling prices to our customers, as Brad outlined in his comments. During 2023, we saw puts and takes in the costing environment as a result of inflationary pressures broadly experienced by our supply chain partners, offset by our Team’s efforts to manage acquisition cost effectively.', 'We really view this as a normal state of condition for our industry and expect a similar rational environment in 2024. Our expectations also assume customer pricing in our industry will remain rational. As pleased as we have been with our incremental improvements to gross margin rate, we’re even more excited with our strong gross profit dollar growth, which saw an increase of 10% in 2023 and is projected for solid growth again in 2024. Our consistent strong performance is the direct result of a continued high level of execution of our business model and our unrelenting commitment to providing our customers with the absolute best parts availability in our industry. This competitive advantage is the direct result of our long-term commitment to making sound investments in our supply chain, distribution network and inventory position.', 'And we’re excited about the projects we have underway to continue to enhance our capabilities in 2024. To start on the distribution side of the business, we have three significant projects in development that will add capacity and service levels to our network, and I’d like to provide a quick update on our progress. As we have previously disclosed, we currently have new distribution centers under construction to relocate our existing Springfield, Missouri and Atlanta, Georgia DCs to larger, more efficient facilities. This expanded capacity will enable us to continue to support new store growth in some of our more mature core market areas as well as support the increased per store volumes that have grown significantly during the last several years.', 'Both of these projects are on track. We’re projecting the Springfield relocation to be complete in the back half of 2024, and we will begin the process of transferring stores to the new Atlanta facility at the end of this year. We’re also making great progress on the development of our new greenfield distribution center in Stafford, Virginia and continue to expect for this facility to be operational in the middle of 2025. It will support our expansion into these new untapped market areas for our company. Our distribution strategy directly aligns with the store growth strategies that Brad outlined earlier, and these new facilities will be key drivers of our ability to capture market share in both existing and new markets. In addition to the investments we’re making in our distribution centers, we continue to prioritize the opportunities we have to enhance our hub store network, which is the next level of our tiered supply chain model.', 'Our ability to support our stores with quick access to broad localized SKU availability is an important factor in our ability to effectively compete up and down the street. We continually evaluate this network to ensure all of our stores have the best access to inventory in their respective markets, and we will adjust the number, location and size of hub stores as necessary to achieve this goal. Every year, a portion of our capital and operating investment is geared toward this tier in our distribution model and our plans for 2024 are in-line with this continued commitment. Moving on to inventory. Our inventory per store at the end of 2023 was $575,000, which was up 4% from the end of last year, driven by our continued opportunistic investments to support our sales momentum.', 'In the coming year, our planned growth and inventory per store corresponds with the growth we will send – see in our distribution and hub network. For 2024, we expect per-store inventory to increase approximately 4% within our existing chain with the addition of the acquired Vast-Auto inventory, resulting in another 1% of per store growth since their model is more heavily weighted to distribution with a lower store count. Our growth objectives are focused on adding expanded inventories in our relocated DCs, augmenting the inventory availability in our hub network and capitalizing on targeted additions in our stores to ensure we’re offering the best possible local assortment and inventory availability. Now I want to spend some time covering our SG&A and operating profit performance in 2023 and our outlook for 2024.', 'Fourth quarter SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 32.6%, up 43 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022 and above our expectations due to higher-than-expected self-insured auto liability exposure and legal costs, driven by inflation and claims costs. Average per store SG&A expense for the full year of 2023 were up 7.8%, slightly above our revised guidance from the third quarter as a result of these same drivers. As we have discussed throughout the year, the outsized year-over-year SG&A growth as compared to our historical growth rates, was the result of planned initiatives targeted at enhancing our long-term operational strength through reinvestment in our stores, technology and our outstanding team. As we look forward to 2024, we’re planning to grow average SG&A per store by 4.5% to 5%, with approximately one half of 1 point of this increase driven by the addition of the Vast-Auto operations.', 'Our anticipated store growth in 2024 is a step down from the significant investment we made in 2023, but is higher than we would normally forecast in our initial SG&A guidance driven by a few key factors. Part of our anticipated increase in 2024 SG&A expense is driven by a year-over-year increase in depreciation expense directly related to our increased CapEx spend in both 2023 and 2024. As we calendar passed our prior year investments, this headwind will moderate as we move through 2024, especially as our mix of capital spending in 2024 shifts more towards new store investments. The more significant driver of our planned initiative-driven SG&A spend is our continued investment in our technology capabilities, both in incremental tools and infrastructure.', 'We’ve been pleased with the impact our IT investments are having on our business and the opportunities we see to support our growth initiatives as we move forward. Based on these expectations and our projected gross margin rate, we’re setting our operating profit guidance range at 19.7% to 20.2%. As we disclosed in our press release yesterday, this includes an anticipated dilution of 15 basis points from the inclusion of Vast-Auto’s results in our consolidated guidance. Excluding that impact, our guidance for 2024 brackets our 2023 results with the midpoint of our expected operating profit range down slightly from last year. Based on the anticipated cadence of our SG&A growth during the year, we expect more pressure to operating profit in the first half of the year than the back half.', 'As Brad previously mentioned, we are highly committed to growing our share of the market and driving industry-leading results. Before I close my comments, I want to join Brad in expressing the privilege it was to spend time with our company leaders at our annual leadership conference in January. Our team certainly had much to celebrate given their outstanding performance in 2023, but it was evident that our team is not satisfied with resting on our past success. Rather, they are intensely focused on providing excellent customer service and continuing to grow market share in 2024 and beyond. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy.', 'Jeremy Fletcher: Thanks, Brent. I would also like to congratulate Team O’Reilly on another outstanding year. Now we will fill in some additional details on our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2024. For the fourth quarter, sales increased $188 million, driven by a 3.4% increase in comparable store sales and a $71 million non-comp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2024, we expect our total revenues to be between $16.8 billion and $17.1 billion. Our guidance for total revenues includes the benefit from leap day in 2024, but this additional day will not be included in our comparable store sales calculation consistent with our historical practice. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 17.7% of pretax income comprised of a base rate of 18.9%, reduced by a 1.2% benefit for share-based compensation.', 'This compares to the fourth quarter of 2022 rate of 18.2% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 19.9%, reduced by a 1.7% benefit from share-based compensation. The fourth quarter of 2023 base rate as compared to 2022 was lower as a result of an increase in certain federal and state tax credits. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 21.9% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.1% reduced by a 1.2% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2024, we expect an effective tax rate of 22.6%, comprised of a base rate of 23.1%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other three quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods, also variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.', 'Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results in 2023 and our expectations for 2024. Free cash flow for 2023 was $2 billion versus $2.4 billion in 2022. The decrease of $383 million was the result of the increased capital expenditures Brad discussed earlier as well as an increase in net inventory in 2023 versus the substantial working capital reduction in net inventory we realized in 2022. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in income and a benefit from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to again be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. We anticipate the benefit to free cash flow from growth in our operating income will be offset by a headwind as we compare to the benefit we realized in 2023 from favorable timing of tax payments and purchases of renewable energy tax credits.', 'As Brad and Brent discussed in their prepared comments, in 2024, we have planned for capital expenditures and inventory growth at similar levels to the investments we made in 2023. And as a result, we expect a comparable impact to free cash flow. I also want to touch briefly on the component of our net inventory driven by our AP to inventory ratio. We finished the fourth quarter at 131%, which was reduced from the rate we saw through much of 2023. This moderation in AP reflects the timing impact of payments associated with the substantial inventory purchases we made at the end of 2022 to support our strong sales volumes and significant inventory additions as we exited last year. For 2024, we expect to see continued moderation and an impact from our Canadian acquisition and currently expect to finish the year at a ratio of approximately 127%.', 'Moving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.03x as compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by our successful issuance of $750 million of 3-year senior notes in November and borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by the June retirement of $300 million of maturing notes. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And for 2023, we repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average share price of $883.13 for a total investment of $3.2 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2011, we have repurchased 94 million shares at an average share price of $247 for a total investment of $23.3 billion.', 'We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance, Brad outlined earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to thank the entire O’Reilly team for their dedication to our company and our customers. Your hard work and commitment to excellent customer service continues to drive our outstanding performance. This concludes our prepared comments.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts fourth quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. I'd like to begin our call this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our team faced our toughest prior year comparisons where we generated 9% comparable store sales in the fourth quarter last year, which represented our strongest quarterly performance in 2022. Against this very high bar, our team was able to deliver a strong comparable store sales increase of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was a direct result of their unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service every day in each of our over 6,000 stores. For the full year of 2023, our team generated a robust 7.9% comparable store sales increase, which was at the high end of the revised guidance range we provided on last quarter's call. This performance was also almost 2 full percentage points above the high end of our original 2023 comp sales guidance range of 4% to 6%. We're extremely pleased with the ability of our team to deliver industry-leading results again in 2023, especially since this performance was on top of the incredible sales growth in the preceding 3 years. These strong top line sales results drove another year of record-setting earnings per share as diluted EPS increased 15% to $38.47, representing continued strong value creation for our shareholders. As strong as this performance was in 2023, I again think it's helpful to view these continued outstanding results in a longer-term context. To give some perspective, just in the last 4 years, our company has more than doubled earnings per share with our 2023 EPS 115% above the $17.88 we generated in 2019. After such an amazing run of performance, it would have been far too easy for our team to accept the idea that we may be forced to give back some of our growth. Instead, they did just the opposite, as our business accelerated in 2023. I couldn't be more proud of our Team's relentless dedication to outperforming the competition by providing the best customer service in the industry. As you'd expect, the incredible momentum we built in our business this year has generated a lot of excitement for our team, and that excitement was on full display at our annual leadership conference held in Dallas just 2 weeks ago. Each year, we bring all of our store managers and field leadership, including our sales and distribution management teams, together in one place to build leadership skills, enhance product knowledge, share best practices across our company, celebrate award-winning performances and most importantly, set our focus on the year to come. Our conference theme this year was Leaders in Motion, which perfectly defines the focus and attitude of our team. It's clear the energy created by winning with our customers and driving industry-leading performance is infectious. And all of our leaders are passionate about taking the next step forward and seizing the opportunities in front of us. Now I'd like to take a few minutes and provide some color on our fourth quarter results. As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we started the fourth quarter with solid sales results in line with trends we saw as we exited the third quarter. As we progress throughout the quarter, our results remain relatively consistent on a volume -- from a volume perspective with each month performing better than our guidance expectations. As we expected, our comparable store sales results on a year-over-year basis faced pressure in December against very challenging comparisons the last 2 years when we capitalized on favorable winter weather. So far this winter, we have seen typical variability in winter weather with more of the harsh conditions that support our business arriving in January versus December. However, we are very pleased with how we finished out 2023 with broad-based solid performance across our core nonweather-related categories. Our comparable store sales results were driven by strength on the professional side of our business where our team delivered yet another quarter of double-digit comp growth in the fourth quarter. Our professional performance was primarily driven by robust growth in ticket counts, and we continue to be pleased with our team's ability to execute our proven business model at a high level and gain share through exceptional customer service. Our professional strength was partially offset by pressure in our DIY business, where we faced challenging ticket count comparisons to the weather benefits we saw in 2022 as well as a moderating benefit from same SKU inflation. Overall, the combined impact of average ticket growth on both sides of our business was a contributor to our comp growth in the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, as we entered the fourth quarter, we had fully lapped the year-over-year inflation benefits that carried over from price levels that ramped throughout 2022. For the fourth quarter, our same SKU benefit was just over 1%, in line with our expectations. Next, I want to transition to a discussion of our guidance for 2024, starting with our sales outlook. As we disclosed in our earnings release yesterday, we're establishing our annual comparable store sales guidance for 2024 at a range of 3% to 5%, and we want to provide some additional color on how we're viewing both the broader economic conditions in our industry and the opportunities we have to outperform the market. As we progress through 2023 and now into 2024, we believe the fundamental backdrop for the automotive aftermarket industry is stable and the drivers for demand in our industry remains strong. The daily transportation needs of consumers generates robust and resilient demand for our industry, and there continues to be a very compelling value proposition for consumers to invest in the repair and maintenance of their existing vehicles. We've been pleased to see improvement in the total miles driven in the U.S. over the last several quarters and expect to see continued steady growth in this metric in line with our -- in line with long term industry trends driven by population growth and an increase in the size of the car park. We also believe our industry has benefited and will continue to benefit from the increasing average age of vehicles as consumers show a strong willingness to prioritize investments in their existing vehicles to keep them on the road longer at higher and higher mileages. From a broader macroeconomic standpoint, we view current conditions as favorable for our customers and in turn, our industry. We believe the economic health of the consumer is solid, supported by strong employment trends, improved wages, stable fuel prices and moderating inflation. However, our expertise is not in our ability to predict broader economic conditions. We remain cautious in our outlook regarding the potential for worsening economic conditions or the possibility of short-term economic shocks, particularly any impacts we could see from sustained higher price levels and interest rates, jumps in gas prices or election year volatility. As we have discussed in the past, we maintain our conviction that consumers in our industry quickly adjust to challenging environments and will prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles as a countermeasure in the pace of economic pressures. Due to the resiliency of our customers and the nondiscretionary nature of our business, we have confidence our industry will perform well in 2024, even if the broader economy ends up facing challenges. While our outlook for 2024 incorporates our assumptions of a reasonably stable economic environment, ultimately, our performance this year will depend on our effectiveness in executing our business model, providing exceptional customer service and in turn, gaining market share. To that end, I want to spend a few minutes discussing how we view our opportunities on both sides of our business. We expect both our DIY and professional businesses to be positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth in 2024, with professional again expected to outperform. We have been truly blown away by the incredible momentum our Team has generated with our professional customer base, driving 3 consecutive years of comparable store sales growth in the mid-teens. We were especially excited with the ticket count gains we saw in 2023 as our store, sales, distribution and office Team members delivered on our commitment to excellent customer service and industry-leading inventory availability. We remain bullish in our outlook for growth in professional in 2024, but expect comps to naturally moderate as we compare against the higher bar we set in 2023. We also believe we have opportunities to gain share on the DIY side of our business, but anticipate that any share growth in the DIY will come in the context of the long-term industry trend of pressure to DIY ticket counts. We believe the industry dynamic of extended service and repair intervals resulting from increased complexity and quality of parts will drive down DIY ticket counts broadly in our industry. As a result, we anticipate DIY traffic will be flat to slightly down in 2024 with an expectation that we will continue to gain share to partially offset the normal industry drag on ticket counts. However, increased complexity and quality of parts also drives higher average ticket values, and we expect total DIY comps to be positive in 2024. For both sides of our business, we expect to see continued growth in average ticket values. However, our 2024 projections assume same SKU inflation will provide a smaller benefit than we have realized in the last 3 years. Overall price levels were very much more stable in 2023 and consistent with our historical practice, we are assuming only modest increases in price levels from this point forward in 2024. As a result, our guidance assumes a minimal tailwind of less than 1% from same SKU inflation with overall ticket expected to be up low single digits, driven by increased complexity. Before I move on to sales guidance, I would like to highlight our expectation for the quarterly cadence of our sales growth in 2024. On a weekly volume basis, our business is fairly steady in 2023, and we expect our quarterly comparable store sales growth to be relatively even throughout 2024 absent any unforeseen seasonal variability in weather and a minor shift from the timing of the Easter holiday in the first quarter of 2024 versus the second quarter last year. We are pleased to be off to a solid start in 2024 aided by favorable winter weather in January. As I mentioned previously, we did not see much of the winter weather benefit in the fourth quarter. However, with the arrival of typical winter conditions in January, we would now view the weather backdrop as normal, and our assumptions underlying our sales guidance for the full year of 2024 do not include any material impacts from weather. Now I'd like to move on to discuss our capital investment and expansion results in 2023 as well as our plans for 2024. Our capital expenditures for 2023 were just over $1 billion, which exceeded the guidance range we updated on last quarter's call and is approximately $200 million above our initial guidance for the year. As we progressed through 2023, we realized incremental opportunities to further invest in our store and distribution network as well as accelerate our spend on certain initiatives to refresh our vehicle fleet and enhance our store image and appearance. For 2024, we're setting our capital expenditure guidance at $900 million to $1 billion. While our expected total CapEx will approach a similar level of spend as 2023, the composition will change somewhat. A portion of our capital deployment in 2023 was directed at restarting initiatives that were delayed in previous years and accelerating certain projects where we saw an opportunity to improve the image and convenience of our stores. Our 2024 plans anticipate a leveling of capital investment for these type of projects back to a more normalized annual spend. We also expect to see a reduced CapEx spend for new distribution projects in 2024. We continue to be on track with our ongoing distribution expansion, and Brent will provide a status update on these projects in a few moments. While we still have substantial dollars to invest to move these projects forward in 2024, our anticipated investment this year will be below our spend in 2023 based upon development time lines for new facilities. These planned reductions in CapEx will be largely offset by an increased investment in new stores as well as continued strategic investments in technology projects and infrastructure. Our growth in new store CapEx is being driven by a shift toward owned store growth versus lease stores in our planned 2024 new store openings and future store development. As we disclosed last quarter, we have established a target of 190 to 200 net new store openings for 2024 spread across multiple markets in the U.S. and Mexico. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores and are excited about our growth opportunities in both new and existing markets alike. We have a long-held preference toward own properties as we fuel our expansion in our ability to successfully open stores that increasingly generate higher sales volumes and stronger cash flows is driving enhanced returns on capital invested in our new store growth. One of the strengths of our company and a key factor in our growth story has been our ability to balance our organic greenfield growth across geographic -- across our geographic footprint, which -- while also supplementing our expansion with strategic acquisitions. The most important factor in the success of our new stores is the ability to staff the store with highly trained professional parts people who live the O'Reilly culture and are committed to providing excellent customer service in their markets. Over the course of our history, we have been very fortunate to join forces with several great companies through acquisitions and our ability to partner with seasoned professionals, who have strong relationships with customers in markets that are new to our company has been paramount to our success.With this in mind, we are thrilled to have completed our acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto in January and are extremely excited to partner with their experienced leadership team to enter the Canadian market. As noted in our press release in December, the company is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and operates as Vast-Auto Distribution. Vast-Auto is a highly respected family-owned business founded over 35 years ago with a company culture focused on the core values of hard work and excellent customer service. They currently operate 2 distribution centers and 6 satellite warehouses that support 23 company-owned stores, a network of strategic independent partners and thousands of professional customers across Eastern Canada. We are still in the very early innings of planning -- of the planning process for our future expansion in Canada, and there will definitely be more to come as we grow our footprint. But for now, we are very excited to welcome the 500-plus Vast-Auto team members to Team O'Reilly. In a few moments, Brent will provide additional details on our gross profit and operating profit results as well as our expectations for 2024. But before I turn the call over to him, I want to highlight our earnings per share guidance we outlined in our press release last night. We have established our EPS guidance for 2024 at $41.05 to $41.55, while we expect the Vast-Auto acquisition to be slightly accretive to our bottom line in 2024, it will not have a material impact on earnings per share. Our 2024 operating plans and earnings and profitability outlook reflects our continued commitment to investing in our business to grow market share and drive industry-leading results. We have been pleased with our ability to capitalize on our strong competitive positioning and generate robust sales momentum and will continue to judiciously manage our capital and operating investments to drive long-term growth and high returns. Our entire team remains highly committed to our business and our customers, and we are very confident in our ability to build on the strong historical EPS results I outlined at the beginning of our call today. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work, dedication and performance in 2023. Now I will turn the call over to Brent."", 'Brent G. Kirby', ""Thanks, Brad. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another great year in 2023 and welcoming our newest Canadian team members to our great company. We're thrilled to partner with the Vast-Auto team to enter the Canadian market. Their experienced leadership team and excellent company culture, provide a strong foundation for our growth in Canada, and we view this acquisition as an important part of our strategic expansion plans. Today, I will further discuss our fourth quarter and full year operational results and provide some additional color on our outlook for 2024. Starting with gross margin. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 51.3% was a 47 basis point increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 and at the high end of our expectations. Our full year gross margin also came in at 51.3%, in line with last year and also at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, our full year results as compared to 2022 were impacted by incremental pressure we faced in the first quarter from the final impacts of calendaring our 2022 professional pricing initiative. Subsequent to the first quarter, our gross margin for the remaining 3 quarters of the year improved approximately 30 basis points from the comparable period in 2022. We've been pleased with our consistent solid gross margin results, especially in light of the mix headwind we faced from our outsized strong performance in our professional business. Our supply chain teams with outstanding support from our supplier partners have worked diligently to drive improved gross margins through incremental improvements in acquisition costs and distribution efficiencies. For 2024, we expect to continue to see further expansion of gross margin as we calendar our gains in 2023 and drive similar incremental improvements as we progress through the year. We have established a guidance range for 2024 of 51% to 51.5%, which includes an anticipated 25 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of the acquired Vast-Auto business in our results. As we outlined in our press release, because of our new partner's current mix of lower margin distribution business to independent parts stores, we're expecting this headwind to consolidate gross margin, but only expect a net impact of 15 basis points to operating profit since they operate with a lower mix of owned stores and associated operating cost. Excluding the impact of adding the Vast-Auto business, our expected gross profit is projected to be up 24 basis points at the midpoint. This reflects our confidence in the tremendous amount of focus our supply chain, store operations and sales teams have on creating a premium value proposition for our customers. Our quarterly gross margin remained very consistent throughout 2023. and we expect a similar quarterly cadence as we move through 2024. While we cannot completely predict what inflation will look like from a macro perspective, our current assumptions also build in a stable inflation environment, both as it relates to our product input cost and selling prices to our customers, as Brad outlined in his comments. During 2023, we saw puts and takes in the costing environment as a result of inflationary pressures broadly experienced by our supply chain partners, offset by our Team's efforts to manage acquisition cost effectively. We really view this as a normal state of condition for our industry and expect a similar rational environment in 2024. Our expectations also assume customer pricing in our industry will remain rational. As pleased as we've been with our incremental improvements to gross margin rate, we're even more excited with our strong gross profit dollar growth, which saw an increase of 10% in 2023 and is projected for solid growth again in 2024. Our consistent strong performance is the direct result of a continued high level of execution of our business model and our unrelenting commitment to providing our customers with the absolute best parts availability in our industry. This competitive advantage is the direct result of our long-term commitment to making sound investments in our supply chain, distribution network and inventory position. And we're excited about the projects we have underway to continue to enhance our capabilities in 2024. To start on the distribution side of the business, we have 3 significant projects in development that will add capacity and service levels to our network, and I'd like to provide a quick update on our progress. As we have previously disclosed, we currently have new distribution centers under construction to relocate our existing Springfield, Missouri and Atlanta, Georgia DCs to larger, more efficient facilities. This expanded capacity will enable us to continue to support new store growth in some of our more mature core market areas as well as support the increased per store volumes that have grown significantly during the last several years. Both of these projects are on track. We're projecting the Springfield relocation to be complete in the back half of 2024, and we'll begin the process of transferring stores to the new Atlanta facility at the end of this year. We're also making great progress on the development of our new greenfield distribution center in Stafford, Virginia and continue to expect for this facility to be operational in the middle of 2025. It will support our expansion into these new untapped market areas for our company. Our distribution strategy directly aligns with the store growth strategies that Brad outlined earlier, and these new facilities will be key drivers of our ability to capture market share in both existing and new markets. In addition to the investments we're making in our distribution centers, we continue to prioritize the opportunities we have to enhance our hub store network, which is the next level of our tiered supply chain model. Our ability to support our stores with quick access to broad localized SKU availability is an important factor in our ability to effectively compete up and down the street. We continually evaluate this network to ensure all of our stores have the best access to inventory in their respective markets, and we'll adjust the number, location and size of hub stores as necessary to achieve this goal. Every year, a portion of our capital and operating investment is geared toward this tier in our distribution model and our plans for 2024 are in line with this continued commitment. Moving on to inventory. Our inventory per store at the end of 2023 was $575,000, which was up 4% from the end of last year, driven by our continued opportunistic investments to support our sales momentum. In the coming year, our planned growth and inventory per store corresponds with the growth we will send -- see in our distribution and hub network. For 2024, we expect per-store inventory to increase approximately 4% within our existing chain with the addition of the acquired Vast-Auto inventory, resulting in another 1% of per store growth since their model is more heavily weighted to distribution with a lower store count. Our growth objectives are focused on adding expanded inventories in our relocated DCs, augmenting the inventory availability in our hub network and capitalizing on targeted additions in our stores to ensure we're offering the best possible local assortment and inventory availability. Now I want to spend some time covering our SG&A and operating profit performance in 2023 and our outlook for 2024. Fourth quarter SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 32.6%, up 43 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022 and above our expectations due to higher-than-expected self-insured auto liability exposure and legal costs, driven by inflation and claims costs. Average per store SG&A expense for the full year of 2023 were up 7.8%, slightly above our revised guidance from the third quarter as a result of these same drivers. As we have discussed throughout the year, the outsized year-over-year SG&A growth as compared to our historical growth rates, was the result of planned initiatives targeted at enhancing our long-term operational strength through reinvestment in our stores, technology and our outstanding team. As we look forward to 2024, we're planning to grow average SG&A per store by 4.5% to 5%. With approximately 1/2 of 1 point of this increase driven by the addition of the Vast-Auto operations. Our anticipated store growth in 2024 is a step down from the significant investment we made in 2023, but is higher than we would normally forecast in our initial SG&A guidance driven by a few key factors. Part of our anticipated increase in 2024 SG&A expense is driven by a year-over-year increase in depreciation expense directly related to our increased CapEx spend in both 2023 and 2024. As we calendar passed our prior year investments, this headwind will moderate as we move through 2024, especially as our mix of capital spending in 2024 shifts more towards new store investments. The more significant driver of our planned initiative-driven SG&A spend is our continued investment in our technology capabilities, both in incremental tools and infrastructure. We've been pleased with the impact our IT investments are having on our business and the opportunities we see to support our growth initiatives as we move forward. Based on these expectations and our projected gross margin rate, we're setting our operating profit guidance range at 19.7% to 20.2%. As we disclosed in our press release yesterday, this includes an anticipated dilution of 15 basis points from the inclusion of Vast-Auto's results in our consolidated guidance. Excluding that impact, our guidance for 2024 brackets our 2023 results with the midpoint of our expected operating profit range down slightly from last year. Based on the anticipated cadence of our SG&A growth during the year, we expect more pressure to operating profit in the first half of the year than the back half. As Brad previously mentioned, we are highly committed to growing our share of the market and driving industry-leading results. Before I close my comments, I want to join Brad in expressing the privilege it was to spend time with our company leaders at our annual leadership conference in January. Our team certainly had much to celebrate given their outstanding performance in 2023, but it was evident that our team is not satisfied with resting on our past success. Rather, they are intensely focused on providing excellent customer service and continuing to grow market share in 2024 and beyond. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy."", 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""Thanks, Brent. I would also like to congratulate Team O'Reilly on another outstanding year. Now we will fill in some additional details on our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2024. For the fourth quarter, sales increased $188 million, driven by a 3.4% increase in comparable store sales and a $71 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2024, we expect our total revenues to be between $16.8 billion and $17.1 billion. Our guidance for total revenues includes the benefit from leap day in 2024, but this additional day will not be included in our comparable store sales calculation consistent with our historical practice. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 17.7% of pretax income comprised of a base rate of 18.9%, reduced by a 1.2% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2022 rate of 18.2% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 19.9%, reduced by a 1.7% benefit from share-based compensation. The fourth quarter of 2023 base rate as compared to 2022 was lower as a result of an increase in certain federal and state tax credits. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 21.9% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.1% reduced by a 1.2% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2024, we expect an effective tax rate of 22.6%, comprised of a base rate of 23.1%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods, also variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate. Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results in 2023 and our expectations for 2024. Free cash flow for 2023 was $2 billion versus $2.4 billion in 2022. The decrease of $383 million was the result of the increased capital expenditures Brad discussed earlier as well as an increase in net inventory in 2023 versus the substantial working capital reduction in net inventory we realized in 2022. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in income and a benefit from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to again be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. We anticipate the benefit to free cash flow from growth in our operating income will be offset by a headwind as we compare to the benefit we realized in 2023 from favorable timing of tax payments and purchases of renewable energy tax credits. As Brad and Brent discussed in their prepared comments, in 2024, we have planned for capital expenditures and inventory growth at similar levels to the investments we made in 2023. And as a result, we expect a comparable impact to free cash flow. I also want to touch briefly on the component of our net inventory driven by our AP to inventory ratio. We finished the fourth quarter at 131%, which was reduced from the rate we saw through much of 2023. This moderation in AP reflects the timing impact of payments associated with the substantial inventory purchases we made at the end of 2022 to support our strong sales volumes and significant inventory additions as we exited last year. For 2024, we expect to see continued moderation and an impact from our Canadian acquisition and currently expect to finish the year at a ratio of approximately 127%. Moving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.03x as compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by our successful issuance of $750 million of 3-year senior notes in November and borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by the June retirement of $300 million of maturing notes. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And for 2023, we repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average share price of $883.13 for a total investment of $3.2 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2011, we have repurchased 94 million shares at an average share price of $247 for a total investment of $23.3 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance, Brad outlined earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their dedication to our company and our customers. Your hard work and commitment to excellent customer service continues to drive our outstanding performance. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities.', 'Joshua Allen Young', ""This is Joshua Young on for Scot. As we look to 2024, how are you thinking about the sustainability of the growth rates you've been putting up on the commercial side of the business? Then as we think about the transaction growth in commercial, would you attribute it more to doing business with new customers? Or is that coming more from wallet share with existing accounts?"", 'Brad W. Beckham', ""Josh, it's Brad. I'll kick this off and see if the guys have anything else. But as I think you know, there's a lot of moving pieces this year. We're going up against a huge performance last year in 2023 on top of everything we generated with mid-teens, comp sales growth on the professional side in the last 3 years. So I want to be a little bit careful talking about the sustainability of that as a percentage as our bases continue to get bigger. Again, there's a lot of moving pieces in 2024. We want to be a little bit cautious of everything going on in '24. But what I can talk to you about from an absolute confidence perspective is our ability to continue to outcomp the market and continue to take share, especially on the professional side of the business. We couldn't be more confident in our team's ability to continue to drive share gains on the professional side. As you know that side of the business is still extremely fragmented. And we have a lot of initiatives in place as well as just our fundamental everyday execution that we've always had to make sure we continue to drive share gains here in 2024. In terms of the transaction part of it, Josh, I would say it's probably a combination of both. When we think about the makeup of our professional business and you think of kind of how we're always working up that call list, we're always going to be focused on new business. There's customers out there even in existing markets that still don't buy hardly anything from us simply because of the relationship they have with somebody else. And that business and those relationships is built over time, but we're out there chipping away on it every day. And so we have that business that we're not doing today. And when Brent and I and Jeremy look at our performance on the professional side, we're seeing fairly balanced growth, both with existing customers and new. And we feel like that is going to continue for the foreseeable future."", 'Joshua Allen Young', ""Got it. Very helpful. And then, just this year, you obviously had the elevated SG&A growth on that investment spending. And it sounds like that may be the case again in '24. Could you just give us some more color on where your biggest remaining investment opportunities are? And do you think you'll be finished with this sort of accelerated investment cycle by the end of this year?"", 'Brad W. Beckham', ""Yes, I'll take that, Josh. And again, see if the guys have anything else. Obviously, a very fair question. As you know, as we talk through the quarters in 2023, we continue to see opportunities to play from our position of strength. We're always thinking about the long game when it comes to making sure that we're driving the profitability of our business through sustained share gains that we talked about a minute ago. Really, as we said a couple of times last year, we had the question, is this going to continue in 2024? And our answers then the entire time that we're going to wait and see and see how we feel about the continued ability for us to capitalize on some of the volatility that's happening with some weaker competitors. And as you've seen, that's still how we feel. Really, when we look at the makeup of that, we're obviously rifle approach when it comes to our store payroll and how we manage that each and every day. We're also still rifle approach on making sure those staffing levels to really affect both sides of our business on the share gains. We want to make sure that we continue to staff for that. Really, the makeup that Brent just talked about really how we're seeing that is the biggest driver of that is going to be our continued investments in tech. And how we're thinking about that is pretty simple. We have had an amazing run in the last many years, but we're not looking backwards. We're looking at the next many years of our business. We only own 10% of the market in the U.S. And so we have an extreme opportunity to get after some of these investments when it comes to technology and specifically in the form of how are we going to help our frontline team members to give better customer service. How are we going to remove friction from the customer experience, both with our DIY customers and our professional customers. And so we feel extremely good about those investments in SG&A, and we feel like there's things we could do, Josh, here for the short term to drive down SG&A, but that wouldn't be the right thing to do, knowing we only own 10% of the market and knowing that we're playing the long game here."", 'Brent G. Kirby', ""Yes. And the only thing I would add Josh, to Brad's comments, especially as it relates to the tech investments, everything we invest in, to Brad's point, we're playing the long game, but we invest through a filter of expecting a return on it. And a return in the marketplace and an outsized return with our customer base. So that's the lens we look through when we make those investments."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.', 'Katharine Amanda McShane', 'I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the change to more owned retail? And can you walk us through what that means for availability of cash for share buybacks over the longer term?', 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""Kate, this is Jeremy. Great question. It's been kind of an interesting transition over a lot of our history as a company. We've always had a preference or a bias towards owned properties. We feel like that long-term investment and our ability to get compounding returns out of an increasing store bases is an attractive part of how we're able to deploy capital for our shareholders. invest back in our business. And we've spoken kind of, gosh, over the long course of time, especially as we move to sort of our current capital structure in 2011 and started to dial up our share buyback, we've been consistent around how we think about the prioritization of our use of capital. And the first part of that has always been within our existing operations and how we think about funding the things that are going to make our existing stores be better. And then as we focus on growth, we know that, that's been a very valuable engine for a long course of time for our shareholders. That's always been tempered a little bit by what are the best opportunities and things that are available within our market. And so we've always had a balance. As we work through the last few years, we've seen the economics on those investments improve really on both sides. But for sure, as we own those properties and the per store volumes and our profitability per store have improved, there's an even I think, more powerful value creation mechanism there as we invest in owned stores, and I think that's helped. I think there's also been an ability to identify those properties within the marketplace that has been a little bit easier. So those have been the driving factors, and it's obviously been moving that direction for at least some period of time.You don't make those decisions for the next year at the beginning of the year, they've been in play. But for us, for this year, we would expect instead of being around 40% of owned new stores in our mix to be closer to 60% for the year and feel like that that's a positive thing. In terms of how it affects our ability to deploy cash from a share buyback perspective, obviously, at the increments, it's going to be less dollars that we would allocate to that. But that's -- that's also in line with our historical priorities around use of capital."", 'Brad W. Beckham', ""Yes. And Kate, I may just jump in. This is Brad. Jeremy did a great job kind of really framing up your -- the answer to your question. The one thing I would highlight and just reiterate from what Jeremy said was how incredibly impressed we are with our ability to open new stores. Our team is just doing from site acquisition all the way through the build all the way through the store execution and our field Team's ability to build the right team with a great store manager professional parts people, we are just incredibly pleased with our new store performance both in backfill markets in kind of the center part of the country and our existing footprint as well as our new greenfield markets."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson.', 'Michael Allen Baker', ""Can you -- you sort of alluded to it, but a little more color on the competitive situation. You guys have been pretty big market share gainers if you just look at your comps versus competitors or even your comps versus I don't know if you look at the NAICS data, sales through automotive supply entire stores. With your comps a little bit lower this quarter because of tough comparisons, you are a little bit below that industry data. I'm wondering if there's anything changing in your view in terms of competitive situation or market's ability to take market share or anything along those lines?"", 'Brad W. Beckham', ""Mike, it's Brad. I'll take a stab at that. So maybe just to answer your question directly on the NAICS data. We, in our business, at least at O'Reilly, have never been able to tie that out exactly to correlate the way that some do. Not to say directionally, there's not something there. But we haven't seen anything change in the competitive dynamic as we look at our performance in Q4 by month. I -- Mike, I spent a lot of time just looking at the outputs from our CRM tool that our sales team has out in the field. And listen, those independent competitors that you know very well, I mean, they're incredibly well run. We have a tremendous amount of respect for those WDs, the independents, the 2 steppers. They do an incredible job. And they are honestly our toughest competitor and they hold the most market share when we look at the total addressable market on the professional side of our business, that they are great competitors. That said, there's been nothing that we see that has pointed to anything that has been a step change or anything different, but they were tough all year last year, and they continue to be tough in Q4. And so I wouldn't tie that directly to what you're seeing in that data, we just really aren't seeing that."", 'Brent G. Kirby', 'Mike, this is Brent. I would add to everything Brad said. I would also add that we continue to see a very rational pricing environment out there amongst the competition and as it relates to our ability to continue to win when it comes down to professional parts people and parts availability and service, we feel very good with our proposition going forward.', 'Michael Allen Baker', ""Okay. That makes sense. One -- another follow-up to something you said. You talked about the operating profit pressure to be a little bit greater in the first half, but gross margin is relatively consistent and comps relatively consistent. So presumably, the SG&A is a little bit higher in the first half. Is that just timing of when you're adding some investments or more store labor in the first half of the year versus second half? Just curious what would cause that to occur?"", 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""No, Mike. It's really a little bit more of the impact of the investments we made throughout 2023, and especially as those -- some of those capital investments, thinking about things like the rollout of our store fleet or our ability to get all the way through all of our stores with our LED lighting upgrade, the timing of how those investments flowed in, in the prior year and the depreciation impact of that means that we've got some compare noise that would hit us a little bit heavier in the first part of our year. There is also some degree of timing of some of the technology investments that Brent spoke to, that is the cadence of what that looks like. So that's the reason for that, I guess, commentary around how we would expect cadence to look."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS.', 'Michael Lasser', 'As you set your guidance for 3% to 5% comp growth for the year, what have you assumed about the industry growth rate and your ability to take share within the industry? Have you assumed that essentially you will grow your share at the same rate that you did in 2023?', 'Brad W. Beckham', 'Michael, great question. We appreciate it. So kind of -- obviously, we want to balance our confidence in our ability to continue to take share, to continue to outcomp the market in all both sides of the business, not just professional. As I said earlier, I think maybe Brent and I both did, we see 2024 generally as an overall market as more of a ""normal"" year. Now what\'s the definition of normal. You look back at the last many years and how much volatility, how much opportunity, how many things have happened, kind of previous to COVID, we generally think that a normal year based upon all our history, all our decades of doing this, that a normal year for the industry is probably more in that 2% to 3% range.And so I think that ties into kind of what we\'re saying with our guide. Again, like you know, Michael, we always say we\'re not very good at predicting the future, and it\'s hard to say exactly what the what future holds for the industry in 2024. But I think I would generally point you to that kind of 2% to 3% range.', 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""Michael, the only thing I would add to that is, if you have to ask the question, do we think our market share gains will be as strong in 2024 as they were in 2023? The answer obviously is no. I mean, we comped to 7.9% last year, and we're clearly not guiding to that range this year. We feel like that we still have the same competitive advantages. We really feel like our Teams are energized and enthusiastic about the momentum we've created to move forward. But we're continuing to calendar increasingly hard comps, especially on the professional traffic side of our business. So that, I think, implicit within how we think about the way this year will play out. It's just our knowledge that we're going to continue to make gains, but we're doing that on a bigger base."", 'Michael Lasser', ""Okay. My follow-up question is, Brad, as you begin the tenure of being the CEO of O'Reilly, do you think that the company is at a peak operating margin rate level? And how much within your focus is on continuing to improve the percentage rate of this organization over time, given that there has been a lot of investment spend made over the last few years?"", 'Brad W. Beckham', ""Yes. Thank you so much, Michael. So as you know, our primary focus, I've been here for 27 years, grew up with the company and our -- everything that we do has always started as a company with our mission statement that we're going to be the dominant auto parts supplier in all our market areas. And we always focus on not just the business we have but what's out there in the market, total addressable not only for the U.S. but now Mexico and Canada. And so every -- we start with that. And then we always have done that profitably, and our goal has always been to drive operating profit dollar growth. And that has not changed. When I think back, Michael, over the last 5 years, I absolutely don't want to live in the past. But when you think about the fact that we ended 2019 with an operating profit percentage of 18.9%, ended the year with a 20.3% at 2023, I think that kind of to your question, kind of points to where we're thinking about the future in terms of what I want to make sure we do and what we want to make sure we do is we want to set up for a similar trajectory going forward in the years to come. not meaning that we're assuring anybody of what our rate is going to be, but we know we can do it through share gains and driving operating profit dollar growth.That's where our head is at. It's where it's always been at. Now do we have pride in where we've gotten our rate? Absolutely, especially since going all the way back to when we bought CSK in 2008. We're extremely prideful of where we've gotten our rate. And question has always been, hey, what is the right operating profit percentage? And our answer has always been as high as we can possibly get. So we're going to continue to have that focus. We're going to focus on share gains, doing it profitably and driving that operating profit dollar growth, and we'll continue to make sure that we drive that rate as much as we possibly can."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.', 'Simeon Ari Gutman', ""Brad, we were talking about SG&A earlier. And last year, you spent a little more, and you did get a return. I know it's not perfectly linked, but it looks like you got to pay off last year. How much debate did you have around maintaining an even higher level of spend? I know there's some tapering, but why not continue to lean in, while there's, call it, displacement going on in the industry behind you?"", 'Brad W. Beckham', 'Thanks, Simeon, and I\'ll start that off and see if the guys have anything else. So yes, I think that\'s right. We feel really good. There\'s been a lot of talk about kind of -- we\'ve been asked about catch-up with what we spent this last year. And I think we want to more reframe that to timing because anything that we were ""catching up"" on, to Brent\'s point earlier to one of the other questions, we have a very solid discipline internally here on a return on every amount of spend that we make, whether it be SG&A, whether it be CapEx and how those play together between CapEx and OpEx with depreciation. And so we feel really good about the money we spend. We feel really good about the returns. And we\'re going to continue to lean into that, both directions. And we -- that\'s really what got us to where we\'re at today to kind of your -- the root of your question is where is that line of what\'s the right spend and that really just lanes us back to our guidance. We feel really good about every moving piece of our SG&A. We feel good about the returns as well as CapEx and everything that we\'re talking about when it comes to tech investments, when it comes to safer vehicles, the image and appearance of our stores and all the things you\'ve heard us talk about. We\'re going to continue to lean into that as you\'ve seen.', 'Brent G. Kirby', 'Simeon, I...', 'Simeon Ari Gutman', 'And a follow-up -- please.', 'Brent G. Kirby', ""Simeon, just one other thing to maybe add to Brad's comment and kind of speak to your question, too, is, obviously, we just leaned into an acquisition, too, as part of investing in a future opportunity. And we feel good about that investment as well, still more shape to come to that over time, but definitely continue to lean in where we see opportunity."", 'Simeon Ari Gutman', ""Yes. And a quick follow-up, more short term. I don't think I heard it in the prepared remarks, maybe you never venture to guess what weather means in a quarter. Given that you face 2 years of favorable weather, but any idea and is there deferred maintenance or that got resolved with the ongoing run rate of the business?"", 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""You're talking about fourth quarter, Simeon?"", 'Simeon Ari Gutman', 'Yes, any fourth quarter impact? And then does that create deferred maintenance? Or has that just gotten realized as the weather has become more favorable for maintenance and repair?', 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""Yes. No, I appreciate the question. A good one. For sure, there is a fourth quarter impact. I would tell you that for both the weather impact, the calendar, the timing of the holiday was a little bit unfavorable to us. The bulk of what we saw was anticipated and would have been built into how we thought about the guidance as we moved into the fourth quarter. It had a lot to do with how we performed in 2022, which was very strong, in '21 also. So there's definitely a degree to which the timing of winter showing up in January versus December impacted those results. In terms of how you think about that for major shifts to deferral, we're not talking about like a huge needle mover and it's really I mean, literally as simple as a couple of weeks in December last year versus a couple of weeks in January of this year. And that's why within the prepared comments, we talked about kind of on balance as we think about the full winter season, we're sort of where we would expect to be in the setup for the remainder of the year is how we would view as kind of normal for our industry."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore.', 'Gregory Scott Melich', ""I'd like to follow up on sales and then maybe a bit on SG&A. Just to make clear, I've got the fourth quarter, right, It was December, I think you said pressured. Was it actually negative in December. And is the first quarter running above the range for the year, given the polar vortex?"", 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""Yes. So I can answer both those questions, Greg. The December was negative for us. It was better than our plan candidly, but we kind of knew it would be -- it was substantially good last year. We don't give discrete quantification of where we run at the beginning of the year just because there's always a challenge with short periods of time and how the weeks to weeks can vary just on a 1-year comp. But we do feel comfortable that we're running well. We're pleased with how we set up and we largely attribute that shrink so far to the couple of weeks of really, really harsh weather that we got in January."", 'Gregory Scott Melich', 'Got it. And then maybe a follow-up on sales. I want to make sure I get the inflation and mix part of this, right? So inflation same SKU will be around 1%. And then should we assume another 200 bps of complexity and mix within your 3% to 5% guide? Is that a fair buildup?', 'Jeremy Adam Fletcher', ""Yes. I don't know that I'd put too finer point like that on it, Greg, for 2024. First, I don't know what inflation will be in 2024. Our guidance is a little bit less than 1%. We'll get a benefit from the average ticket above that, even independent of professional growing faster, which naturally pulls the total company average ticket up. But we would still expect that a portion of our comp expectations for next year are driven by ticket count growth as the professional side of the business is expected to continue to be solid."", 'Gregory Scott Melich', ""Great. Well, I'll let somebody ask -- someone else ask when do you get the flex capacitor in stock that we see on the website."", 'Brad W. Beckham', 'Thank you, Greg.', 'Operator', 'We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Brad Beckham for closing remarks.', 'Brad W. Beckham', ""Thank you, Matthew.

In anticipation of the announcement, industry analysts and investors are eager to assess the company's performance and prospects in the current economic climate.In the last reported quarter, this retail REIT reported a surprise of 1.85% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected healthy leasing activity and occupancy levels at its properties.Over the last four quarters, Federal Realty surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average beat being 1.71%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:"", 'Federal Realty Investment Trust price-eps-surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust Quote', ""In this article, we will dive deep into the U.S. retail real estate market environment and the company's fundamentals and analyze the factors that may have contributed to its fourth-quarter 2023 performance."", 'Per a report from CBRE Group CBRE, the U.S. overall retail availability rate hit a record-low 4.7% at year-end, down 10 basis points (bps) quarter over quarter and 31 bps year over year. Among the categories, the neighborhood, community & strip center segment tightened the most. This property type continues to experience positive net absorption, with the fourth quarter net absorption of 12.5 million square feet, bringing the 2023 annual total to 40 million square feet.There is a dearth of supply, and elevated construction costs and interest rates are likely to continue to keep new supply in check. Fourth-quarter and full-year construction completions of 5.3 million and 27 million square feet, respectively, marked record lows. The average asking rent was up by 0.8% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the year to $23.76 per square foot, and both the growth rates were higher than their 10-year averages, per the CBRE report.', ""Federal Realty is expected to have gained from the recovery in the retail real estate sector. The company possesses a collection of high-quality retail properties, primarily positioned in major coastal markets spanning from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. FRT’s properties are strategically located in the first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan markets of the United States, aiding its fourth-quarter cash flows.Due to strong demographics and the prime location of its properties, the company has consistently upheld a high occupancy rate over the years. FRT's diverse mix of retail tenants is anticipated to have contributed to stable rental income during the fourth quarter. Our estimation places FRT's leasing rate at 94.2%, while the rent per square foot is projected to grow 3% year over year. Furthermore, Federal Realty's strong financial position is likely to have facilitated its development endeavors in the fourth quarter.FRT's strategic focus on mixed-use properties enables the company to benefit from multiple revenue streams. By combining residential, retail and office spaces, these properties attract a variety of tenants, creating a vibrant, bustling atmosphere that draws in consumers. This diversification is likely to have played a crucial role in FRT's fourth-quarter 2023 performance as it insulates the company from the fluctuations and uncertainties of a single sector.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $293.29 million, calling for a 4.73% increase from the year-ago period. The consensus mark for rental revenues is pegged at $292.85 million, suggesting a rise from the year-ago period’s $279.78 million.Rental income from minimum rents — commercial — is presently pegged at $190.28 million, up from $180.75 in the year-ago period. Rental income from cost reimbursements is projected at $56.30 million, up from $53.40 million in the prior-year period.However, a high interest rate environment is a concern for Federal Realty. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, and our estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 19.4% in the company's fourth-quarter 2023 interest expenses.Federal Realty’s activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share has been unrevised at $1.64 over the past month. However, it suggests a 3.80% increase year over year.For 2023, Federal Realty projects FFO per share in the range of $6.50-$6.58.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is pegged at $6.56. The figure indicates a 3.80% increase year over year on 5.54% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.13 billion."", 'Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Federal Realty this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Federal Realty currently has a Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

Few garnered nearly as much attention as Ozempic, a therapy marketed by Denmark-based biotech giant Novo Nordisk. Ozempic addresses a real problem. Diabetes and obesity have been on the rise for decades, cause severe strain on healthcare systems, and are projected to worsen.', ""However, Ozempic comes with potential drawbacks, one of which is muscle loss. Several companies are looking to address that problem, including Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN). Let's find out what these two healthcare leaders are doing and whether it makes their shares worth buying."", ""Regeneron's management recently discussed the muscle-loss problem that therapies like Ozempic bring with them. According to the company, it has been shown that as much as 40% of the weight-loss that patients experience while on Ozempic is due to a decrease in lean muscle mass."", 'George Yancopoulos, Regeneron\'s chief scientific officer, did not mince words: ""This potentially irretrievable muscle loss can be catastrophic for patients and may even lead to major public health concerns in the future.""', 'The consequences of excessive muscle loss can range from having difficulty moving around to lower energy levels, a weakened immune system, etc. And as therapies like Ozempic continue to gain steam -- predictions say their sales will skyrocket through the end of the decade -- the issue could become substantially more serious, as Yancopoulos implied.', 'What do Abbott and Regeneron plan to do about the problem?', 'Abbott recently launched a new brand called Protality that will market products tailor-made to help people on their weight-loss journey. The first product on the list will be a low-calorie protein shake. Protein is often said to be the building block of muscles; consuming enough protein is essential to maintaining muscle mass. Abbott will launch other products as well within its new Protality brand.', 'Regeneron is taking a different approach. The biotech plans to start phase 2 clinical trials investigating whether several combination treatments involving two of its clinical compounds, trevogrumab and garetosmab, along with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic) will lead to a better quality of weight loss -- that is, will help control muscle loss.', 'There is another problem Regeneron is also looking to address. Once patients have lost weight, many are likely to regain it after they stop treatment. The drugmaker hopes that its combo treatment can help patients keep their weight down.', ""Should investors purchase shares of Abbott and Regeneron for their work in this area? The answer is a resounding no. Abbott's Protality brand will likely account for just a small percentage of its total revenue, at least for now. And while Regeneron's work could lead to blockbuster products, the company still has a long way to go before it launches them."", 'Fortunately, there are much better reasons to invest in both companies. Both have delivered consistent revenue and earnings growth over the past decade.', 'These health care stalwarts also have important growth drivers. Abbott is a leader in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system thanks to its FreeStyle Libre franchise. It still has a massive worldwide market to address; Abbott estimates that of the more than half a billion diabetic adults in the world, only 1% use CGM technology. Abbott is one of the two leaders in this field, one that it could continue to dominate for many years.', ""The medical device specialist's vast portfolio and strong innovative capabilities should allow it to develop newer and better products, just as in the past. And, of course, Abbott has raised its payouts for 52 straight years, making it a top pick for dividend investors. Regeneron will continue to rely on its two biggest cash cows, eczema treatment Dupixent and Eylea, a therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration, for a while."", 'However, the biotech is working on other products that should hit the market well before its combination therapy, looking to address excessive muscle loss. Regeneron currently boasts 12 products in phase 3 studies that will lead to brand-new approvals. Case in point: The biotech expects to launch two new cancer treatments this year, odronextamab and linvoseltamab, provided they pass the final regulatory test.', ""Regeneron could make a splash in the weight-loss market in the future. It's important to keep an eye on that effort. But for now, the biotech's prospects remain strong even without it. The same applies to Abbott Laboratories. That's why both stocks are worth buying."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Abbott Laboratories right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Abbott Laboratories, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Abbott Laboratories wasn’t one of them.
