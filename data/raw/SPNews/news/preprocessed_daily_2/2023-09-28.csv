The stock has gained 17.1%, significantly outperforming the 6.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Aiding APTVAptiv has put on an impressive performance, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings and revenues in the trailing four quarters.The company is exposed to the lucrative connected cars market. With security becoming a key selling point for connected cars, automakers are increasingly seeking related technologies. This is one of the reasons behind the quick advancement of the driver-assistance system market. Demand for personalization, infotainment connectivity and convenience are increasing rapidly. Added features require more wiring inside vehicles.Aptiv PLC Price Aptiv PLC PriceAptiv PLC price | Aptiv PLC QuoteWe believe that with excellent system integration expertise, Aptiv is well-positioned to leverage the growing electrification, connectivity and autonomy trends in the automotive sector.The company’s ""smart architecture"" provides a competitive advantage and should help it continue gaining market share. Decreasing environmental impact and increasing fuel economy are the key industry trends. OEMs have increased their search for better engine management and lower power consumption. Aptiv intends to take advantage of this trend as its “smart architecture” reduces wiring requirements in cars, helping them become fuel-efficient and add features.The 2022 acquisition of Wind River expanded Aptiv’s position in the automotive software solutions market. Another 2022 acquisition, Intercable Automotive Solutions, strengthened APTV’s position as a global leader in vehicle architecture systems. Aptiv intends to continue making investments for organic and inorganic growth. Since it acquires a large number of companies on an ongoing basis, the integration of these companies generates cost synergies, which improve the efficiency of the combined company.Story continuesFavorable Estimate RevisionsThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.

(NASDAQ:VRSK) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics Is Verisk Analytics Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Story continuesGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$974.2mUS$1.09bUS$1.17bUS$1.24bUS$1.30bUS$1.36bUS$1.41bUS$1.45bUS$1.49bUS$1.53bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 7.77%Est @ 6.08%Est @ 4.90%Est @ 4.08%Est @ 3.50%Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.81%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$913US$955US$965US$959US$942US$919US$891US$861US$829US$797(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.0bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.2%) = US$34bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$34b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$18bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$27b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$242, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Verisk Analytics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.916. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Verisk AnalyticsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

Fixed income has been in the spotlight for investors in a higher interest rate environment. We have seized the opportunity to expand our fixed income offerings, recently launching high yield and municipal bond ETFs, while also helping investors save on fees.”Since investors consider the expense ratio as one of the most important factors before owning an ETF, such low fees are expected to attract more clients for SCHW.Thus, despite the lower price on each ETF product, Schwab will likely be able to remain profitable in terms of its ETF business with the increase in volume.Amid the uncertain market conditions, Schwab has remained focused on enhancing its trading revenues by undertaking several initiatives aimed at building client base. The company has already lowered its basic online equity and ETF trade commissions to zero.Also, it launched Schwab Stock Slices, through which investors are able to own shares of any company in the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at $5 each, even though these shares cost more.Over the past year, shares of SCHW have lost 22.7% against the industry’s rise of 1.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Schwab carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks from the same space are Morgan Stanley MS and Interactive Brokers IBKR.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Texas Instruments:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.30 = US$8.6b ÷ (US$31b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 30%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Texas Instruments compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Texas Instruments here  for free.What Can We Tell From Texas Instruments' ROCE Trend?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Texas Instruments, we didn't gain much confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 39%, but they have dropped over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOur Take On Texas Instruments' ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Texas Instruments' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has gained an impressive 67% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with Texas Instruments (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

11,adce26f9-3eee-38e6-b6cb-e29b85269c3e,TXN,2023-09-28,4 Stocks With Recent Dividend Hikes Amid a Choppy Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-recent-dividend-hikes-141900016.html,1695737940,STORY,"['PNM', 'KDP', 'TXN', 'MSFT']","[Wall Street had a solid bull run in the first seven months of the year. However, markets have stayed volatile since August. The Fed, which has been aggressively increasing interest rates since March 2022 to curb sky-high inflation, in between, paused hikes twice — June and September — but concerns of an economic slowdown have escalated lately.In fact, all three major indexes ended in the red last week despite the Federal Reserve keeping its policy interest rate unchanged.This is because the post-FOMC statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampened investors’ spirits as he maintained a hawkish stance and said that the fight against inflation is far from over and that at least another quarter percentage interest rate hike would be required this year.The present benchmark lending rate at present is in the range of 5.25%-5.5%. Another 25-basis point hike in November will take the terminal interest rate of this current monetary tightening campaign to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Moreover, the central bank also lowered its interest rate cut forecast to two in 2024 from four projected in June. Also, the first interest rate cut won’t come before September.These have raised concerns that inflationary pressures will prove to be stubborn and the economy might slip into a recession. Markets are thus likely to remain volatile for a longer period than expected earlier.Stocks in FocusGiven this situation, dividend-yielding stocks should be an ideal choice for investors aiming to secure their portfolios. We recommend considering stocks that have recently raised their dividend payouts.Four such stocks are Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP, PNM Resources, Inc.

The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 4.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.43 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -31.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -36.4%. This estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12 indicates a change of -34.4% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -18%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.59 billion and $31.31 billion estimates indicate -16.7% and -9.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $9.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.3%. EPS of $5.81 for the same period compares with $9.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.16%. The EPS surprise was +3.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The power of AI/ML is derived from high-quality experimental data generated by scientists in the laboratory. Discovering and harnessing novel biology is the key to unlocking safe and effective new medicines, and AI is a remarkable tool in this pursuit. Importantly, the complexity and volume of laboratory-generated data needed to train AI/ML models requires highly integrated research and development infrastructure, resulting in more specialized technical laboratory space requirements.(PRNewsfoto/Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.)""Using advanced imaging systems, we generate more than a petabyte of data each week that would simply be impossible to interpret without the proprietary AI and machine learning tools developed in our laboratories,"" said Roger M.

Also, the company is on track with its PVH+ Plan.Driven by these factors, the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in second-quarter fiscal 2023. The company witnessed double-digit revenue growth in its direct-to-consumer business in stores and online. This led to year-over-year sales growth of 4% (up 2% on a constant-currency or cc basis).Analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PVH Corp’s fiscal 2023 sales and EPS is pegged at $9.4 billion and $10.3, suggesting respective growth of 3.8% and 15.2% from the year-ago reported figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PVH’s fiscal 2023 earnings has moved up 3.2% in the past 30 days.Let’s Delve DeeperPVH Corp’s Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands continued to perform well in second-quarter fiscal 2023, driven by robust consumer demand. Notably, Tommy Hilfiger’s revenues rose 3% and Calvin Klein’s revenues grew 6% year over year in the quarter.The Tommy Hilfiger brand showcased its most iconic Tommy products, such as the Polo shirt, the Oxford shirt and Chinos, at some of the biggest cultural events, including New York Fashion Week and Formula One Grand Prix. The brand witnessed a 170% increase in sales of the Oxford shirt in the week following its campaign. It also continued to gain momentum in the quarter by being part of the launch of its Mercedes AMG Formula One and Awake collaboration.Meanwhile, the Calvin Klein brand launched a highly successful partnership with Jennie Kim, which was sold globally within days. Other notable partnerships with some of the world's most iconic female athletes ahead of the World Cup acted as tailwinds. Recently, it launched its fall 2023 campaign, highlighting the iconic underwear denim. Going forward, management is confident about the underlying power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, which position the company's business to succeed amid the ever-changing consumer landscape.Its international business has been performing well for quite some time, which continued in the fiscal second quarter. Notably, the international unit’s revenues jumped 6% year over year on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth in the Asia Pacific and Europe regions. Going ahead, management expects international business to drive growth.PVH Corp’s multi-year strategy PVH+ Plan aims at accelerating growth via boosting its core strengths, and connecting Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER brands with consumers through five major drivers. These drivers are — win with product; win with consumer engagement; win in the digitally-led marketplace; develop a demand- and data-driven operating model; and drive efficiencies and invest in growth.  The company expects to strengthen its presence in the global demand spaces, where its iconic labels resonate well with consumers. PVH is focused on fueling digital growth by developing a holistic distribution strategy for Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER, driven by digital and direct-to-consumer channels and wholesale partnerships. Moreover, PVH Corp looks to develop a demand and data-driven operating model with a systematic and repeatable product creation model.PVH focuses on boosting efficiencies to be cost-competitive, and, in turn, reinvesting in strategic plans. In sync with its plans, PVH is on track to reduce 10% of its workforce in its global offices by the end of 2023. The move is likely to generate savings of more than $100 million, which will then be reinvested in digital, supply chain and consumer engagement related to the PVH+ Plan.In a recent development, PVH Corp announced the extension of its license agreements with G-III Apparel Group from 2025 to 2027 as part of the PVH+ plan. The deal will enable the smooth transition of core product categories to PVH at the end of the extended terms. The transaction mainly includes the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands in the United States and Canada, particularly the women’s North American wholesale business.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 8.1% year to date against the industry’s decline of 4.9%.Headwinds to OvercomePVH Corp has been witnessing higher interest rates stemming from the ongoing tough macroeconomic environment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, interest expenses rose 20% year over year to $24 million.For fiscal 2023, interest expenses are likely to be $100 million, suggesting an increase from the prior-year reported figure of $83 million due to higher interest rates. Interest expenses for the fiscal third quarter are likely to be $25 million, whereas the company posted $19 million in the year-ago period.Also, elevated inventory costs and increased investments to support the company’s strategic initiatives dented margins in the quarter. The gross margin contracted 40 bps year over year to 57.6% in second-quarter fiscal 2023. The company’s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $182 million compared with $211 million in the prior-year quarter. Notably, our estimate was pegged at $253.2 million. Consequently, adjusted earnings were $1.98 per share, down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter's $1.94.Wrapping UpAlthough a tough macroeconomic environment is a near-term headwind, we believe that strength in core brands and international unit, and gains from the PVH+ Plan will help the stock sustain its momentum.The PEG ratio for PVH is just 0.55, far lower than the industry average of 1.21. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PVH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. Notably, a VGM Score of A raises optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are MGM Resorts MGM, Royal Caribbean RCL and Crocs CROX.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

He got the job - and never looked back.""Going into banking was an eye-opener for me and, frankly, it was amazing,"" Kight said. ""I had grown up playing sports my whole life, and it was fun to get back into a team environment. It was extremely rewarding.""Kight enjoyed working with business owners during his time as a branch manager, and that led to him moving into commercial banking, serving middle market companies.After taking a break during the financial crisis of 2008 to earn his MBA degree, Kight returned to the industry, eventually joining MUFG Union Bank's commercial banking group in 2016.In that role, Kight began partnering with large healthcare companies, including medical device manufacturers.""It's exciting to work with companies that are really trying to improve people's lives,"" Kight said. ""As a bank, we can help these companies grow in different ways, and that can be very gratifying.""When U.S. Bank acquired MUFG Union Bank in late 2022, Kight was selected to take on his current role. The Healthcare - For Profit division serves a range of clients, including medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare service providers, health information technology and more.Story continues""U.S. Bank is a leader in healthcare banking. It has supported the industry for more than a century - almost as long as it's been a bank - and has best-in-class solutions. Joining this group was a tremendous opportunity,"" Kight said.""When you think about the healthcare cycle, you have insurance companies involved, consumers and, obviously, the providers,"" he said. ""They all have to work together, and all the links in the chain have to connect.""As just one example, Kight said, U.S. Bank has products such as AP Optimizer™, which helps companies manage payments to suppliers, vendors and employees in a way that is most efficient and cost effective for them.Another strength, he said, is the bank's approach to serving clients.""Our relationships are strong and our knowledge is deep,"" Kight said. ""On average, our relationship managers have over 20 years of experience. They are extremely seasoned bankers who understand the nuances of healthcare, including the regulatory issues and how the healthcare ecosystem fits together.""Kight said he enjoyed working for MUFG, but he's happy to work for the company that was once the competition.""U.S. Bank serves its clients extremely well,"" he said. ""No matter what organizations need to operate more efficiently, minimize risk, grow and transform, we can deliver.""U.S. Bank has served healthcare organizations for more than 100 years, delivering innovative solutions to help clients of all types and sizes meet their financing, operational and investment goals so they can focus on their core mission.

To skip our detailed analysis of the banking industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Bank Stocks To Buy For Long-Term.The Banking Sector In 2023The banking industry has had an eventful year so far. With the crash of the Silicon Valley Bank, multiple downgrades from the S&amp;P and Moody's, and generally negative investor sentiment surrounding this industry, it is unsurprising how many investors have been steering clear of banking companies and stocks. However, as we have headed into the second half of 2023, some are beginning to harbor renewed hopes for the sector. There are several reasons for this renewed optimism, the primary ones being a show of resilience by US banks in the face of adversity and the analysis of some experts who believe that higher interest rates may actually be beneficial for some banks.One such expert is Bob Diamond, the CEO of Atlas Merchant Capital and the former CEO of Barclays. Diamond joined CNBC's ""Closing Bell Overtime"" on September 21 to discuss how higher rates may be better for at least the regional banking sector. Here's what he first noted on the status of interest rates in the US:""The bar for reversing the position of the Fed is very, very high. We did feel it was time for a pause and they have and they have paused, but I think one of the things we are seeing in the survey, the summary of economic projections from the Fed presidents and the Fed governors is that when they project out for the funds rate at the end of 2024, it's pretty flat, the word is today. I think even that supports the view that rates are going to stay higher longer.""Can Higher Rates Be Better For Some Banks?On the subject of the banking sector, Diamond went on to discuss how these higher rates can be expected to impact regional banks:""We're very positive on regional banks. We think they're incredibly important to our economy, to the depths of the financial markets in the US. We do expect to see some consolidation there, but I think on balance, they've adjusted pretty well to the higher interest rates of 5%. As you and I both know, if they can level set that and manage to where they are today, higher rates are positive for banks. So five, five and a half percent rates, starting from scratch, are far better for the community of regional banks than zero interest rates.""Story continuesDiamond's analysis on the matter does not mention how investors can expect bigger banks like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) to react to these rates which are expected to stay higher for longer. However, the picture he paints does seem to be less bleak than the one representing the banking sector at the start of this year. In any case, the fact that large banks that have maintained a reliable presence in the US markets and abroad for so long are, at this point, trading lower than usual can actually be an incentive for investors to start pouring their money into the banking sector at this moment. This is because right now, investors have gained the opportunity to buy quality banking stocks at a relative discount to what they would have had to pay in their prime. Considering this, we have compiled a list of some of the best bank stocks to buy right now. Our list also includes some undervalued bank stocks to buy.Best Bank Stocks To Buy For Long-TermPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe selected a variety of diversified and regional banking stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter.

US Bank, based in Minnesota, was caught up in the recent mini crisis in the banking industry. The company recently acquired Union Bank for $8 billion, which hit its capital reserve levels, and the timing was unfortunate given the selloff in the industry following that acquisition.

(NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We introduced First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) in our first quarter 2023 letter. As noted, we invested in First Citizens after they acquired Silicon Valley Bank. The investment was based on our thesis that the acquisition conservatively accreted over $8 billion to First Citizens’ common equity whereas the market was pricing in substantially less.Prior to First Citizens’ earnings release, we continued to build conviction in our analysis and sized the position to the largest in the Fund. In its May 10 earnings release, in line with our analysis, First Citizens posted ~$9.1 billion of accretion from its acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank, and the market responded accordingly. We fully exited our position after the earnings release as the market incorporated the full accretion. Our investment in First Citizens generated a ~23% return over a 5-week holding period.As we discussed in our first quarter 2023 letter, we have tracked First Citizens for several years and believe the bank is led by world-class management. The bank remains on our investment watchlist, and we remain confident the company will continue to create value for shareholders, especially in light of likely future banking sector consolidation that will benefit First Citizens’ opportunistic acquisition strategy and capital strength. We exited our position in First Citizens in favor of more attractive risk-adjusted opportunities.”7. PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

(NYSE:PNC) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $630.6 million.Artisan Partners made the following comments about PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We are taking advantage of the current weakness in bank stocks. In Q1, we purchased The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) and US Bancorp. These are banks we have known for years. They are well-managed and have solid capital positions and liquidity. At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America. All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.”6. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is an investment banking and brokerage company based in New York. The company provides capital raising and financial advisory services, equity and fixed-income products, and more.Alevizos Alevizakos, an analyst at HSBC, initiated coverage on shares of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on September 7 with a Buy rating and a price target of $99.Our hedge fund data shows 54 hedge funds long Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in the second quarter.

The company has also outperformed its industry’s decline of 0.8% over the same time frame. Moreover, it has topped the S&amp;P 500’s 0.3% decline over the same period.Let’s take a look into the factors behind this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s price appreciation. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring CF?While CF Industries is exposed to challenges from weaker nitrogen prices, it is benefiting from healthy nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and lower natural gas costs. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on rising nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally.Demand for nitrogen in North America is expected to be driven by high levels of corn planted acres in the United States and favorable farm economics. Moreover, increased planted corn acres, higher crop prices and healthy farm economics are likely to support urea demand in Brazil. CF also expects demand in India to be driven by the government’s plans to maintain high urea volumes in stock.Lower natural gas prices are also acting in the company’s favor. CF Industries saw a significant decline in natural gas costs in the second quarter of 2023. Average cost of natural gas fell to $2.75 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2023 from $7.05 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Lower natural gas costs led to a decline in the company's cost of sales. The benefits of reduced gas costs are expected to continue in the third quarter.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $712 million in the second quarter. During the first half of 2023, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares for $205 million, which included the purchase of 2 million shares for $130 million in the second quarter.Earnings estimates for CF Industries have also been going up over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CF for 2023 has increased around 1.4%. The consensus estimate for 2024 has also been revised roughly 7.8% upward over the same time frame.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, Hawkins, Inc.

We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2024. First quarter total revenue grew 8.1% to $2.34 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flow through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 110 basis points to an all-time high of 21.4%, and diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $3.70. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.83 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. Their organic revenue growth rate was 7.6%. While price increases moved near historical levels, revenue growth continues to be driven mostly from increased volume.Story continuesOur sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $260.7 million compared to $234.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11%. Our value proposition continues to resonate in our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment.All Other revenue was $254.8 million compared to $234.5 million last year. The Fire business revenue was $174.3 million, and their organic revenue growth rate was 14.2%. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $80.5 million which was down 2.7% organically compared to last year. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion to a range of $9.4 billion to $9.52 billion, a total growth rate of 6.6% to 8%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $13.85 to $14.35 to a range of $14 to $14.45, a growth rate of 7.8% to 11.2%.Mike?Copyright: kritchanut / 123RF Stock PhotoMichael Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared to $2.17 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 11%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high of 48.7% for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 47.5% last year, an increase of 120 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this record gross margin. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 50 basis points from last year.Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies we've created with our proprietary SmartTruck technology. Certainly, we've also seen a benefit from a drop in prices at the pump compared to a year ago. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 55.9% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49% for Fire Protection Services and 38.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $500.6 million compared to $440.1 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.3% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.2% compared to 14.8% last year.The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $385.1 million compared to $351.7 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $3.70 compared to $3.39 last year, an increase of 9.1%. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter grew 13% over the prior year. On September 15, we paid shareholders $138.3 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.8% from the amount paid the previous September. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt; our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%.This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. Jared?Jared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow up if needed. Thank you.See also 34 Fuel Exporting Countries in the World and 15 Best Performing Shitcoins in 2023.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.Faiza Alwy: I wanted to see if you could provide a bit more color on the new business environment. And if you've noticed any change in terms of the macro environment. Certainly, you guys are talking to your customers every day. So just a bit more perspective around what you're seeing out there in the marketplace.Todd Schneider: Great. Yes, our new business pipeline is quite good. We love the state of our sales organization, the focus that they have, the scope. And so new business is quite good, and that's a big driver of our growth that you're seeing and we see that continuing. As far as macro environment, it is -- we haven't seen any real change in our customers' behavior, I would say, since we reported last. So it's pretty consistent with what we have seen over the past few quarters. And we are watching it very, very closely and monitoring it as we move forward.Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.Manav Patnaik: I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more color, I think, in terms of the pricing strategy and then also the strong volume growth. So I think you said pricing is back to historical levels. So I'm guessing that's down in that low single-digit camp versus almost every other company talking about still, I guess, pricing higher than above and average. So it just maybe the first question is just how do we think about your pricing strategy here?Todd Schneider: Yes, it is certainly closer to historical levels, and we like that. That's, we think, appropriate based upon our cost inputs. But we're very proud of the fact that we're growing our business attractively, and we think we can continue this based upon new business being robust and our customer retention levels, being very good as well. And we're seeing that in our customer satisfaction scores as well. And then the status of our customers is -- they're continuing on in the operating environment as they have in the past. So we like where we're positioned. We like the momentum in our business, and we like how we're growing it as well, and we think it's -- it bodes well for the future.Michael Hansen: Manav, I might just add -- Manav, I might just add to that, you asked about our pricing strategy. And as we've talked in the past, our goal is operating margin improvement, right? And pricing can be a lever within that, but we have other levers. It's not the only way for us to improve margins. And so as we think about the operating margin strategy of increasing, we've got a lot of good things going on. And this is a great quarter that shows where pricing is sort of returning back to that historical level. We still increased margins quite nicely even to record levels. And again, it's just that pricing is a part of that strategy.Manav Patnaik: Yes, that make sense. That's quite impressive. And then maybe just on the strong volume growth. Could you just help provide some color on how much of that is new business, cross-selling, maybe share gains? Any color around that?Todd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Manav. I mean, it's everything. As I mentioned, our new is quite good. Our retention levels, we're very happy with, and we're cross-selling. And we've -- we're continuing to make good progress there. We're never satisfied. But our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and we're trying to make it easier to do business with us through various technologies. And I think it's showing up in our results, and we're again bullish.Operator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS.Joshua Chan: I guess could I ask about inflation and what you're seeing across your different cost buckets, labor, energy, material? And how you expect that to kind of transpire over the coming quarters as well?Todd Schneider: Yes, I'll start, and Mike wants to chime in as well. Yes, so what we're seeing from an input cost standpoint, labor is still higher than historical. But to Mike's point earlier, we're finding ways to improve operating margin in that environment still. And part of it is because productivity is quite attractive. And we're trying to position our employee partners so that they can be more successful in the marketplace, which is good for them and it's good for ourselves. And obviously, with that retention levels of our employee partners being much back -- very close to historical levels. That's good for our customers as well. Other input costs, you saw where energy was down year over prior. That is really a Q1 subject because if you recall last year, the price at the pump was very high.And so we got a little bit of a tailwind there. But we think that will be pretty muted through the balance of the fiscal year. And then last, material costs. Our global supply chain team is doing one heck of a job in trying to make sure that we're well positioned to have very competitive prices and access to all that product. And we've spoken in the past about how a very small percentage of our products are single sourced. So that positions us well as far as having access to product, but also being giving them at very competitive rates.Joshua Chan: And I guess for my follow-up, could you talk about what your CapEx expectations are this year and kind of the types of projects that you're investing in?Michael Hansen: Sure. We did see a little bit of an increase in CapEx in Q1. We are -- as we've talked, we are in the midst of implementing SAP for our Fire Protection business and that adds a little bit of CapEx. In the first quarter, we also saw -- over the last couple of years, supply chains, our vendors have had some disruption in their ability to deliver trucks being the best example. And in the first quarter, we saw a little bit of a catch-up in terms of us receiving more of those trucks. And so we saw a bit of an increase there too in the first quarter. I expect for the year that we're going to likely be right around 4%. Longer term, we still believe 3.5% to 4%. But because of SAP and sort of that catch-up might be a little closer to 4% this year.Operator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.Heather Balsky: I was hoping, first, you could talk about your exposure to the auto sector and any exposure you may have to, I guess, some of the current disruption? And then two, if you could talk about through the end markets, are there any areas where just in this macro, you're seeing softness and areas where you're seeing strength would be great?Todd Schneider: Heather. Yes, we're certainly watching what's going on with the auto worker strike, but it is not affecting us in any material way whatsoever. We have a very broad-based customer base. And as a result of that, it's not affecting us to any material degree whatsoever. And keeping in mind that we have no one customer that's greater than 1% of our revenue and no even sector that's greater than 10% for 3-digit NAICS codes. So that helps us and insulates us a bit from all that. As far as the macro environment, it really -- it varies based upon the sector, geography, whether they're goods producing or services providing. But the labor market is a little easier, but still not easy. And you see that through the -- what we've -- what we're reading with the job openings, still 9.5 million job openings.And that affects our customer base from a standpoint of them trying to attract and retain people. We would love to see those jobs filled because we think that would be really good for our customers and for the economy in general.Operator: And our next question comes from Justin Hauke from RW Baird.Justin Hauke: I wanted to ask about the First Aid margins because it kind of sustainably been higher than they have been historically and really more comparable to the Uniform Rental and the Facility Services segment. And I guess the question is, I mean, for years, that was kind of a scale business where you were building it out and it had lower margins. Are you at the point now where like that business has reached a point where it has very comparable margin sustainably to the Uniform Rental business?Todd Schneider: Yes, we really like the First Aid business. I mean it's -- that it resonates with our customer base. They -- a strong value proposition is helping our revenue growth. The mix has returned closer to historical with First Aid and Safety. And Justin, just like our other businesses, we're using various technologies to extract inefficiencies out of our business. And there's certainly no exception to that. I mentioned that our global supply chain team has done -- doing a great job in sourcing product, and we're benefiting from sourcing there. But yes, we see -- certainly, there is -- running a business is not linear. But that being said, we certainly think that gross margins in excess of 50 are sustainable in that business.Justin Hauke: Okay. Great. And then I guess the last one is kind of more procedural, I guess. But you did -- it looks like on the cash flow about $56 million spending on acquisitions in the quarter, which is a little bit higher than what you guys typically do. Do you have any comments on kind of where that was, where we should see the revenue flow from it?Todd Schneider: Well, I'll start, and Mike can chime in. The -- Justin, as you know, we love leveraging our balance sheet for M&amp;A. And we think it's a great use of cash, and we're very happy with the fact that we were able to deploy some of the cash to leverage that opportunity. And we are acquisitive in all 3 of our operating segments that are route-based. And we made acquisitions in all 3, so -- in Q1. So we're pleased with that, and we think that will -- is a great opportunity for us to bring those customers into the fold, those partners, those employee partners into the fold and provide more value and cross-sell to those customers that are now part of Cintas.Operator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.George Tong: In the past, you've talked about strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals in driving Uniform Rental's growth. Can you discuss the latest trends you're seeing in these end markets and what's fueling the growth?Todd Schneider: Yes, those are 3 great verticals for us. I mean, they're 3 great segments of the North American economy. And so, yes, we're still seeing outsized growth in those markets. And as we've chatted about in the past, it's more than just a sales effort. We've organized around them. We've got products for them. We've got technologies for them. And that is resonating with that customer base. So we think we've chosen them quite well, and there's plenty of runway in all of them. So we're, again, quite bullish on the future of those segments.George Tong: Got it. And then with respect to margins, your gross margins expanded 60 bps year-over-year in your Uniform segment. Most of that appears to be driven by lower energy costs. Can you discuss puts and takes around Uniform gross margins in the quarter and opportunities for additional margin expansion over the remainder of this year that comes above and beyond tailwinds you're seeing from lower energy costs?Todd Schneider: Yes. George, we're -- the nature of the math around our businesses, the Rental business is obviously a large percentage of it. And we're guiding towards margin expansion for the year. And we do not see energy being a tailwind for the balance of the year. So we expect margin expansion based upon certainly leverage on revenue growth, that's going to be helpful. But we're extracting those inefficiencies out of our business. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're proud of the fact that pricing is returning back to historical levels, but we're still able to grow operating margin -- gross margin and operating margin at very attractive levels and to levels that are all-time highs. So that's part of our plan. And our team is actually treating at a very high level, and we expect that, that will continue.Michael Hansen: George, I might just reiterate what I mentioned in the prepared remarks that keeping in mind that the energy benefit that we are getting is partly because we are working really hard at things like our SmartTruck initiative. So in other words, as we continue to grow really nicely with volumes, we don't need to add as many routes and trucks as we have in the past, and that creates then better fuel efficiency, if you will, throughout our network. And so that's a -- it is a proactive initiative to get energy down. And one of those proactive ways is through that SmartTruck technology.Todd Schneider: And Mike, I might add that when we extract those inefficiencies out, that's better for our customers because we're able to spend more time in front of them instead of on the road. It's certainly better for our partners, our employee partners because it makes them that much more productive, and that's good for them and our organization. And it's really good for the environment. So we think -- let's say there's a lot of boxes checked there, and we've worked hard on that technology over the years, and it's showing up. And it's benefiting not just the P&amp;L in a more simplistic fashion, but in many ways.Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.Samuel Kusswurm: This is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. I guess I want to start with another health care question here. But as it relates to your health care clients, you've talked a lot about the opportunity here, especially as more no programmers convert. But I guess I'd like to know for those health care operators who already use a service partner, what do you think your penetration rate is? And how might that compare to some of your other customer verticals?Todd Schneider: Sam, that's a good question. I don't have that in front of me. But we know this. We're in the early innings with health care. And we're coming up with more products and services that they find attractive. And that's part of our culture. We will enter into a business. But then we get out from behind our desk and we go spend time with our customers. And when we find that we find the answers to what they are most interested in by speaking to them, and our customers and our employee partners. And we're hearing from them on various areas where we can help them, and we're taking action there. So again, a very long runway in that vertical, and that's again part of our culture and will be part of how we go to market moving forward.Samuel Kusswurm: Got you. Appreciate it. Maybe just another quick one on the margins. I see SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales picked up again in the quarter compared to last year. I guess I'm wondering if there was any variable costs like your insurance expenses? Or if it was mainly some of the selling and branding investments you've talked about previously? Maybe you could just help break that out for us a little more.Michael Hansen: Nothing unusual in the quarter. We did see the -- we talked in the fourth quarter about some claims getting higher, but not structural. We saw those come back down to something more normal. But as it relates to the quarter, just some puts and takes, nothing of any significance. Our goal is to continue to leverage particularly the G&amp;A piece of that, and we're going to continue to work at that.Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities.Andrew Steinerman: I wanted to talk to you about incremental margins, which were super strong in the quarter and last quarter on a year-over-year basis. I surely know, Cintas historically has targeted 20% to 30% as a range for incremental margins. But kind of given where we are right now, it definitely feels like that kind of low end of the range, the 20%, might not be as appropriate. And so my question is, has your medium-term range for incremental margins been creeping up?Todd Schneider: Yes. 20% to 30% is our target. We -- Q1 was a very attractive incremental margins. And there's always puts and takes in every quarter as I mentioned. Running a business is not linear. But we will expect that we will be in that 20% to 30% range. I certainly like higher in the range than lower. And we are -- and I think our guide speaks to where attractive margin improvement for the year as well.Operator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo.Seth Weber: I wanted to ask just about the small tick down in Uniform Direct Sales organic growth here in the quarter. It's the first, I think, decline that we've seen there in a while. I know the comp was hard. Is there anything else that you'd call out there for that business?Todd Schneider: Certainly, what we have seen outstanding performance from that business over the past really 2 years. And -- but it is -- as we've spoken about in the past, the Uniform Direct Sale business tends to be a little bit lumpier based upon rollouts of large programs, whether it's hospitality or a Fortune 1000-type customer. So nothing more than that. We still are bullish on the future of that business and for the year and moving forward.Seth Weber: Do you think, Todd, do you think that business could be up for the year? Or do you think that's kind of flattish or down?Todd Schneider: I would suspect -- well, we expect all of our businesses to grow. So I would suspect that we would see that up. But just the comps are set with the level of what we dealt with hospitality in that vertical, in Fortune 1000, the level of where employees came back so strongly. I wouldn't suspect that you'll see anywhere near the level of growth that we've seen in the last couple of years, but we expect it to grow.Michael Hansen: Seth, I might point out that the last 2 years have -- they have been a significant recapture of what we sort of lost in that pandemic period of time. In our fiscal '22, that business grew organically over 50%; in fiscal '23, it was almost 30%. So there was a lot of recapture going on, but keep in mind that our longer-term goal for that business, Todd expects it to grow, but it's probably more of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio.Seth Weber: Right. Okay. Understood. And then maybe just on the First Aid and Safety business, given the margin strength that you're seeing there, can you talk about are you seeing any incremental competition in that space? Are you seeing any bigger players trying to get into that space or just smaller regional players getting more active?Todd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Seth. Certainly, it's a very competitive marketplace and First Aid products, Safety products, there is hundreds of competitors out there. There's many, many ways to procure those products, whether it be van delivered or e-commerce, you name it, we see it there. But as a result of that, it's a very competitive market. And we've talked about the health and safety of employees being the #1 item that businesses are focused on. And when that occurs, there's certainly -- it attracts plenty of people into the marketplace because the value proposition of taking great care of employees is resonating with folks. And so yes, it's a very competitive environment, and I'm sure it will continue to be.Operator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.Stephanie Moore: Actually, maybe continuing on that last question there. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and your more core Uniform ancillary product segment? As you continue to win new business, where are you seeing the majority of that new business coming from? Is it nonprogrammers, some of the regional players, larger players? Any color there would be helpful.Todd Schneider: So I've been in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business my entire career, 34 years. It's been highly competitive my entire career, and I'm sure it will continue to be that way. But we haven't seen a change in the landscape. It's always really competitive. So that being said, we -- our sales organization is highly skilled. And what we know is, there is a massive opportunity with the no program market. And for years, our organization has been focused on expanding the pie, and they are continuing to do exactly that. And when we talk about expanding the pie, they are -- those employees at a no programmer mean -- they're wearing garments, right? It's -- but they are -- they may be buying it themselves. They may be buying it through a catalog, it might be a centralized program for the company, but they're purchasing them.And then we provide more value to them with the products and services that we offer, whether they're unique products like Carhartt or Chef Works or Landau, great branded programs. But the no-program market is really attractive for us, and we find that market sees really good value in what we're offering. So we're focused on expanding that high, and that will continue.Stephanie Moore: Got it. And just a follow-up, if I may. You noted that retention level continue to be really high. I'm just curious, in this current environment, what do you think is resonating the most with your customers that your sales force kind of goes in? Is it kind of the willingness to work with them on price? Is it the product offering, your scale? I'd love to just get your thoughts on what do you think is resonating the most to drive such a nice retention level.Todd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Stephanie. That's a very complicated answer because there's so many inputs to it. But it starts with being highly focused on taking incredibly good care of our customers and attracting and retaining the very best people. But then giving them product, services, tools so that they can not only have the intent to take great care of our customers, but do just exactly that. So -- and that gets into great products that I mentioned earlier, the service -- focus that we -- or the tools that we're making that make it easier to do business with us. But it gets down to our people and positioning them to take a really, really good care of our customers and then executing on that. And they're executing at a really high level.And we talk often about when markets -- when things are challenging, when it's hard to attract people, when it's hard to procure products, when it's hard to operate in the marketplace, it gives us a chance to shine. And our culture is shining through. And our people are doing one heck of a job in taking care of our customers.Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.Scott Schneeberger: Guys, you've certainly -- it sounds like you really want to speak to a SmartTruck because that's been going very well. I was hoping you could add also on automation to facilities. And where I'm going here, just kind of an update on where I'm going here is it sounds like you've been getting nice efficiencies and you still see more room to run. Is there any quantification you can put on that? I know you're looking for margins up this year overall business. But maybe just help us get an idea of what's at play there and how much you can do.Todd Schneider: Scott, I'll start. Mike, if you would like to chime in there. We're deploying technology, and you can call it automation, you can call it technology, you can call it digital. We're deploying that across all of our businesses and across all areas of our business as well, and we've been focused on that for years. But there certainly is -- we're seeing some real benefits there with our investment with SAP, with our investments -- our partnerships with Google and with Verizon. And it's -- those are -- we see that there's plenty of opportunities still to come there to improve in the efficiencies of our business and to automate certain functions. And we call it -- make it easier for our customers to do business and make it easier for our employee partners to take great care of our customers.The more we can invest there, we think it's an incredibly good use of our balance sheet because it positions us well for not just the short term, but the long term as well.Michael Hansen: Yes. There are so many details that go into all of the things that Todd just talked about, that it's really hard to put a number on it. Our goal is, as you've heard us say, is continue to improve margins. We have a number of different levers to do so. Our goal is incrementals in that 20% to 30% range, recognizing we're at the bottom of that range today. But it's hard to put a specific number on what's left because we're always working on what's -- what more can we do. And there are so many details and so many different projects we're working on. So our guide certainly does imply for continued margin improvement over last year, and that's the way we think about it.Scott Schneeberger: Great. Appreciate that. The -- you just referenced SAP, and you mentioned CapEx may be high end of the range this year, working on some implementation in the Fire segment. Could you just speak to -- would that have a tail to next year? How much more -- I mean, are we going to see SAP projects for years to come? Just a sense of what you have on the spend side going forward.Michael Hansen: From a Fire perspective, the -- we are in the midst of the early innings of the implementation. And so we'll see some pressure in the Fire margins a little bit this year and a little bit next year. The synergies and the benefits don't come overnight. It's not a flip of the switch. And so we -- just like we did with the Rental business and the First Aid business before that, we need to get onto the platform. It takes a little bit of time to get really good at using the platform, and then we really start to see the benefits accelerate just like we have in First Aid and Rental. Now that's a -- Fire is a smaller part of our business, but we certainly expect that those benefits will come. As it relates to SAP, SAP is not -- it's a journey, right?And we are -- even though we are on SAP and will be for most of our business after the Fire Protection business gets on, there are constant things to learn from SAP. There are new initiatives in working with SAP and Google and Verizon that create new and different things. And so we look at this -- I think Todd's talked about it as one of his largest initiatives in terms of technology. And it's a journey. It's not a flip of the switch. We turn on new systems here and there. So we're in the midst of that. We'll continue to invest in all of that. And our expectation is, it's going to continue to bring benefits into the future.Todd Schneider: Scott, to expand upon what Mike said, it is a journey. But when you're on that journey, there is benefits -- a long, long tail of benefits as well. And so we will continue to invest appropriately. We have relationships at a very high level in each of those organizations, and it's going to bear fruit for us. And that's part of our plan. It's not easy. It's very challenging to go through these processes. But our team has shown the wherewithal to not only digest the change, but then leverage the opportunities that are in front of them.Operator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum.Shlomo Rosenbaum: Todd, maybe you can just peel the onion back a little bit more on that margin on the First Aid side? I know you pointed to some sourcing and stuff like that. But it seems like the business has gone from mid-teens to low 20s in the course of the year. And I was wondering if there -- is there something to do with the route optimization? Is it mix related, pricing? Anything else that operationally made such a significant difference? And after that, I have just a question on the labor environment for you guys yourselves? Are you -- is it easier for you guys to source people for what you need?Todd Schneider: Good question, Shlomo. Yes. Again, we love the First Aid business. But we're -- there's so many inputs to margin expansion, and we're leveraging them all. It starts with really good revenue growth, and we're seeing that. And that's in a big way because the value proposition is resonating, the products, the services that we offer in the marketplace, trying to attract and retain people is still challenging. And people are trying to -- customers are trying to take really good care of their people. And we're benefiting from that and we're helping them accomplish exactly that. We're helping them run their business better. So that's helpful. The mix, as you know, has -- back during the pandemic, it was certainly so much more focused on safety products, a lot of clubs and a lot of sanitizer and those types of items.And that has abated a bit, and the mix is back focused on First Aid and those types of products, more recurring revenue type. And yes, we are absolutely leveraging technology to make it easier to do business, but also to position our partners, our employee partners to provide more value to our customers. And SmartTruck is a component of that. We did have a little bit of energy tailwind, 40 basis points. But as Mike cited earlier, not all that's because of the price at the pump. That is also because we are extracting the inefficiencies out. And we always talk around here about how we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. That's better for our customers, that's better for our employee partners. And all that is contributing.And then lastly, as I mentioned, our supply chain team has done a great job. They are leveraging the opportunities there. The larger we get in that business, the more leverage they have, and they're executing at a high level. And -- so many inputs that are contributing to it, and -- but the -- what's really encouraging is, we see those having an opportunity to continue in the future. So certainly, no event is more of a process.Shlomo Rosenbaum: And then just the labor environment on your own, like for the people that you're sourcing?Todd Schneider: Yes. Pardon me. So from a labor standpoint, yes. As I mentioned earlier, it is easier, but not easy. And we are looking for great people. We want to hire not only people that are employed somewhere else, but happily employed, which is very challenging. And -- but we think we have a great employee value proposition as well. And so we're highly focused on that. So -- but yes, easier than it was a year ago. But Shlomo, throughout my career, it's always been challenging. It's a little bit more challenging than it has been historically, but not what it once was a year ago or so.Operator: And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.Kartik Mehta: I know there's a lot of questions and maybe thoughts on what happens to new sales. And I'm wondering, if you go back to kind of 2008, 2009 and hopefully never have that recession again. But if you look at new sales back then, how did Cintas perform for new sales? And any lessons from that you would take as we move forward?Todd Schneider: Yes, Kartik. First of all, we're a really different company today than we were in 2008, 2009. We have a much more diversified customer base. We're now -- today 70% of our customers are service is providing, 30% are goods producing. We have significant verticals that we didn't have as well, health care, education, government. So we think we're really well positioned for whenever the next recession is. And I remember '08, '09 because I was running the sales organization back then. And our value propositions still resonated with people, and we still sold new business. And we did so at attractive rates. As I mentioned, it's not always are we asking for new money. Sometimes it's just a redirection of those from somewhere else to us, not only in a -- maybe a direct competitor standpoint, but also they're purchasing clothing, they're purchasing items to take care of the facilities.So we think we're well positioned. I might also mention, you didn't ask specifically about it, but we love having a pristine balance sheet. And we think whenever the next recession is that might open up opportunities for us. And just the fact that we've -- our organization is focused on fighting through whatever the economic environment is, taking great care of our customers, taking great care of our employee partners. And we've grown sales in 52 of the last 54 years. And we suspect that whatever the economic environment is, we believe we're going to be successful in it.Michael Hansen: Kartik, I might add, Todd might be a little modest. He was running that organization. It was a difficult environment, and he and the sales team exceeded their internal goals and really continued to show that value even in tough times, as Todd mentioned. And as he also talked about, our customer base is quite a bit broader than it was back then, and our sales team is a little bit different. But the really good news is even back then, in the deepest, longest, broadest recession we'd seen in 100 years, we still sold a lot of new business. And it's a nice reflection of the value proposition that we have.Kartik Mehta: Yes. And just as a follow-up, if you look at the First Aid and Safety business, you're doing really well in it. Is there a way you would look at to say a certain percentage is recurring? Do you consider a certain percentage recurring? I know you don't have long-term contracts in that business. But just from a demand standpoint and what you've seen from a historical standpoint?Todd Schneider: Yes, Kartik, it's a good question. I don't have that in front of me, but I know it's -- it has returned much closer to historical or even higher as far as what we see from a repeat -- recurring type of revenue. And we want to provide value to the customers, whatever product services they want. It's just the nature of it, what we provide, whether it be First Aid supplies, access to AEDs, access to eyewash stations, access to clean water through our WaterBreak offering. Those are all items that are really important to our customers more so today than they were pre-pandemic, and we think that, that trend will continue.Operator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.Toni Kaplan: So one of your competitors has been talking about using a strategy where they're incentivizing their drivers to cross-sell products. Can you talk about why you don't use that strategy? What the disadvantages are that you have found when doing that?Todd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Toni. I'm glad you asked because my first job 34 years ago was on the trucks. And we have been cross-selling our products via our -- we call them our service sales representatives. We've been cross-selling them since I started, and I'm sure it was in place well before I started as well. So we see -- the fact that we have 12,000 or so trucks that roll out of our parking lots every single day that are focused on taking great care of our customers, when they roll out of those parking lots, they're spending time in those businesses. And they have eyes. They have ears, they have minds, and they see what's going on in those businesses, and they see opportunities. And it always has been and always will be a key component of our growth trajectory because we see that infrastructure as a real advantage.And we leverage it and make sure that those service providers, either they provide more products and services or they provide a lead to provide more products and services based upon the nature of the product that the customer might be interested in.Michael Hansen: And Toni, we've talked a lot about this over the last -- more than 10 years, we've got customers of all different sizes, verticals, et cetera. And so while we do certainly expect those service sales reps to continue to penetrate and sell, we recognize that some businesses are just more complex than others, are larger than others. And so sometimes, there's a strategy to enhance that opportunity. And it might be through, for example, in health care. We have dedicated people that really do reach out to the decision makers. So it's not just the service sales rep, but it's also other people that have relationship responsibilities that are looking for those new and different penetration opportunities. It's not as simple just to simply say we're going to go in and have a service sales rep or an SSR go into each customer and sell it, all customers are so different. And so we need a strategy that can attack all types of customers, and we do.Todd Schneider: Toni, we know that our customer satisfaction scores are really good. And in large part because they really like our people. They like our service providers, our frontline service providers. And we leverage that. And whether it be, as Mike mentioned, a more -- a smaller type customer, we can cross-sell via the service provider. A larger one that's a little bit more complicated. There might be a need for some air cover, for some help there. But nevertheless, that's always been an important component of our strategy and always will be.Toni Kaplan: That is super helpful. I wanted to also ask, I think the last few calls, you've been talking more about technology and investments and things of this sort. Are there any, I guess, technology capabilities that you think you still need? Will -- that you either are getting through hiring technology people or maybe even doing M&amp;A? Like -- and maybe you've done it, maybe you still have yet to do, but are there any technology capabilities that you need that basically would be helped through M&amp;A or hiring internally new technology people?Todd Schneider: Yes, Toni, great question. So we are always on the lookout for those opportunities. We think we have a really strong technology platform that we can build off of. But we know that the answer for what our customers are interested in is with spending time with our customers, and our employee partners are the ones who discern those opportunities. So we're always asking now, how do we make it easier to do business, what -- is there any void? And frankly, that's where most of our investments have come from, that information, been trying to make it easier to do business with us. So we're always in search of trying to be a world-class service provider, but having an incredibly strong technology platform that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us, that makes it easier for our employee partners, our service providers to create a world-class experience for those customers.So yes, we're in search of whether it's -- we buy it or we bolt it on to our current platform or we created ourselves, all of those are of interest to us, and we'll be moving forward.Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley for closing remarks.Jared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Jared S. MattingleyThank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our fiscal 2024 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.Story continuesTodd M. SchneiderThank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2024. First quarter total revenue grew 8.1% to $2.34 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flow through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 110 basis points to an all-time high of 21.4%, and diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $3.70. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.83 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. Their organic revenue growth rate was 7.6%.While price increases moved near historical levels, revenue growth continues to be driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance.Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $260.7 million compared to $234.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11%. Our value proposition continues to resonate in our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $254.8 million compared to $234.5 million last year. The Fire business revenue was $174.3 million, and their organic revenue growth rate was 14.2%. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was [$80.5 million,] which was down 2.7% organically compared to last year. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year.We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion to a range of $9.4 billion to $9.52 billion, a total growth rate of 6.6% to 8%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $13.85 to $14.35 to a range of $14 to $14.45, a growth rate of 7.8% to 11.2%. Mike?J. Michael HansenThanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared to $2.17 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 11%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high of 48.7% for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 47.5% last year, an increase of 120 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this record gross margin. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 50 basis points from last year. Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies we've created with our proprietary SmartTruck technology. Certainly, we've also seen a benefit from a drop in prices at the pump compared to a year ago. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 55.9% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49% for Fire Protection Services and 38.7% for Uniform Direct Sale.Operating income of $500.6 million compared to $440.1 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.3% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.2% compared to 14.8% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $385.1 million compared to $351.7 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $3.70 compared to $3.39 last year, an increase of 9.1%. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter grew 13% over the prior year. On September 15, we paid shareholders $138.3 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.8% from the amount paid the previous September. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt; our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Guidance includes the impact of having one more work day in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra work day comes in our fiscal third quarter. Jared?Jared S. MattingleyThat concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. (Operator Instructions)Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.Faiza AlwyI wanted to see if you could provide a bit more color on the new business environment. And if you've noticed any change in terms of the macro environment. Certainly, you guys are talking to your customers every day. So just a bit more perspective around what you're seeing out there in the marketplace.Todd M. SchneiderGreat. Yes, our new business pipeline is quite good. We love the state of our sales organization, the focus that they have, the scope. And so new business is quite good, and that's a big driver of our growth that you're seeing and we see that continuing. As far as macro environment, it is -- we haven't seen any real change in our customers' behavior, I would say, since we reported last. So it's pretty consistent with what we have seen over the past few quarters. And we are watching it very, very closely and monitoring it as we move.OperatorOur next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.Manav Shiv PatnaikI just wanted to see if you could give us a little more color, I think, in terms of the pricing strategy and then also the strong volume growth. So I think you said pricing is back to historical levels. So I'm guessing that's down in that low single-digit camp versus almost every other company talking about still, I guess, pricing higher than above and average. So it just maybe the first question is just how do we think about your pricing strategy here?Todd M. SchneiderYes, it is certainly closer to historical levels, and we like that. That's, we think, appropriate based upon our cost inputs. But we're very proud of the fact that we're growing our business attractively, and we think we can continue this based upon new business being robust and our customer retention levels, being very good as well. And we're seeing that in our customer satisfaction scores as well. And then the status of our customers is -- they're continuing on in the operating environment as they have in the past. So we like where we're positioned. We like the momentum in our business, and we like how we're growing it as well, and we think it's -- it bodes well for the future.J. Michael HansenManav, I might just add -- Manav, I might just add to that, you asked about our pricing strategy. And as we've talked in the past, our goal is operating margin improvement, right? And pricing can be a lever within that, but we have other levers. It's not the only way for us to improve margins. And so as we think about the operating margin strategy of increasing, we've got a lot of good things going on. And this is a great quarter that shows where pricing is sort of returning back to that historical level. We still increased margins quite nicely even to record levels. And again, it's just that pricing is a part of that strategy.Manav Shiv PatnaikYes, that make sense. That's quite impressive. And then maybe just on the strong volume growth. Could you just help provide some color on how much of that is new business, cross-selling, maybe share gains? Any color around that?Todd M. SchneiderYes. Good question, Manav. I mean, it's everything. As I mentioned, our new is quite good. Our retention levels, we're very happy with, and we're cross-selling. And we've -- we're continuing to make good progress there. We're never satisfied. But our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and we're trying to make it easier to do business with us through various technologies. And I think it's showing up in our results, and we're again bullish.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS.Joshua K. ChanI guess could I ask about inflation and what you're seeing across your different cost buckets, labor, energy, material? And how you expect that to kind of transpire over the coming quarters as well?Todd M. SchneiderYes, I'll start, and Mike wants to chime in as well. Yes, so what we're seeing from an input cost standpoint. Labor is still higher than historical. But to Mike's point earlier, we're finding ways to improve operating margin in that environment still. And part of it is because productivity is quite attractive. And we're trying to position our employee partners so that they can be more successful in the marketplace, which is good for them and it's good for ourselves. And obviously, with that retention levels of our employee partners being much back -- very close to historical levels. That's good for our customers as well. Other input costs, you saw where energy was down year over prior. That is really a Q1 subject because if you recall last year, the price at the pump was very high. And so we got a little bit of a tailwind there. But we think that will be pretty muted through the balance of the fiscal year. And then last, material costs. Our global supply chain team is doing one heck of a job in trying to make sure that we're well positioned to have very competitive prices and access to all that product. And we've spoken in the past about how a very small percentage of our products are single sourced. So that positions us well as far as having access to product, but also being giving them at very competitive rates.Joshua K. ChanAnd I guess for my follow-up, could you talk about what your CapEx expectations are this year and kind of the types of projects that you're investing in?J. Michael HansenSure. We did see a little bit of an increase in CapEx in Q1. We are -- as we've talked, we are in the midst of implementing SAP for our Fire Protection business and that adds a little bit of CapEx. In the first quarter, we also saw -- over the last couple of years, supply chains, our vendors have had some disruption in their ability to deliver trucks being the best example. And in the first quarter, we saw a little bit of a catch-up in terms of us receiving more of those trucks. And so we saw a bit of an increase there too in the first quarter. I expect for the year that we're going to likely be right around 4%. Longer term, we still believe 3.5% to 4%. But because of SAP and sort of that catch-up might be a little closer to 4% this year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.Heather Nicole BalskyI was hoping, first, you could talk about your exposure to the auto sector and any exposure you may have to, I guess, some of the current disruption? And then two, if you could talk about through the end markets, are there any areas where just in this macro, you're seeing softness and areas where you're seeing strength would be great?Todd M. SchneiderHeather. Yes, we're certainly watching what's going on with the auto worker strike, but it is not affecting us in any material way whatsoever. We have a very broad-based customer base. And as a result of that, it's not affecting us to any material degree whatsoever. And keeping in mind that we have no one customer that's greater than 1% of our revenue and no even sector that's greater than 10% for 3-digit NAICS codes. So that helps us and insulates us a bit from all that. As far as the macro environment, it really -- it varies based upon the sector, geography, whether they're goods producing or services providing. But the labor market is a little easier, but still not easy. And you see that through the -- what we've -- what we're reading with the job openings, still 9.5 million job openings. And that affects our customer base from a standpoint of them trying to attract and retain people. We would love to see those jobs filled because we think that would be really good for our customers and for the economy in general.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Justin Hauke from RW Baird.Justin P. HaukeI wanted to ask about the First Aid margins because it kind of sustainably been higher than they have been historically and really more comparable to the Uniform Rental and the Facility Services segment. And I guess the question is, I mean, for years, that was kind of a scale business where you were building it out and it had lower margins. Are you at the point now where like that business has reached a point where it has very comparable margin sustainably to the Uniform Rental business?Todd M. SchneiderYes, we really like the First Aid business. I mean it's -- that it resonates with our customer base. They -- a strong value proposition is helping our revenue growth. The mix has returned closer to historical with First Aid and Safety. And Justin, just like our other businesses, we're using various technologies to extract inefficiencies out of our business. And there's certainly no exception to that. I mentioned that our global supply chain team has done -- doing a great job in sourcing product, and we're benefiting from sourcing there. But yes, we see -- certainly, there is -- running a business is not linear. But that being said, we certainly think that gross margins in excess of 50 are sustainable in that business.Justin P. HaukeOkay. Great. And then I guess the last one is kind of more procedural, I guess. But you did -- it looks like on the cash flow about $56 million spending on acquisitions in the quarter, which is a little bit higher than what you guys typically do. Do you have any comments on kind of where that was, where we should see the revenue flow from it?Todd M. SchneiderWell, I'll start, and Mike can chime in. The -- Justin, as you know, we love leveraging our balance sheet for M&amp;A. And we think it's a great use of cash, and we're very happy with the fact that we were able to deploy some of the cash to leverage that opportunity.And we are acquisitive in all 3 of our operating segments that are route-based. And we made acquisitions in all 3, so -- in Q1. So we're pleased with that, and we think that will -- is a great opportunity for us to bring those customers into the fold, those partners, those employee partners into the fold and provide more value and cross-sell to those customers that are now part of Cintas.OperatorAnd our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.Keen Fai TongIn the past, you've talked about strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals in driving Uniform Rental's growth. Can you discuss the latest trends you're seeing in these end markets and what's fueling the growth?Todd M. SchneiderYes, those are 3 great verticals for us. I mean, they're 3 great segments of the North American economy. And so, yes, we're still seeing outsized growth in those markets. And as we've chatted about in the past, it's more than just a sales effort. We've organized around them. We've got products for them. We've got technologies for them. And that is resonating with that customer base. So we think we've chosen them quite well, and there's plenty of runway in all of them. So we're, again, quite bullish on the future of those segments.Keen Fai TongGot it. And then with respect to margins, your gross margins expanded 60 bps year-over-year in your Uniform segment. Most of that appears to be driven by lower energy costs. Can you discuss puts and takes around Uniform gross margins in the quarter and opportunities for additional margin expansion over the remainder of this year that comes above and beyond tailwinds you're seeing from lower energy costs?Todd M. SchneiderYes. George, we're -- the nature of the math around our businesses, the Rental business is obviously a large percentage of it. And we're guiding towards margin expansion for the year. And we do not see energy being a tailwind for the balance of the year. So we expect margin expansion based upon certainly leverage on revenue growth, that's going to be helpful. But we're extracting those inefficiencies out of our business. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're proud of the fact that pricing is returning back to historical levels, but we're still able to grow operating margin -- gross margin and operating margin at very attractive levels and to levels that are all-time highs. So that's part of our plan. And our team is actually treating at a very high level, and we expect that, that will continue.J. Michael HansenGeorge, I might just reiterate what I mentioned in the prepared remarks that keeping in mind that the energy benefit that we are getting is partly because we are working really hard at things like our SmartTruck initiative. So in other words, as we continue to grow really nicely with volumes, we don't need to add as many routes and trucks as we have in the past, and that creates then better fuel efficiency, if you will, throughout our network. And so that's a -- it is a proactive initiative to get energy down. And one of those proactive ways is through that SmartTruck technology.Todd M. SchneiderAnd Mike, I might add that when we extract those inefficiencies out, that's better for our customers because we're able to spend more time in front of them instead of on the road. It's certainly better for our partners, our employee partners because it makes them that much more productive, and that's good for them and our organization. And it's really good for the environment. So we think -- let's say there's a lot of boxes checked there, and we've worked hard on that technology over the years, and it's showing up. And it's benefiting not just the P&amp;L in a more simplistic fashion, but in many ways.OperatorOur next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.Samuel KusswurmThis is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. I guess I want to start with another health care question here. But as it relates to your health care clients, you've talked a lot about the opportunity here, especially as more no programmers convert. But I guess I'd like to know for those health care operators who already use a service partner, what do you think your penetration rate is? And how might that compare to some of your other customer verticals?Todd M. SchneiderSam, that's a good question. I don't have that in front of me. But we know this. We're in the early innings with health care. And we're coming up with more products and services that they find attractive. And that's part of our culture. We will enter into a business. But then we get out from behind our desk and we go spend time with our customers. And when we find that we find the answers to what they are most interested in by speaking to them, and our customers and our employee partners. And we're hearing from them on various areas where we can help them, and we're taking action there. So again, a very long runway in that vertical, and that's again part of our culture and will be part of how we go to market moving forward.Samuel KusswurmGot you. Appreciate it. Maybe just another quick one on the margins. I see SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales picked up again in the quarter compared to last year. I guess I'm wondering if there was any variable costs like your insurance expenses? Or if it was mainly some of the selling and branding investments you've talked about previously? Maybe you could just help break that out for us a little more.J. Michael HansenNothing unusual in the quarter. We did see the -- we talked in the fourth quarter about some claims getting higher, but not structural. We saw those come back down to something more normal. But as it relates to the quarter, just some puts and takes, nothing of any significance. Our goal is to continue to leverage particularly the G&amp;A piece of that, and we're going to continue to work at that.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities.Andrew Charles SteinermanI wanted to talk to you about incremental margins, which were super strong in the quarter and last quarter on a year-over-year basis. I surely know, Cintas historically has targeted 20% to 30% as a range for incremental margins. But kind of given where we are right now, it definitely feels like that kind of low end of the range, the 20%, might not be as appropriate. And so my question is, has your medium-term range for incremental margins been creeping up?Todd M. SchneiderYes. 20% to 30% is our target. We -- Q1 was a very attractive incremental margins. And there's always puts and takes in every quarter as I mentioned. Running a business is not linear. But we will expect that we will be in that 20% to 30% range. I certainly like higher in the range than lower. And we are -- and I think our guide speaks to where attractive margin improvement for the year as well.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo.Seth Robert WeberI wanted to ask just about the small tick down in Uniform Direct Sales organic growth here in the quarter. It's the first, I think, decline that we've seen there in a while. I know the comp was hard. Is there anything else that you'd call out there for that business?Todd M. SchneiderCertainly, what we have seen outstanding performance from that business over the past really 2 years. And -- but it is -- as we've spoken about in the past, the Uniform Direct Sale business tends to be a little bit lumpier based upon rollouts of large programs, whether it's hospitality or a Fortune 1000-type customer. So nothing more than that. We still are bullish on the future of that business and for the year and moving forward.Seth Robert WeberDo you think, Todd, do you think that business could be up for the year? Or do you think that's kind of flattish or down?Todd M. SchneiderI would suspect -- well, we expect all of our businesses to grow. So I would suspect that we would see that up. But just the comps are set with the level of what we dealt with hospitality in that vertical, in Fortune 1000, the level of where employees came back so strongly. I wouldn't suspect that you'll see anywhere near the level of growth that we've seen in the last couple of years, but we expect it to grow.J. Michael HansenSeth, I might point out that the last 2 years have -- they have been a significant recapture of what we sort of lost in that pandemic period of time. In our fiscal '22, that business grew organically over 50%; in fiscal '23, it was almost 30%. So there was a lot of recapture going on, but keep in mind that our longer-term goal for that business, Todd expects it to grow, but it's probably more of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio.Seth Robert WeberRight. Okay. Understood. And then maybe just on the First Aid and Safety business, given the margin strength that you're seeing there, can you talk about are you seeing any incremental competition in that space? Are you seeing any bigger players trying to get into that space or just smaller regional players getting more active?Todd M. SchneiderYes. Good question, Seth. Certainly, it's a very competitive marketplace and First Aid products, Safety products, there is hundreds of competitors out there. There's many, many ways to procure those products, whether it be van delivered or e-commerce, you name it, we see it there. But as a result of that, it's a very competitive market. And we've talked about the health and safety of employees being the #1 item that businesses are focused on. And when that occurs, there's certainly -- it attracts plenty of people into the marketplace because the value proposition of taking great care of employees is resonating with folks. And so yes, it's a very competitive environment, and I'm sure it will continue to be.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreActually, maybe continuing on that last question there. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and your more core Uniform ancillary product segment? As you continue to win new business, where are you seeing the majority of that new business coming from? Is it nonprogrammers, some of the regional players, larger players? Any color there would be helpful.Todd M. SchneiderSo I've been in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business my entire career, 34 years. It's been highly competitive my entire career, and I'm sure it will continue to be that way. But we haven't seen a change in the landscape. It's always really competitive. So that being said, we -- our sales organization is highly skilled. And what we know is, there is a massive opportunity with the no program market. And for years, our organization has been focused on expanding the pie, and they are continuing to do exactly that. And when we talk about expanding the pie, they are -- those employees at a no programmer mean -- they're wearing garments, right? It's -- but they are -- they may be buying it themselves. They may be buying it through a catalog, it might be a centralized program for the company, but they're purchasing them. And then we provide more value to them with the products and services that we offer, whether they're unique products like Carhartt or Chef Works or Landau, great branded programs. But the no-program market is really attractive for us, and we find that market sees really good value in what we're offering. So we're focused on expanding that high, and that will continue.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreGot it. And just a follow-up, if I may. You noted that retention level continue to be really high. I'm just curious, in this current environment, what do you think is resonating the most with your customers that your sales force kind of goes in? Is it kind of the willingness to work with them on price? Is it the product offering, your scale? I'd love to just get your thoughts on what do you think is resonating the most to drive such a nice retention level.Todd M. SchneiderYes. Great question, Stephanie. That's a very complicated answer because there's so many inputs to it. But it starts with being highly focused on taking incredibly good care of our customers and attracting and retaining the very best people. But then giving them product, services, tools so that they can not only have the intent to take great care of our customers, but do just exactly that. So -- and that gets into great products that I mentioned earlier, the service -- focus that we -- or the tools that we're making that make it easier to do business with us. But it gets down to our people and positioning them to take a really, really good care of our customers and then executing on that. And they're executing at a really high level. And we talk often about when markets -- when things are challenging, when it's hard to attract people, when it's hard to procure products, when it's hard to operate in the marketplace, it gives us a chance to shine. And our culture is shining through. And our people are doing one heck of a job in taking care of our customers.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerGuys, you've certainly -- it sounds like you really want to speak to a SmartTruck because that's been going very well. I was hoping you could add also on automation to facilities. And where I'm going here, just kind of an update on where I'm going here is it sounds like you've been getting nice efficiencies and you still see more room to run. Is there any quantification you can put on that? I know you're looking for margins up this year overall business. But maybe just help us get an idea of what's at play there and how much you can do.Todd M. SchneiderScott, I'll start. Mike, if you would like to chime in there. We're deploying technology, and you can call it automation, you can call it technology, you can call it digital. We're deploying that across all of our businesses and across all areas of our business as well, and we've been focused on that for years. But there certainly is -- we're seeing some real benefits there with our investment with SAP, with our investments -- our partnerships with Google and with Verizon. And it's -- those are -- we see that there's plenty of opportunities still to come there to improve in the efficiencies of our business and to automate certain functions. And we call it -- make it easier for our customers to do business and make it easier for our employee partners to take great care of our customers. The more we can invest there, we think it's an incredibly good use of our balance sheet because it positions us well for not just the short term, but the long term as well.J. Michael HansenYes. There are so many details that go into all of the things that Todd just talked about, that it's really hard to put a number on it. Our goal is, as you've heard us say, is continue to improve margins. We have a number of different levers to do so. Our goal is incrementals in that 20% to 30% range, recognizing we're at the bottom of that range today. But it's hard to put a specific number on what's left because we're always working on what's -- what more can we do. And there are so many details and so many different projects we're working on. So our guide certainly does imply for continued margin improvement over last year, and that's the way we think about it.Scott Andrew SchneebergerGreat. Appreciate that. The -- you just referenced SAP, and you mentioned CapEx may be high end of the range this year, working on some implementation in the Fire segment. Could you just speak to -- would that have a tail to next year? How much more -- I mean, are we going to see SAP projects for years to come? Just a sense of what you have on the spend side going forward.J. Michael HansenFrom a Fire perspective, the -- we are in the midst of the early innings of the implementation. And so we'll see some pressure in the Fire margins a little bit this year and a little bit next year. The synergies and the benefits don't come overnight. It's not a flip of the switch. And so we -- just like we did with the Rental business and the First Aid business before that, we need to get onto the platform. It takes a little bit of time to get really good at using the platform, and then we really start to see the benefits accelerate just like we have in First Aid and Rental. Now that's a -- Fire is a smaller part of our business, but we certainly expect that those benefits will come. As it relates to SAP, SAP is not -- it's a journey, right? And we are -- even though we are on SAP and will be for most of our business after the Fire Protection business gets on, there are constant things to learn from SAP. There are new initiatives in working with SAP and Google and Verizon that create new and different things. And so we look at this -- I think Todd's talked about it as one of his largest initiatives in terms of technology. And it's a journey. It's not a flip of the switch. We turn on new systems here and there. So we're in the midst of that. We'll continue to invest in all of that. And our expectation is, it's going to continue to bring benefits into the future.Todd M. SchneiderScott, to expand upon what Mike said, it is a journey. But when you're on that journey, there is benefits -- a long, long tail of benefits as well. And so we will continue to invest appropriately. We have relationships at a very high level in each of those organizations, and it's going to bear fruit for us. And that's part of our plan. It's not easy. It's very challenging to go through these processes. But our team has shown the wherewithal to not only digest the change, but then leverage the opportunities that are in front of them.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum.Shlomo H. RosenbaumTodd, maybe you can just peel the onion back a little bit more on that margin on the First Aid side? I know you pointed to some sourcing and stuff like that. But it seems like the business has gone from mid-teens to low 20s in the course of the year. And I was wondering if there -- is there something to do with the route optimization? Is it mix related, pricing? Anything else that operationally made such a significant difference? And after that, I have just a question on the labor environment for you guys yourselves? Are you -- is it easier for you guys to source people for what you need?Todd M. SchneiderGood question, Shlomo. Yes. Again, we love the First Aid business. But we're -- there's so many inputs to margin expansion, and we're leveraging them all. It starts with really good revenue growth, and we're seeing that. And that's in a big way because the value proposition is resonating, the products, the services that we offer in the marketplace, trying to attract and retain people is still challenging. And people are trying to -- customers are trying to take really good care of their people. And we're benefiting from that and we're helping them accomplish exactly that. We're helping them run their business better. So that's helpful. The mix, as you know, has -- back during the pandemic, it was certainly so much more focused on safety products, a lot of clubs and a lot of sanitizer and those types of items. And that has abated a bit, and the mix is back focused on First Aid and those types of products, more recurring revenue type. And yes, we are absolutely leveraging technology to make it easier to do business, but also to position our partners, our employee partners to provide more value to our customers. And SmartTruck is a component of that. We did have a little bit of energy tailwind, 40 basis points. But as Mike cited earlier, not all that's because of the price at the pump. That is also because we are extracting the inefficiencies out. And we always talk around here about how we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. That's better for our customers, that's better for our employee partners. And all that is contributing. And then lastly, as I mentioned, our supply chain team has done a great job. They are leveraging the opportunities there. The larger we get in that business, the more leverage they have, and they're executing at a high level. And -- so many inputs that are contributing to it, and -- but the -- what's really encouraging is, we see those having an opportunity to continue in the future. So certainly, no event is more of a process.Shlomo H. RosenbaumAnd then just the labor environment on your own, like for the people that you're sourcing?Todd M. SchneiderYes. Pardon me. So from a labor standpoint, yes. As I mentioned earlier, it is easier, but not easy. And we are looking for great people. We want to hire not only people that are employed somewhere else, but happily employed, which is very challenging. And -- but we think we have a great employee value proposition as well. And so we're highly focused on that. So -- but yes, easier than it was a year ago. But Shlomo, throughout my career, it's always been challenging. It's a little bit more challenging than it has been historically, but not what it once was a year ago or so.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.Kartik MehtaI know there's a lot of questions and maybe thoughts on what happens to new sales. And I'm wondering, if you go back to kind of 2008, 2009 and hopefully never have that recession again. But if you look at new sales back then, how did Cintas perform for new sales? And any lessons from that you would take as we move forward?Todd M. SchneiderYes, Kartik. First of all, we're a really different company today than we were in 2008, 2009. We have a much more diversified customer base. We're now -- today 70% of our customers are service is providing, 30% are goods producing. We have significant verticals that we didn't have as well, health care, education, government. So we think we're really well positioned for whenever the next recession is. And I remember '08, '09 because I was running the sales organization back then. And our value propositions still resonated with people, and we still sold new business. And we did so at attractive rates.As I mentioned, it's not always are we asking for new money. Sometimes it's just a redirection of those from somewhere else to us, not only in a -- maybe a direct competitor standpoint, but also they're purchasing clothing, they're purchasing items to take care of the facilities. So we think we're well positioned.I might also mention, you didn't ask specifically about it, but we love having a pristine balance sheet. And we think whenever the next recession is that might open up opportunities for us. And just the fact that we've -- our organization is focused on fighting through whatever the economic environment is, taking great care of our customers, taking great care of our employee partners. And we've grown sales in 52 of the last 54 years. And we suspect that whatever the economic environment is, we believe we're going to be successful in it.J. Michael HansenKartik, I might add, Todd might be a little modest. He was running that organization. It was a difficult environment, and he and the sales team exceeded their internal goals and really continued to show that value even in tough times, as Todd mentioned. And as he also talked about, our customer base is quite a bit broader than it was back then, and our sales team is a little bit different. But the really good news is even back then, in the deepest, longest, broadest recession we'd seen in 100 years, we still sold a lot of new business. And it's a nice reflection of the value proposition that we have.Kartik MehtaYes. And just as a follow-up, if you look at the First Aid and Safety business, you're doing really well in it. Is there a way you would look at to say a certain percentage is recurring? Do you consider a certain percentage recurring? I know you don't have long-term contracts in that business. But just from a demand standpoint and what you've seen from a historical standpoint?Todd M. SchneiderYes, Kartik, it's a good question. I don't have that in front of me, but I know it's -- it has returned much closer to historical or even higher as far as what we see from a repeat -- recurring type of revenue. And we want to provide value to the customers, whatever product services they want. It's just the nature of it, what we provide, whether it be First Aid supplies, access to AEDs, access to eyewash stations, access to clean water through our WaterBreak offering. Those are all items that are really important to our customers more so today than they were pre-pandemic, and we think that, that trend will continue.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanSo one of your competitors has been talking about using a strategy where they're incentivizing their drivers to cross-sell products. Can you talk about why you don't use that strategy? What the disadvantages are that you have found when doing that?Todd M. SchneiderYes. Great question, Toni. I'm glad you asked because my first job 34 years ago was on the trucks. And we have been cross-selling our products via our -- we call them our service sales representatives. We've been cross-selling them since I started, and I'm sure it was in place well before I started as well. So we see -- the fact that we have 12,000 or so trucks that roll out of our parking lots every single day that are focused on taking great care of our customers, when they roll out of those parking lots, they're spending time in those businesses. And they have eyes. They have ears, they have minds, and they see what's going on in those businesses, and they see opportunities. And it always has been and always will be a key component of our growth trajectory because we see that infrastructure as a real advantage. And we leverage it and make sure that those service providers, either they provide more products and services or they provide a lead to provide more products and services based upon the nature of the product that the customer might be interested in.J. Michael HansenAnd Toni, we've talked a lot about this over the last -- more than 10 years, we've got customers of all different sizes, verticals, et cetera. And so while we do certainly expect those service sales reps to continue to penetrate and sell, we recognize that some businesses are just more complex than others, are larger than others. And so sometimes, there's a strategy to enhance that opportunity. And it might be through, for example, in health care. We have dedicated people that really do reach out to the decision makers. So it's not just the service sales rep, but it's also other people that have relationship responsibilities that are looking for those new and different penetration opportunities. It's not as simple just to simply say we're going to go in and have a service sales rep or an SSR go into each customer and sell it, all customers are so different. And so we need a strategy that can attack all types of customers, and we do.Todd M. SchneiderToni, we know that our customer satisfaction scores are really good. And in large part because they really like our people. They like our service providers, our frontline service providers. And we leverage that. And whether it be, as Mike mentioned, a more -- a smaller type customer, we can cross-sell via the service provider. A larger one that's a little bit more complicated. There might be a need for some air cover, for some help there. But nevertheless, that's always been an important component of our strategy and always will be.Toni Michele KaplanThat is super helpful. I wanted to also ask, I think the last few calls, you've been talking more about technology and investments and things of this sort. Are there any, I guess, technology capabilities that you think you still need? Will -- that you either are getting through hiring technology people or maybe even doing M&amp;A?Like -- and maybe you've done it, maybe you still have yet to do, but are there any technology capabilities that you need that basically would be helped through M&amp;A or hiring internally new technology people?Todd M. SchneiderYes, Toni, great question. So we are always on the lookout for those opportunities. We think we have a really strong technology platform that we can build off of. But we know that the answer for what our customers are interested in is with spending time with our customers, and our employee partners are the ones who discern those opportunities. So we're always asking now, how do we make it easier to do business, what -- is there any void? And frankly, that's where most of our investments have come from, that information, been trying to make it easier to do business with us. So we're always in search of trying to be a world-class service provider, but having an incredibly strong technology platform that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us, that makes it easier for our employee partners, our service providers to create a world-class experience for those customers.So yes, we're in search of whether it's -- we buy it or we bolt it on to our current platform or we created ourselves, all of those are of interest to us, and we'll be moving forward.OperatorAt this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley for closing remarks.Jared S. MattingleyThank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

This might be especially true when it comes to the store’s own brands.See: 10 Walmart Brand Grocery Items That Are Now Cheaper at AldiLearn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesWhile these items typically have appealing price tags when compared to their name-brand counterparts, the level of quality might be disappointing. For example, they might be less durable, of lower performance or just not taste quite right. In other words, they end up being a waste of money.From kitchen appliances to snack foods, here are nine Walmart brand products to avoid buying.Kitchen AppliancesIt can be tempting to save $15-$30 or more on kitchen appliances, but not if they stop working in way less than a year.“Unless you’re literally planning on using a kitchen appliance only a few times, skip the Walmart brand,” said David Bakke at DollarSanity. “The quality just isn’t there. I bought a microwave oven from them a few months back and it didn’t even last a month. I’ve had better success with kitchen appliances at Costco, and the prices are competitive.”Glasses and DishwareIf you’re looking for glasses and dishes for the long haul, Walmart brand items might not be the best choice.“All you need to do is basically look at a set of dishes or drinking glasses and realize that the quality isn’t that good,” Bakke said. “Since these sorts of items are ones you normally want to last for years, you’re better off going another route and paying a little more for more durability.”I Stopped Shopping at Dollar Tree: Here’s WhyCerealSaving a dollar or so each time you buy cereal might seem like a smart move, but not if the box sits in the pantry because no one’s eating it.“There are Great Value versions of classic cereals like Apple Jacks and Cocoa Puffs, but the taste isn’t even close,” Bakke said. “If you’re like me, it’s not worth it to save a few pennies when you can’t taste what you’ve known and loved since you were a kid.”Story continuesEquate Beauty ProductsJasmine Charbonier at Your Tampa Bestie recommends avoiding the following Equate Beauty Products based on her personal experience. She said the Walmart-brand makeup remover pads caused irritation and stinging to her skin. She also has tried the big-box retailer’s shampoos and conditioners and said they made her hair dry and frizzy. As for the Walmart-brand skin creams, Charbonier found that they had an overly chemical smell and feel, which made them unpleasant to use.Mainstays FurnitureAccording to Charbonier, Walmart’s Mainstays furniture products are not worth the money. She said the dining chairs she purchased wobbled and became loose over time and the coffee table scratched and dented easily. Additionally, she said the dresser she purchased had drawers that didn’t slide smoothly and jammed, making it frustrating to use.Great Value Frozen PizzaBefore reaching for Great Value frozen pizza on your next Walmart shopping trip, learn from Charbonier’s experience. She said that the sauce is watery and flavorless and the cheese tastes rubbery and artificial. If that’s not enough, she also noted that the crust is soggy in the middle and doesn’t crisp up. She recommends opting for DiGiorno or Red Baron, which provide better taste and value in her opinion.Great Value Snack FoodsCharbonier said that some of the Great Value snack foods leave a lot to be desired. She said the pretzels she’s tried are tiny and often broken into pieces and the potato chips are greasy and have “off” flavors. She also said that the Great Value Cheese Crackers are meant to be like name-brand Cheez-It crackers, but the Walmart version has a waxy texture and doesn’t taste like real cheese.Great Value Frozen Broccoli“You would think that a frozen vegetable would be hard to mess up, but Great Value does a fantastic job of it,” said Tabitha Bailar, founder of Travel Compositions. “Its broccoli, when heated up, is the mushiest mess that it’s hardly recognizable as broccoli anymore.”She added, “I understand that freezing broccoli breaks down the integrity of the vegetable. But most brands flash freeze so that there’s still a little bit of a crunch left when cooked. Not Great Value. It comes out like it was boiled to oblivion, then frozen. There’s just no structure to the vegetable anymore.”Great Value Dill Pickles“The other product I won’t purchase again is Great Value dill pickles,” said Bailar.“I am not too picky when it comes to pickle brands. If it’s vinegary, salty and dilly, I’m a happy camper. Heck, I even drink pickle juice straight from the jar after the spears are gone. However, I couldn’t even finish the jar of Great Value pickles. There was some sort of metal taste and weird aftertaste that was hard to pinpoint. It made me want to gag and I had to throw it out. I’m going to stick with safe Vlasic from now on.”More From GOBankingRates65 Splurges of the Filthy RichHow To Get Free Money: 13 Proven Ways3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00010 Smartest Ways to Make Your Money Work for You, According to ExpertsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 9 Walmart Brand Products To Avoid Buying]"

Let’s take a closer look at each.DaVitaDaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the U.S. to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with expectations creeping higher across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company sports a solid growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 10% on 2% higher revenues in its current year. Peeking ahead, estimates for FY24 allude to a further 6% earnings boost paired with a 2.5% sales bump.And DaVita plans to extend its footprint, providing further runways for growth. The company has been steadily expanding in international markets and expects to expand in major European and Asian countries through acquisitions and partnerships.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company posted a big beat in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 25% and delivering a 2% sales surprise. In fact, the company has beaten consensus EPS expectations by an average of 21% across its last four releases.Walmart Many are familiar with the titan Walmart, with its product portfolio covering nearly every aspect of retail and being known for relatively low prices. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across all timeframes, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncome-focused investors could be attracted to WMT shares, currently yielding a respectable 1.4% annually. And the company has shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, with the payout growing a modest 2% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company recently upped its FY24 guidance following robust quarterly results, with strong sales growth and continued business momentum providing solid tailwinds.AflacAflac, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. The company has seen modest positive earnings estimate revisions among all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike DVA, Aflac has consistently posted bottom line results above expectations, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 8% across its last four releases. Just in its latest print, Aflac posted an 11% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 15% above the consensus.In addition, the company is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrats group, reflecting its commitment to shareholders through a minimum of 25+ years of increased payouts. AFL shares currently yield a solid 2.2%, with a payout ratio sitting sustainably at 30% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd shares aren’t valuation stretched given its forecasted growth, with earnings forecasted to climb 13% in its current year. Shares presently trade at a 12.8X forward earnings multiple, a few ticks above the five-year median but nicely below highs of 13.8X in 2022.Bottom LineAdding low-beta stocks can be a great way to counter volatility, as these stocks are less sensitive to the market’s overall movements. And with volatility creeping higher as of late, investors could be looking for a shield.For those interested in a more conservative approach, all three low-beta stocks above – DaVita DVA, Walmart WMT, and Aflac AFL – could be solid considerations.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting optimism among analysts.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Forrester Research Retail Analyst Sucharita Kodali joins Yahoo Finance Live to react to Costco's fourth-quarter earnings report and how it compares to the consumer narratives playing out in the larger retail space.""Costco's business does tend to be fairly recession-proof, similar to other mass merchants like Walmart, in large part because when a consumer may have lower expectations for the future, they're going to fly to value,"" Kodali says. ""Costco absolutely offers that.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Let's start with Costco results because they had strong grocery sales but weaker trends in some of those discretionary items. What does this tell us just about the state of the consumer at this point heading into that very important holiday season?SUCHARITA KODALI: Yeah, well, I mean, it's a pretty consistent story through all of retail. You have the groceries doing particularly well, in large part because these are the items that-- Food, in general, food, both at home and away from home, has done incredibly well in the last couple of years. It's been one of the beneficiaries in spite of waning consumer confidence and inflation numbers, so that's not surprising.The discretionary piece is also not surprising. It's the same story that we heard with Target. Walmart said the same thing in its last earnings call. And you see it in the overall consumer spend numbers that the census releases on a monthly basis, which is categories ranging from apparel to electronics, which are absolutely categories that Costco carries which just haven't done as well.Home, as well, is one that's particularly soft in the last year and-- and Costco, as far as discretionary is concerned, has historically sold a lot of things like firepits and patio furniture. So there's no doubt that those are categories that are challenged, and you're not seeing the strength, even at Costco, in those sectors.Story continues- The expectations index, as we kind of look at some of the Conference Board data that had come out, showed that consumer short-term outlook for income, business, labor markets, it declined, and expectations falling below 80, a level that historically signals a recession in the next year. If we were to see that, how would that dovetail into the number of consumers that are either signing up as members in Costco or leaning into some of the broader, kind of buying-in-bulk patterns of spending?SUCHARITA KODALI: Yeah, what is important about Costco's business is that it does tend to be fairly recession-proof, similar to other mass merchants like Walmart, in large part because when a consumer may have lower expectations for the future, they're going to fly to value, and Costco absolutely offers that. We've known that, historically, most-- their profit, for the most part, their net income is their-- is very correlated to their membership fees. They're not really making that much money off of the sale of the physical goods themselves, and that very much is about passing value onto shoppers. It is very much about providing the best value and the best product assortment that you can for the consumer.I mean, Costco has been incredibly well-managed as a company pretty much since its inception. I mean, 10 years ago, it was a $100-billion retailer. Now it's $200 billion.I know that its stock today may be taking a mild hit. But when you also step back and look at its performance over time, its stock price is at nearly its high. Its highest was, I think, last spring in 2022. It's comping that, and it is very comparable to the overall NASDAQ index. So it's actually-- overall, when you step back and look at the macro, and you look back at the bigger picture, it's actually doing very, very well. It's held up in spite of some of these issues related to consumer confidence and the fact that people are pulling back from discretionary.]"

This increase in earnings can be attributed to a combination of factors, including strong sales growth, higher membership fee income, improved gross margins and efficient operations.Total revenues, comprising net sales and membership fees, reached $78,939 million, marking a 9.5% increase from the prior-year quarter. This figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $78,563 million.In the fourth quarter, Costco's comparable e-commerce sales declined 0.8% year over year, representing an improvement compared to the 10% decline witnessed in the third quarter.

The United States, Canada and Other International locations registered comparable sales growth of 3.1%, 7.4% and 4.4%, respectively.Costco's gross margin expanded 42 basis points to 10.6%, faring better than our expectation of 30 basis-point expansion.

Meanwhile, the operating margin (as a percentage of total revenues) remained unchanged at 3.5%.Story continuesStore UpdateCostco currently operates 861 warehouses.

WMT and The Kroger Co. KR.Industry: SupermarketsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2155281/2-supermarket-stocks-to-watch-on-robust-industry-trendsPlayers in the Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry have been benefiting from their constant efforts to improve store and online operations. Companies are committed to improving delivery and payment options and strengthening assortments. That said, increased technological investments and high supply-chain costs threaten margins.However, store traffic growth, online demand and efforts to boost omnichannel operations bode well for industry participants. Walmart Inc. and The Kroger Co. are a couple of players that look well positioned on the prevalent opportunities.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry includes supermarket retailers that offer grocery, health and beauty aids, household chemicals, electronics, stationery, automotive accessories, hardware and paint, sporting goods, fabrics and crafts, entertainment products, home furnishings and much more. Players in this industry operate through various formats such as supermarkets, multi-department stores, retail stores, discount stores, supercenters, hypermarkets and warehouse clubs. Food retail accounts for a chunk of their business.The industry has undergone a significant transformation over the years, with e-commerce playing a strong role. Given consumers' rising preference for online shopping, industry participants have enhanced pickup and delivery services and are offering easy payment options.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Supermarkets IndustrySolid Omnichannel Efforts: Supermarket retailers have left no stone unturned to strengthen operations – both online and online. Companies have been benefiting from their focus on store improvisation, merchandise enhancement, prudent pricing strategy and efforts to replenish assortments. Also, industry players have been pushing the edge out of the envelope to bolster online operations.Story continuesThe increase in popularity of online shopping, particularly after the pandemic, propelled companies to constantly ramp up efforts in this arena through acquisitions, partnerships and improved delivery and payment systems. In this regard, companies have been benefiting from their same-day delivery, buy online and pick-up in-store, curbside pickup and contactless payment options. Companies' concerted efforts to unite store and online operations to offer customers a solid omnichannel experience certainly keep them well-placed for growth.Also, with digitization, several supermarket players have gained detailed insight into their operational performance, demand cycles, supply-chain issues, and delivery status. This has been improving their competitiveness in the market with higher operational productivity, product quality and lower costs.Favorable Demand Aids: Supermarket companies benefit from favorable demand for essentials, as at-home consumption remains elevated. Per the report published by the Commerce Department on Sep 14, U.S. retail sales grew 0.6% in August after increasing 0.5% in July. August retail sales increased 1.6% from the year-ago period's levels. The rise of retail sales indicates a favorable demand in the industry despite the presence of inflationary pressures.Solid demand for staple products, especially groceries, medicines and cleaning supplies, supported by strong dine-at-home and work-from-home practices, has driven the industry. These demand trends are likely to persist in the near term, as many Americans prefer to work and cook at home. This calls for supermarket players to continue investing in innovative offerings and merchandising to make the most of such trends.Rising Costs Hurt Margins: The industry is dealing with margin pressure due to inflation in raw materials and other expenses, hurting profitability. This apart, companies' constant technological investments to bolster online operations, elevated supply chain and wage expenses threaten margins and profitability. Continued price investments and other promotion activities also come at the cost of margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

Those higher rates are driving increased delinquencies (see BofA charts below) and could potentially lead to more charge-offs on department store credit cards soon.""We expect KSS and JWN will see a decline in credit revenue in the coming quarters as rising delinquencies turn into charge-offs,"" BofA analyst Lorraine Hutchinson said in the note to clients.Read more: How does the Fed affect your credit card interest rate?Credit losses are on the rise. (BofA) (BofA)Consumers are having trouble paying off their credit cards. (BofA) (BofA)Store credit cards — with interest rates in some cases above 30% — have long been a pure profit center for department stores.Credit card sales made up about 87% of operating profits at high-end department store Nordstrom in 2022, according to experts. In 2021, that number was 79%.Meanwhile, credit card sales generated the majority of operating profits at Kohl's in 2022, pros estimated.BofA's Hutchinson now sees fair value for Nordstrom stock at $13, down from $14 previously. Kohl's stock is being valued at $22 a share by Hutchinson, down from $25.Hutchinson added she expects a ""worsening credit cycle"" in coming quarters.The negative narrative around department store stocks, in large part due to credit cycle worries, took center stage during the second quarter reporting season in August.Macy's (M) said its second quarter credit card sales tanked 36% from the prior year to $150 million. The reason: Excess balances on Macy's Citibank-powered credit cards were met with a rising interest rate environment.Cash-strapped consumers — enduring an almost 25% annual percentage interest rate on the Macy's card — haven't been able to pay off their bills. Macy's has opted to write off those balances and could keep doing so in the quarters ahead.Story continues""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with Wall Street at the time.

57,584ffeec-c834-3130-ac54-35038bc034c4,JWN,2023-09-28,Beware! 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Waving Massive Red Flags Right Now.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beware-7-blue-chip-stocks-180514852.html,1695233114,STORY,"['NFLX', 'GPS', 'CMCSA', 'JWN', 'WHR', 'DAL', 'BKNG', 'HD']","[Sometimes, even blue-chip stocks can generate substantial losses. Disney (NYSE:DIS), for example, plummeted as consumers ditched cable television. Top retail stocks took a hit as they lost market share to online competitors. Others, like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pulled back because valuations became far too rich. Whatever the case may be, it’s important to stay on top of your blue-chip investments, especially if they’re waving massive red flags. In fact, here are seven more examples of top blue-chip stocks to sell.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Booking Holdings (BKNG)a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphoneSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comThere are signs the leisure travel boom is at its end, which is a negative for Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), America’s largest online travel agency. For example, Wyndham Hotel (NYSE:WH) recently noted that in late July, growth in the demand for its hotels had dropped in the U.S. last quarter, while its profits had fallen. In addition, as I noted in a previous column, “two discount airlines: Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and Frontier recently warned that Q3 revenues were trending below their previous expectations.Insiders have also been selling stock recently. But that’ll happen when a stock reaches stellar heights, as BKNG has done. CEO Glenn Fogel, for example, sold about $2.4 million worth of stock. Chief Financial Officer David Goulden also sold about $1.8 million worth of stock. Also, unlike many names in the travel space, BKNG stock is not trading at a low valuation. In fact, it trades at 19x forward earnings, which isn’t too far from where the S&amp;P 500 trades.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDelta Airlines (DAL)a Delta (DAL) plane flying through the cloudsSource: NextNewMedia / Shutterstock.comDelta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) has apparently been dragged down by the travel slowdown, and higher oil prices. The latter, of course, will increase the firm’s costs and lower its profits.Story continuesGiven these points, it’s not surprising that the airline recently cut its third-quarter earnings per share guidance to $1.83 to $2.05 from $2.20 to $2.50. In addition, DAL now expects its revenue per available seat mile to fall 2% to 3% year-over-year this quarter. Although the company reiterated its full-year earnings per share guidance of $6 to $7, I believe that this outlook could very well be too optimistic at this point. At a minimum, its EPS is likely to come in towards the low end of the range.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Comcast (CMCSA)Keeping NBC News on the Air Could Hamper Comcast StockSource: ShutterstockAt first glance, Comcast’s (NYSE:CMCSA) second-quarter results appear okay. For example, its top line climbed 1.6% year over year. Meanwhile, net income,  advanced 4.8% year over year. Most of those increases were reportedly driven by the reopening of company theme parks.Unfortunately, Comcast’s other, steadier businesses delivered rather discouraging results. Most worrisome for CMCSA stock was the 0.4% YOY decline in the revenue of its Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and the net loss by that business of 65,000 of its customers last quarter. That unit encompasses the firm’s broadband internet and cable TV offerings.In addition, competition from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and other telecom companies is starting to meaningfully erode Comcast’s broadband Internet unit. All while its cable TV business continues to lose customers. Also, the revenue of its media business was little changed year over year. We also have to consider that consumer cord-cutting won’t exactly help the stock moving forward either.Home Depot (HD)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukAs I pointed out in a previous column, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is being hurt by a low number of homes being sold due to the current, elevated interest rates.  Indeed, last quarter, HD’s comparable sales sank 2% year over year, while its operating income tumbled a rather discouraging 8.6%. I don’t see much improvement in the foreseeable future, especially with seasonally adjusted housing starts down 11.3% in August, year over year.While I do expect the Fed to cut interest rates early next year, it will likely take until the middle or end of next year for home starts and home sales to rebound meaningfully. By that time, HD stock is likely to have fallen a great deal.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Gap (GPS)Source: ShutterstockSome may quarrel with my inclusion of Gap (NYSE:GPS) on a list of blue-chip stocks. But the company’s Gap and Old Navy stores are quite ubiquitous in the U.S., making the country a top brick-and-mortar realtor. As a result, I think that GPS does qualify as a blue-chip stock. Last quarter, the company’s comparable sales tumbled 6% year over year. Online sales sank 11%. In addition, GPS reported that  Old Navy, which used to be a pillar of strength for the firm, suffered “a comparable sales drop of 6%.” Gap also expects its revenue to dive at least 10% during the current quarter.Clearly, the company’s offerings are just not resonating with consumers, and/or it’s being eaten alive by its competition. GPS has to figure out how to turn its business around. And until it does so, GPS is clearly one of the blue-chip stocks to sell now.Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLike Gap, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is one of America’s top apparel retailers. Unfortunately for JWN and its peers, analysts, on average, expect U.S. apparel sales to climb only 1% during the upcoming holiday season.Nordstrom’s sales tumbled 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Excluding the closure of its Canadian operations and the timing of a key sale, its revenue would have declined “only” 4% year-over-year, the firm reported. Still, the retailer expects its revenue to sink 4% to 6% year-over-year in Q3, showing that its performance is not likely to improve anytime soon. Also noteworthy is that its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped to $192 million from %$202 million in Q2 of 2022.As with Gap, Nordstrom appears to be losing a significant amount of market share and has to find a way to turn itself around.Whirlpool (WHR)Source: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.comClearly, appliance maker Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) is, like Home Depot, being badly hurt by the low number of home sales. Whirlpool is, of course, being hurt by the trend because people who move into new homes often buy new appliances for them, while builders add new appliances to the houses that they’ve created.Whirlpool’s top line sank 6% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while its operations burned $370 million of cash, nearly the $180 million that its operations used during the same period a year earlier.Until home sales show signs of starting to recover meaningfully, WHR stock is unlikely to advance much and could very well drop a great deal. Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the section on HD, I don’t expect home sales to start recovering until the middle of 2024 at the earliest.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG acquired Hartley Cylke Pacific Insurance Services, Inc. The buyout will help AJG consolidate its presence in the transportation market across California and Arizona.San Diego, CA-based Hartley Cylke Pacific Insurance Services is a retail insurance broker with expertise in transportation coverage. It serves its clients across California and Arizona. The addition of Hartley Cylke Pacific will thus boost the acquirer’s capabilities in the aforesaid operating region.Arthur J. Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with buyouts made in the Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker acquired 25 entities in the first half of 2023 that contributed about $418 million to estimated annualized revenues and 12 more in the quarter to date.AJG has a solid merger and acquisition pipeline with about 55 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared, representing more than $700 million of annualized revenues. Revenue growth rates will generally range from 5% to 20% for 2023 acquisitions.A solid capital position supports the insurer in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions. AJG continues to expect M&amp;A capacity upward of $3 billion through the end of 2023 and another $3 billion in 2024 without using any equity.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker’s long-term growth strategies should help it deliver organic revenue improvement and pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. AJG is focused on productivity improvements and quality enhancements that should help it post sturdy numbers in the future.  Shares of Arthur J. Gallagher have gained 23.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 14.3% growth. Solid performance of the Brokerage and Risk Management segments, strategic buyouts to capitalize on growing market opportunities and effective capital deployment should continue to drive the share price higher.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the insurance industry’s adequate capital level, players like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. Recently, Marsh, its business unit, inked a deal to purchase the entire outstanding share capital of the Australia-based specialist insurance broker Honan Insurance Group Pty Ltd. Management of Marsh believes that the inclusion of Honan’s well-established capabilities, specifically in the field of corporate risk and strata insurance, will enhance its specialist competence. This, in turn, will enable Marsh to better serve its client base across Australia and New Zealand.Acquisitions form one of the core growth strategies of Marsh &amp; McLennan. Buyouts, similar to the latest one, add strength to its capabilities, expand its services offerings and enable the company to enter new geographies as well as solidify its foothold across existing markets. An upgraded services suite is likely to lure more customers and contribute more to the revenues of MMC in the days ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Erie Indemnity Company ERIE and Ryan Specialty Holdings Inc. RYAN.Erie Indemnity outpaced earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average surprise being 2.05%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ERIE’s 2023 earnings and revenues suggests a rise of 32.9% and 16.7%, respectively, from the prior-year reported figures. The consensus mark for ERIE’s 2023 and 2024 earnings has moved 5.4% and 8.6% north, respectively, in the past 60 days. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

AAN has opened its latest GenNext store in Fort Smith, AK. This move will help expand the company's GenNext store initiative and offer better in-store customer experience. Store timings are from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.The GenNext initiative was originally launched in 2018 and has received positive customer feedback since then. The initiative includes new and remodeled stores. To date, Aaron's has converted or opened 32 GenNext stores, bringing the total to 243.These stores come with re-engineered store layouts, updated signage, expanded product assortment, enhanced technology-enabled checkout and an innovative operating model.What’s More?This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been gaining from cost-reduction initiatives and a solid online show. It continued to witness strength in its e-commerce platform. In second-quarter 2023, e-commerce lease revenues rose 5.5%, accounting for 17.9% of the total lease revenues. The uptick can be attributable to increased website traffic and a higher conversion rate.Some other notable efforts include increased investments in digital marketing, improved shopping experience, same-day and next-day delivery services, the personalization of products, and a broader assortment, including the latest product categories. Its express delivery program also bodes well.The company’s latest acquisition of appliance and electronics retailer, BrandsMart, enabled AAN to offer high-quality furniture, appliances, electronics, and other home goods on affordable lease and retail purchase options to its customers. In second-quarter 2022, Aaron’s included BrandsMart revenues for the first time since its buyout.For the BrandsMart segment, revenues were $143.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, driven by strength in small appliances and housewares, and e-commerce. The company is optimistic about the segment’s performance in the near term. The buyout is likely to strengthen Aaron’s market position and help expand the customer base.However, weak lease revenues and fees, and drab retail sales at both Aaron's and BrandsMart businesses are headwinds. This led to a consolidated revenue decline of 13.1% in the second quarter.Also, continued inflationary and other economic pressures affecting customers' payment activity act as deterrents. Both segments are expected to continue experiencing softness in customer demand in its core product categories, including appliances, furniture and electronics, in the second half of the year.Consequently, management anticipates 2023 revenues of $2.12-$2.22 billion compared with the earlier stated $2.15-$2.25 billion. The lowered revenue outlook is mainly due to lower early purchased options and drab retail sales at the Aaron's business in the second quarter, which is likely to continue throughout the year.For 2023, adjusted EBITDA (excluding stock-based compensation) is likely to be $140-$160 million. The company expects earnings per share of 55-80 cents compared with the earlier stated 70-95 cents. For the BrandsMart business, revenues are anticipated to be $615-$645 million, lower than the $645-$675 million stated previously.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research As a result, AAN shares fell 25.9% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 9%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean RCL and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The same day the Culinary Workers Union vote took place, President Joe Biden joined United Auto Workers strikers on a picket line in Michigan.Earlier this year, UPS reached a new deal before a work stoppage that could have significantly disrupted the nation’s supply chain.Workers calling for higher wages, better conditions and job security, especially since the end of the pandemic, have been increasingly willing to walk out on the job as employers face a greater need for workers.In Nevada, the Culinary Union is the largest labor union, representing about 60,000 hospitality workers statewide. Contracts for 40,000 of those members recently expired.“We are the glue that keeps these hotels together, and we should be paid what we deserve,” Deanna Virgil, a longtime employee at Wynn Las Vegas, told The Associated Press after casting her vote.Virgil was among 53,000 housekeepers, cocktail and food servers, porters, cooks, bartenders and other hotel employees in Las Vegas eligible to participate in the vote. The union is scheduled to return to the bargaining table next week with MGM Resorts, Caesars and Wynn Resorts.In a statement Tuesday night, MGM Resorts said it has a decades-long history of successfully bargaining with the union and believes that “both parties are committed to negotiating a contract that is good for everyone.”Story continuesCaesars did not respond to emailed requests for comment, and Wynn Resorts said they had no comment.Virgil, who has worked in the hospitality sector for 38 years, said she is able to make do with her current salary and benefits because she lives with her adult daughter.“There’s no telling where I would be if I didn’t have the support of my daughter,” Virgil said. “There are a lot of us who have two jobs, but one job should be enough.”Bethany Khan, the union’s spokesperson, said all members receive health insurance and currently earn about $26 hourly, including benefits. Khan declined to say how much the union is seeking in pay raises because “we do not negotiate in public,” although the union has said it is asking for “the largest wage increases ever negotiated” in its history.In 1991, more than 500 workers went on strike at the now-shuttered Frontier hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas. It became one of the longest strikes in U.S. history, stretching more than six years. The union said all the strikers returned to their jobs afterward, with back pay and benefits.The union last voted to authorize a strike in 2018. Five-year contracts were reached soon after a majority of the participating 25,000 hospitality workers cast votes to walk off the job. Rory Kuykendall, 40, said he is hopeful that Tuesday’s vote will have the same effect.“It’s great to see all the huge numbers in turnout,” said Kuykendall, a bellperson at Flamingo Las Vegas. “It’s a chance for all the members to come out and show that we’re really ready to fight.”Last summer, the casino workers’ union in Atlantic City negotiated landmark contracts that gave workers the biggest raises they’ve ever had. It also removed any chance of a strike for several years, an important consideration for Atlantic City’s casino industry as it tries to return to pre-pandemic business levels.In past contracts, the Atlantic City union had concentrated on preserving health care and pension benefits, but this time sought “significant” pay raises for workers to help them keep pace with spiraling prices for gasoline, food, rent and other living expenses, the union said.]"

The firm upgraded shares of the online gambling operator from Neutral to Overweight. It also boosted its price target from $26 to $37 as it believes DraftKings stock has lagged too far behind the S&amp;P 500 Index (^SPX) since July.Shares of DraftKings were up more than 4% at the market open on Tuesday.""We are taking advantage of sluggish share price performance since late July given what we continue to think is an appealing sector, with attractive same-store and new market growth prospects, against the backdrop of an industry-wide improving operating expense control environment (in part due to an increasingly smaller percentage of revenues coming from newer markets, which have meaningful new user acquisition costs and up-front investment),"" JPMorgan analyst Joseph Greff wrote.DraftKings shares soared more than 175% on the year into July as Wall Street grew more bullish on the mobile sports operator amid market share gains. JPMorgan analysis shows that DraftKings increased its gross gaming revenue market share from 28% in the first quarter to 32% in the second quarter. In the second quarter of last year, the operator owned just 20% of gross gaming revenue market share, per JPMorgan.DraftKings hold rates, the percentage of money the company keeps out of the total amount bet by customers, have increased as the company increases its accuracy on odds making and customers move to more profitable betting options. This, JPMorgan argues, will continue as the legalized sports gambling market grows.""Customer acquisition costs can continue declining as national scale is achieved and sales/marketing costs fall precipitously,"" Greff wrote.The DraftKings logo is displayed at the sports betting company headquarters, Thursday, May 2, 2019, in Boston.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.23, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a hidden gem or a value trap?Decoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany Profile: Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH)Norwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 60,000), operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 19,000 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's historical data, 2021: -0.13; 2022: -0.33; 2023: -0.38, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 28.67; 2020: 21.68; 2021: 0.08; 2022: 5.74; 2023: 16.54; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-32%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionGiven the declining revenue and earnings, coupled with a low Altman Z-score, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings appears to be a potential value trap. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, the underlying financial distress signals caution. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision. As always, a well-informed decision is the best decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Market windows are shrinking, the costs and risks of new designs are rising, thermal constraints and reliability are twin priorities and the need for cradle-to-grave security continues to grow. Satisfying these simultaneous demands requires immediate knowledge of special technology and vertical-market expertise. There’s no time to start from scratch. Today, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) adds nine new technology- and application-specific solution stacks to its growing collection of mid-range FPGA and System-on-Chip (SoC) support. The stacks span the industrial edge, smart embedded vision and edge communications.“We’re making it much easier to create industry-leading industrial and communications designs,” said Shakeel Peera, vice president of strategy for Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “And our intelligent edge focus is getting significant traction with leading system designers because they get the full benefit of PolarFire FPGA’s unequalled power efficiency, security and reliability.”“Size, weight and power are extremely important considerations in designing a thermal imaging system,” said Federic Aubrun, CCO of Xenics, a pioneer in infrared imaging, with best-in-class products for short-, mid- and long-wave IR imagers, cores and cameras. “Microchip SmartFusion® and PolarFire FPGAs provide the best balance between small form factor, power efficiency and processing resources within an extremely low power budget in our current and next-generation products.”“We use PolarFire FPGAs because of their small footprint and energy efficiency,” said Michael Yampolsky, founder and CEO of KAYA Instruments. “They enable our cameras to fit into tight spaces while getting high quality, low noise, excellent dynamic range and large feature set utilizing the latest CMOS sensor technology. Using PolarFire FPGAs on our platform allows us to bring our latest vision technology to market quickly for our customers’ needs.” KAYA designs industrial-grade imaging equipment, including small-form-factor and low-power cameras and frame grabbers that provide outstanding video quality in average to extreme ambient light conditions.Story continuesThe news of Microchip’s expanded solution stack collections follows the June announcement of an industrial edge stack for OPC/UA (Open Platform Communications/Unified Architecture) and extensive resources to help customers switch to PolarFire FPGAs and SoCs.Tailored Solution Stacks—Only for PolarFire FPGAs and SoCsUnlike alternatives that offer baseline support for overly broad application categories, PolarFire FPGA intelligent edge solution stacks are highly tailored to specific technologies and vertical-market requirements and include detailed intellectual property (IP), reference designs, development kits with sample designs, application notes, demo guides and more.Microchip is offering new PolarFire FPGA and SoC intelligent edge solutions and stacks for the following applications:Smart embedded vision:H.264 compressionHDMI®Serial digital interfaceCoaXpress®Industrial edge:Motor controlOPC/UAEdge communications:Software-defined radiosUSXGMIISmall Form-factor Pluggable (SFP+) optical module5G ORANAbout the PolarFire FamilyMicrochip’s PolarFire family offers twice the power efficiency of FPGAs in its category with the highest reliability and military-grade security. These FPGAs are the first—and currently still only—RISC-V SoC FPGAs shipping in production volumes. PolarFire SoC devices create new configurable processing capabilities through hardened RISC-V core complexes in a fast FPGA fabric and they are playing an integral role as computer workloads move to the power-sensitive intelligent edge. Their capabilities will be extended with a roadmap to increased compute capability in ever-smaller and less costly industrial, IoT and other edge-compute products.

The MCUs offer configurable peripherals, advanced communication interfaces and easy connection across multiple voltage domains without external components.With I3C functionality, flexible peripherals and the ability to operate on three independent voltage domains, PIC18-Q20 MCUs are well suited to be used in conjunction with a primary MCU in a larger overall system. This family of MCUs can perform tasks such as processing sensor data, handling low latency interrupts and system status reporting that the main MCU cannot perform as efficiently. While the Central Processing Unit (CPU) runs at a different voltage domain, the I3C peripheral operates from 1.0 to 3.6V. These low-power, small form factor MCUs can be used in a wide range of space-sensitive applications and markets including automotive, industrial control, computing, consumer, IoT and medical.“One of the main barriers to large-scale IoT adoption is the cost of implementing an edge node. With the PIC18-Q20 family of MCUs, Microchip is helping to break down that barrier,” said Greg Robinson, corporate vice president of Microchip’s 8-bit MCU business unit. “By introducing the industry’s first low pin count MCU with I3C we are enabling flexible, cost-effective scaling of IoT applications and embracing the new standard communications interface.”Story continuesAs the market shifts to demand higher performance solutions with lower power and smaller size, I3C helps designers and software developers address these potentially challenging requirements. Compared to I2C, I3C offers higher communication rates and lower power consumption, all while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy systems. The I3C and MVIO functionality, combined with Microchip’s configurable Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs), allow for lower system costs, reduced design complexity and a reduction in board space by replacing external level shifters with on-chip multiple voltage domains.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, MetLife has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Prudential has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that MET has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.MET currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.10, while PUK has a forward P/E of 11.60. We also note that MET has a PEG ratio of 0.62. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PUK currently has a PEG ratio of 1.29.Another notable valuation metric for MET is its P/B ratio of 1.58. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PUK has a P/B of 1.73.Based on these metrics and many more, MET holds a Value grade of A, while PUK has a Value grade of D.Story continuesMET has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PUK, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MET is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is Aegon (AEG). AEG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 7, which compares to its industry's average of 7.97. AEG's Forward P/E has been as high as 115.70 and as low as 5.77, with a median of 10.66, all within the past year.We should also highlight that AEG has a P/B ratio of 1.18. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.42. Over the past 12 months, AEG's P/B has been as high as 1.31 and as low as 0.52, with a median of 0.86.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. AEG has a P/S ratio of 0.65. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.73.Story continuesAnother great Insurance - Multi line stock you could consider is MetLife (MET), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.MetLife is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 7.27 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.56. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 7.97 and average PEG ratio of 0.69.MET's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.27 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 7.40. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 5.74, as low as 0.22, with a median of 0.59.Additionally, MetLife has a P/B ratio of 1.62 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.42. For MET, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.47, as low as 1.16, with a median of 1.61 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Aegon and MetLife strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

At the time, he warned there was a 75% chance of the US experiencing a recession by the end of 2022.His bearish call on the economy contrasts with predictions from some other experts who think the US economy may be able to achieve a ""soft landing,"" thanks to strong spending. This means that the Fed's relentless rate hikes would be able to achieve its goal of taming inflation while not triggering a recession.Story continuesHowever, oil prices have been rising recently and are nearing a key milestone of $100 a barrel, after major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would be extending output cuts.This could complicate efforts by central banks to bring inflation under control, as they may again be looking at further rate hikes — that could, in turn, hit the economy. Energy is a key input for economic activities, so higher oil prices generally lead to inflation.The benchmark US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were up 0.95% at $94.57 a barrel at 11.11 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

Neither of those two factors is likely to abate soon.On the supply side, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ economies need a high enough price for long enough to maximize their short-term profits and diversify their economies away from oil. For Saudi, the diversification drive is already apparent in the inroads it's making in global sports, its positioning as a tourism hub, and its attempt to reinvent cities in projects such as Neom.But neither Saudi nor other OPEC members can readily afford to lose their energy sector entirely, even if the end of oil lies in the distant future. Instead, some are positioning themselves to become major players in renewable energy and carbon capture and storage. But pulling off this transition requires major investments, and high oil prices will help guarantee an orderly transition.On the other side, China and emerging markets like India will continue to demand oil as they grow. China’s current economic weakness, Struyven pointed out, is in non-oil dependent sectors such as real estate and exports. Even at a 4-5% growth rate, which is now expected for 2023 and 2024, China will continue to put an upward pressure on oil prices.Add to that the bumper growth in India—hovering between 6% and 7% this year and next and contributing up to 15% of global growth—and you have the ingredients for high energy prices globally, no matter what happens in the U.S. or other advanced economies.More news below.Peter Vanhampeter.vanham@fortune.com@petervanhamThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

The company has entered a strategic alliance with MUFG, which is expected to bolster its presence in Japan. Moreover, its initiatives to become less dependent on capital markets-driven revenue sources, along with the inorganic growth efforts, will likely keep supporting the top line.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MS’ current-year earnings has been unchanged. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking at its price performance, over the past year, shares of Morgan Stanley have gained 0.9% against the industry’s decline of 0.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research A few other factors mentioned below make Morgan Stanley a solid pick now.Earnings Strength: MS’ earnings have grown at a rate of 11.5% over the past three to five years. While its earnings are projected to decline 8.3% this year, the trend will likely reverse after that. In 2024, the company’s earnings are expected to grow 22.5%.Moreover, Morgan Stanley has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the positive surprise being 4.2%, on average.Revenue Growth: Morgan Stanley’s top-line growth is impressive. Net revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% over the last four years (2018-2022), with the upward trend continuing in the first half of 2023.Given the higher interest rates, decent loan demand, the company’s strategic buyouts, and its focus on the wealth management and investment management segments (that are less dependent on the capital markets and are less volatile revenue sources), its top line is expected to keep improving.In 2023 and 2024, revenues are expected to grow 2.1% and 6.8%, respectively.Balance Sheet Strength: As of Jun 30, 2023, MS had long-term debt of $243.8 billion, with only $22.3 billion expected to mature over the next 12 months. The company’s average liquidity resources were $310.7 billion as of the same date.Moreover, investment-grade long-term credit ratings of A1/ A-/A+ from Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively, as of Jul 31, 2023, and a stable outlook render Morgan Stanley favorable access to the debt market. Thus, the company is expected to be able to meet near-term debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens, given its sufficient liquidity position.Sustainable Capital Distributions: Following the 2023 stress test results, Morgan Stanley increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to 85 cents per share and reauthorized a new multi-year share repurchase program of up to $20 billion, beginning in the third quarter of 2023. Given a solid liquidity position and earnings strength, Morgan Stanley is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital distribution activities in the future.Valuation Favorable: Morgan Stanley’s stock seems to be trading at a discount with respect to its price/book (P/B) and price/earnings (P/E) ratios. Currently, it has a P/B ratio of 1.50, below the industry average of 2.05. Also, its P/E (F1) ratio of 14.25 compares favorably with the industry’s 17.06.Story continuesOther Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Interactive Brokers IBKR and Tradeweb Markets TW.

The findings contain responses from over 400 single family offices, with 77 percent of participant families having a total net worth of over $500 million. Reporting data on 1,728 employees, the trusted data is meant to serve as a reference to help shape all-important staffing decisions and strategy for family office clients.Against today’s competitive talent backdrop, more than half of family offices report recruiting challenges across the board, specifically with accounting, tax, investment and support roles. More than 90 percent of firms report that they gave employees salary increases in the previous 12 months. Salary increases in family offices continue to outpace the broader U.S. market and the use of incentive compensation in family offices remains strong, with bonuses at or above the prior year for 82 percent of staff.""Employers across nearly any industry today can see that the talent and compensation landscape is rapidly evolving. Our research amplifies the importance of having data that breaks down trends through a lens specific to family offices,"" said Valerie Wong Fountain, Head of Family Office Resources Partner and Platform Management at Morgan Stanley. ""Evaluating the factors that make each firm unique and drawing insights on how they impact compensation, this data is meant to empower families and family offices to make informed decisions. With access to benchmarking data, family offices can evaluate their compensation strategies to recruit and retain adept talent, and ultimately drive long-term success for the family.""Story continuesAdditional key findings in the report include:Women comprise nearly one-third of executive roles in family offices, outpacing U.S. corporate data for women in C-suite and leadership roles.The use of Long-Term Incentive (LTI) compensation plans continues to grow, with 59 percent of all respondents reporting using LTI plans. This increases with firm AUM (47 percent of firms with under $1B AUM, 72 percent of firms with over $1B AUM).80 percent of family offices utilize annual incentive and/or bonus plans.While most geographic premiums continue to align with historical trends, some downward shifting of premia has been observed in traditional ""high-cost"" markets.Other markets have experienced increasing competition for talent and compensation premiums resulting from family office relocation or establishment (notably in Florida, Nevada and Wyoming).""We deeply appreciate the amazing responsiveness, with more than 400 families participating in this survey,"" said Trish Botoff, Founder and Managing Principal of Botoff Consulting. ""Our focus remains on expanding the depth and effectiveness of compensation data to empower principals and their teams to assess compensation, to align goals, and to make informed decisions to reward, retain, and motivate family office talent.""Family offices are becoming increasingly professional, strategic and proactive in addressing family needs. They are incorporating more advanced platforms and systems, and now require staff with more sophisticated skill sets. To meet this demand, family offices are recruiting from a steadily widening pool of talent to fill a broad spectrum of leadership and functional positions, as well as growing in-house investment teams.

After two years of virtual drills due to COVID-19, the exercise was held in-person at the company's Holmdel office.""There is no such thing as being overprepared for the curveballs Mother Nature can throw our way,"" said Jim Fakult, president of JCP&amp;L. ""While our crews have had plenty of practice already this year with smaller storm responses, regular emergency drills are another way we work to improve electric service for our customers, in addition to tree trimming and projects that harden our electric infrastructure and enhance its resiliency.""The drill's hypothetical scenario focused on ""Winter Storm April,"" a potent system that dropped more than 2 feet of snow in several areas of JCP&amp;L's service territory over two days. Widespread wind gusts exceeded 50 miles per hour. The drill's severe weather toppled trees and damaged power lines, knocking out electricity to more than 75% of JCP&amp;L's customers. In the exercise, plows could not keep pace with the accumulating snow, leaving numerous roads impassable and slowing crews in their efforts to access damage and make repairs.During the training, JCP&amp;L activated its Incident Command System (ICS). ICS is a nationally recognized and accepted emergency management structure used by all levels of government, as well as by many non-governmental and private sector organizations, such as JCP&amp;L, to improve coordination and collaboration during major storms or other natural disasters.Story continuesAs part of the collaboration with local governments, JCP&amp;L officials have met with representatives of the offices of emergency management in the counties that make up the company's 1.1-milllion customer service area.In the aftermath of a major weather event, JCP&amp;L crews follow a formal restoration process and typically address outages that restore the largest number of customers before moving to more isolated problems. They generally prioritize hospitals and other critical medical facilities, communications facilities and emergency response agencies. After that, crews work to restore power as quickly as possible to the rest of the customers.""Our teams are always at the ready and follow a prescribed process when storms are in the forecast,"" said Fakult.

95,1f815015-8024-3bf3-acc5-702801b92ae9,FE,2023-09-28,Is FirstEnergy Corp.'s (NYSE:FE) 4.8% ROE Worse Than Average?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-corp-nyse-fe-4-123936844.html,1695731976,STORY,['FE'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for FirstEnergy How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for FirstEnergy is:4.8% = US$523m ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.05 in profit.Does FirstEnergy Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, FirstEnergy has a lower ROE than the average (8.3%) in the Electric Utilities industry classification.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for FirstEnergy.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesFirstEnergy's Debt And Its 4.8% ROEFirstEnergy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.19. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

(CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-attracting-investor-130010022.html,1695733210,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -2.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +53.8%. This estimate has changed +11.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.37 indicates a change of +16.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.71 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.75 billion and $38.61 billion estimates indicate +18.5% and +11.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.6 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.93%. The EPS surprise was +11.58%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PG&amp;E is also highlighting the resources, programs and incentives the company offers to help make EV ownership more affordable for all customers.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)Currently, one in seven electric vehicles in the nation plug into PG&amp;E's grid, representing approximately 518,000 EVs with a combined battery storage capacity (6 GW) almost three times more than the Diablo Canyon Power Plant's generation capacity. That battery storage capacity will increase significantly as EV adoption grows in the decades ahead. PG&amp;E is preparing the grid to quickly and safely power at least 3 million EVs by 2030, and is collaborating to pioneer technology that can harness clean energy from solar and wind generation to help power the electric grid and offset a portion of the 70% load growth projected over the next 20 years.""California is still in the early stages of an exciting energy transformation, and EVs are front and center as we reimagine the energy system for the future. Bi-directional charging technology is available today that gives EV owners the ability to power their homes in the event of an outage or to offset energy use. We are collaborating with automakers and some of the world's top innovators to test applications that will enable us to harness the power of EV batteries as a grid resource to support peak electricity demand periods and decarbonize the economy at the lowest societal cost. The technology will also enable EVs to play a big role in offsetting some of the load growth associated with California's path forward to electrification,"" said Jason Glickman, PG&amp;E Executive Vice President, Engineering, Planning &amp; Strategy.Story continuesPG&amp;E is collaborating with BMW of North America, Ford Motor Company and General Motors to test cutting-edge vehicle-grid-integration (VGI) applications, and is executing the nation's first large-scale bidirectional charging pilots which are testing multiple value streams to enable a wide range of services and study the cost-effectiveness of VGI. The bidirectional charging pilots offer upfront and ongoing performance-based incentives and provide higher upfront incentives to help reduce the affordability barrier for underserved communities.""The technology we are building today will play an important role in increasing the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG)-free resources powering the grid by storing clean energy generated during the day to supplement the availability of clean energy during the peak evening demand period and overnight. At some point in the near future, we will have millions of EVs providing power back to the grid to help utilities like ours meet peak electricity demand without the need for non-renewable energy resources,"" said Glickman.Other Ways PG&amp;E is Supporting California's EV FutureIn addition to its VGI work creating a path for EVs to power customer homes and hometowns, PG&amp;E is accelerating equitable EV adoption by:Continued prioritization of grid readiness and building grid capacity to accommodate new EV demand through a multiyear grid investment plan.Rapidly accelerating EV-enabling technology by partnering to explore and scale low-cost grid and infrastructure solutions, second-life battery programs, and other technologies.Partnering with innovators across the entire EV value chain to build the large-scale electric infrastructure needed to incorporate EV charging systems into the grid.PG&amp;E is also deploying cost-efficient, targeted customer programs to accelerate equitable EV adoption with the aim to:Increase access to EV infrastructure, by deploying chargers to support PG&amp;E's customers and setting aside budgets in programs for underserved communities.Reduce the total cost of EV ownership for customers through innovative rate structures, like PG&amp;E's Electric Home Rate Plan for residential customers.Increase EV customer awareness by partnering with community organizations to understand local education needs and tailoring tools and materials to drive EV adoption.Seamlessly integrate EVs with the grid, enabling VGI, EV market participation, and grid support.EV Customer Programs and IncentivesPG&amp;E offers a variety of tools and resources to help educate customers regarding EV ownership. Customers are invited to check out PG&amp;E's EV Savings Calculator, an online resource to browse vehicles, discover incentives, compare rate plans and locate charging stations. PG&amp;E also offers an EV Checklist to help customers get started on the path to EV ownership.PG&amp;E encourages customers to check out the current programs offered to help ease the transition to EVs, including:The Pre-Owned EV Rebate Program provides qualified residential customers up to $4,000 when purchasing or leasing a pre-owned all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle.The Empower EV and Multifamily Housing and Small Business EV Charger pilot programs provide no-cost EV charging infrastructure and resources to help address the costs of installing chargers at single-family homes, multifamily housing units, nonprofit organizations and small businesses throughout low- and moderate-income communities in PG&amp;E's service area.PG&amp;E's EV Fleet Program helps customers with medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in their fleets to install cost-effective charging infrastructure to save money, reduce tailpipe emissions and simplify maintenance.Through its EV Fast Charge Program, PG&amp;E is funding and installing infrastructure at qualifying customer sites to support the expansion of publicly available fast charging stations for light-duty vehicles.PG&amp;E's EV Charge Schools Pilot is installing level 2 charging stations at school facilities and educational institutions for staff, parents and students to charge their EVs. PG&amp;E helps fund the costs of purchasing and installing the EV charging equipment and networking fees at participating schools, as well as ongoing maintenance and operations.PG&amp;E's Progress to Electrify Its FleetPG&amp;E has committed to electrify its vehicle fleet in compliance with California's Advanced Clean Fleets regulation with the goal to electrify 3,800 vehicles in its fleet by 2030. Currently, approximately 11% of PG&amp;E's fleet of roughly 9,200 on-road vehicles are powered by alternative fuels including electricity.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis and recent news and developments in movie and news media, then head straight to the Top 5 Movie Studio and News Media Stocks. In the fast-changing media landscape, three major stories are making waves. Disney contemplates parting with ABC, Rupert Murdoch exits as chairman of Fox and News Corp, and a breakthrough may be in sight as studios make final offers to end a prolonged writers' strike. So, Why is Disney Selling ABC?Recent reports have indicated that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is in preliminary discussions to sell ABC to Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST), a media conglomerate with an extensive network of local TV stations and well-known networks such as CW and NewsNation. While these talks have garnered attention, it's worth noting that no formal steps have been taken in terms of hiring bankers or circulating sales documentation. Insiders familiar with the situation suggest that Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST) might face challenges meeting Disney's asking price for ABC.The idea of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) parting with ABC was initially floated by former CEO Bob Iger back in June. In an interview with CNBC, Iger hinted that traditional television assets, including ABC, may no longer be considered core to Disney's future strategy. This shift in perspective suggests that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is exploring new horizons and considering a more expansive approach to the television business. However, Iger also acknowledged the significant creative contributions that networks like ABC have made to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) over the years, leaving the door open to the possibility of a sale while emphasizing the value of the content and creativity that these networks have brought to the entertainment giant.Hollywood's Showdown: Inside the 2023 Writer's StrikeThe 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on May 2, 2023, stands as a significant disruption in American television and film production, similar to the setbacks witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the WGA's substantial labor strike in 2007-08. Story continuesRepresenting 11,500 screenwriters, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) is locked in an ongoing labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The strike's central issues revolve around the lack of agreement on a new contract, with writers advocating for improved compensation, enhanced funding and job security, larger writers' rooms, and limitations on the use of artificial intelligence in the writing process.The WGA's demands encompass AI regulations, adjusted pay structures to replace residuals, writers' room preservation, streaming pay standards, and job security. Notably, the Guild's proposals, as estimated by the WGA, could potentially cost studios $429 million annually, while studio counterproposals have been substantially lower, at $86 million.This strike has disrupted TV and film production, gaining support from Hollywood luminaries expressing backing for strike authorization on social media.High-level talks between studios and writers, involving key industry figures like Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s Bob Iger, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal film head Donna Langley, are ongoing. These negotiations come as media companies grapple with making streaming profitable and reviving theater attendance.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), in their securities filing in early September, adjusted their earnings expectations, anticipating a significant loss of $300 million to $500 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, with a full-year range of $10.5 billion to $11 billion, due to the strikes.Zaslav, at Goldman Sachs' Communacopia and Technology conference the next day on September 6, stressed the need to resolve the strikes swiftly, emphasizing the industry's commitment to a fair resolution. “We need to do everything we can to get people back to work,” Zaslav said at the investors’ conference. “We really have to focus as an industry, and we are, on trying to get this resolved in a way that’s really fair.”As of September 20, 2023, optimism surrounds the potential finalization of a deal by Thursday, though there's a warning that without an agreement, the strike could persist throughout the year, further affecting the industry and its stakeholders.Why is Rupert Murdoch Stepping Down?Rupert Murdoch, the iconic leader of News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA). and Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA), is stepping down as chairman to become chairman emeritus after a storied seven-decade career. His eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will assume the role of sole chairman at News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) and continue as Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA)'s executive and CEO. Rupert Murdoch's transition will take effect at the upcoming mid-November shareholder meetings. This move solidifies Lachlan's position as his father's successor, overseeing entities like the New York Post, Fox News, and Fox Entertainment.In a memo shared with CBS News, Murdoch emphasized that he's stepping back while in excellent health, while also stating that it's the opportune moment for him to embrace new roles.Armed with recent headlines about media and news companies, it's valuable to have insights into the stocks of movie studios and news media companies.Without further ado, let's move to the list of top movie studio and news media stocks.Movie Studio and News Media Stocks ListOur Methodology To create our list of movie studio and news media stocks, we initially gathered the largest movie studio and news media stocks listed on U.S. exchanges, focusing on their market capitalization (as of the writing of this piece) as the ranking metric of our list.

109,5ba65b36-ac8b-367f-a547-c72a577f3ea8,ALGN,2023-09-28,Here's Why You Should Buy Align Technology (ALGN) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-buy-align-technology-114700183.html,1695815220,STORY,"['ALGN', 'QTRX', 'HAE']","[Align Technologies ALGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the solid international expansion of the business. Higher subscriptions from the growing installed base of iTero scanners are boosting Service revenues. A strong solvent balance sheet appears highly promising.However, the exposure of the Invisalign system to several risks may significantly bring down the company’s net revenues. Aggressive competition from other industry players also remains a concern. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has increased 41% compared with the 20.4% rise of the industry and 16.9% growth of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $22.81 billion. ALGN projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 17.5% compared with 12.8% of the industry. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.90%. Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesGeographic Expansion Continues: Align Technology is expanding its sales and marketing by reaching new countries and regions, including new areas within Africa and Latin America. With the opening of its third clear aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland, the company now has a manufacturing facility in each of its operating territories — the Americas (Mexico), the APAC (China) and the EMEA (Poland).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also performs digital treatment planning and interpretation for restorative cases worldwide, including in Costa Rica, China, Germany, Spain, Poland and Japan, among others. The business expansion is likely to continue in 2023 through investments in resources, infrastructure and initiatives that help drive growth in Invisalign treatment, intraoral scanners and exocad CAD/CAM software in existing and new international markets.iTero in Focus: Align Technology’s iTero intraoral scanners, as the preferred scanning technology for digital dental scans, and exocad CAD/CAM software, as the dental restorative solution of choice for dental labs, are successfully expanding their foothold in the niche market globally.Story continuesIn terms of the latest developments with iTero, the company talked about the iTero-exocad Connector, which integrates the iTero intraoral camera and NIRI images with exocad DentalCAD 3.1 software and allows dental professionals to visualize the internal and external structure of teeth. According to the company, the use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization.Strong Solvency, Attractive Returns to Investors: With no debt on its balance sheet, Align Technology looks quite comfortable from the liquidity point of view. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $1.01 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023 compared favorably with $0.88 billion at the end of the first quarter. The company also generated strong cash flow and returned wealth to investors through share buybacks.DownsidesOverdependence on the Invisalign Technology System: The bulk of Align Technology's net revenues largely depends on the sale of its Invisalign Technology System, primarily Invisalign Technology Full and Invisalign Technology Teen. Therefore, the continued and widespread market acceptance of Invisalign Technology by orthodontists, GPs and consumers is critical to Align Technology’s future success. Management fears that if consumers start preferring a competitive product over Invisalign, the company’s operating results will suffer.Competitive Landscape: Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. The company also competes with products similar to Invisalign Technology, such as products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Align Technologies’ 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has increased from $8.77 to $8.78 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at 3.98 billion. This suggests a 6.59% rise from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Intuitive Surgical ISRG and Quanterix QTRX.Haemonetics has an estimated earnings growth rate of 26.1% in the fiscal 2024 compared with the industry’s 18.7%. HAE’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%. Its shares have rallied 18.3% against the industry’s 0.5% fall in the past year.HAE carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

This growth rate surge is largely attributed to rising gasoline prices. Similarly, the Producer Price Index (PPI) brought encouraging news, with an overall index rise of 0.7% for the month, surpassing the consensus forecast of 0.4%. Yet, this increase is primarily driven by the recent increases in gasoline prices, and in the long term, this boost in retail sales can benefit the economy by stimulating increased consumer spending, leading to positive growth effects across various sectors. Additionally, the higher PPI figures indicate a potential for increased profitability in the stock market, which can drive job creation and investments to further contribute to long-term economic growth and stability. These three Nasdaq stocks are the ones to buy in on long-term growth based on their profitability and product offerings for improved financials.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPalo Alto Networks Incorporated (PANW)Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comPalo Alto Networks Incorporated (NASDAQ:PANW) is a global leader in the cyber security industry. PANW stock is up 73.49% year-to-date (YTD).

The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology. These are massive spectrum holdings, particularly in the millimeter-wave bands for faster data transfer, end-to-end deep fiber resources and the ability to deploy a large number of small cells.In addition, the company has covered more than 40 million households with 5G Fixed Wireless Access Internet facility. The continued build-out of OneFiber and C-Band spectrum expansion has further expanded the reach and capacity of its 5G Ultra Wideband network. Verizon has also deployed nearly 57,000 fiber miles since 2020, connecting more than half of its cell sites with its own fiber. It is also offering the best of LTE and 5G Ultrawideband facilities with On Site 5G — a transformative on-premises, private 5G network — for business enterprises. This customized solution enables firms hitherto crippled with coverage gaps, lost connectivity, fractured security, data congestion and inconsistent service quality to have a dedicated capacity with adequate bandwidth to minimize costly downtime and missed opportunities.With about 68% of Verizon customers possessing 5G-capable smartphones, there is an increasing propensity to consume more 5G traffic, consequently freeing up capacity on the 4G network. This has improved the overall customer experience, with 5G customers enjoying superfast 5G network speed and 4G customers benefiting from improved performance from the shift in traffic.Verizon is building the entire network infrastructure and ecosystem to provide the most amazing 5G experience to customers. The company is likely to benefit from a disciplined network upgrade strategy backed by a customer-centric business model and diligent execution of operational plans. With the ramp-up of 5G service across the country, Verizon is expected to retain its lead in promulgating 5G mobile networks nationwide by using virtualized machines, advanced levels of operational automation and adaptability.Moreover, Verizon is offering various mix-and-match pricing in wireless and home broadband plans, which has led to solid customer additions with increased adoption of 5G devices and premium unlimited plans. In the enterprise and wholesale business, it is changing its revenue mix toward newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services.The company has further expanded Fios Forward to support digital inclusion and provide opportunities for underserved households to thrive in the digital world. With no data caps, Fios customers can experience faster upload and download than comparable plans. The company’s focus on online content delivery, mobile video and online advertising should drive growth.The stock has lost 16.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 7.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.0%, which is in line with the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Microsoft Microsoft's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. However, prior to this announcement, Microsoft's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 52.2%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 21% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendMicrosoft Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.92, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Microsoft has been growing its earnings per share at 35% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Microsoft Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, and Bob Schrader, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. The teleconference is being broadcast online and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start the call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Efrain and Bob for a financial update, and then we'll open up for your questions. But before getting into the discussion of our earnings results, I want to take a brief moment here to make a few brief comments to acknowledge Efrain Rivera, who announced his intention to retire as CFO effective October 12, 2023, though he will remain as a senior adviser at least through the end of the calendar year. Efrain has been a valued member of this senior leadership team at Paychex for the past 12 years. He has provided strong financial stewardship, but more importantly, great strategic leadership as well. During his time with Paychex, the company has transformed into a technology-enabled services company, and we significantly expanded our HR solutions and capabilities. Efrain has been a key strategic adviser and a catalyst for this transformation. Efrain, I think you know how truly I appreciate your intellect, your wisdom, your integrity, the guidance you've given me personally over my decade here and to the company. And we're all in great gratitude for what you've done for each one of us personally and for the company. Our customers, our employees, and our shareholders are better off because you were here. So thank you. Joining us today is Bob Schrader, who will succeed Efrain as CFO. Bob joined Paychex back in 2014 and is taking on progressive leadership roles over the past 9 years, including over the last 1.5 years since I was named President and subsequent CEO of being co-lead of many of our strategic review efforts and strategic initiatives. Bob's promotion is a part of a strategic succession plan to bring in an innovative leader who will continue to guide the company going forward. I want to congratulate Bob, and Bob, I look forward to continuing to work with you as I have in the last 10 years as we continue our track record of delivering strong financial results, and continuing to position Paychex as a leader, an innovator and a company that you can count on for predictable and sustainable results. Now moving on to the first quarter results, speaking of predictability and sustainability. We have begun the fiscal year '24 with solid growth of 7% in total revenue and 11% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We've seen operating margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points year-over-year while still investing in our business to drive future growth. Our first quarter reflected solid execution by our sales, service and all of our teams across Paychex. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions continued, resulting in strong quarter new sales revenue growth. We saw positive trends in client revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention during the quarter, and we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. We are starting to see improvements in some of our KPO and insurance metrics during the quarter, with good results across sales activity, insurance attachment and retention. We will know more after our open enrollment season is completed, which primarily runs from October through January, but at this time, we believe that the actions we have taken in response to headwinds we faced in 2023 and are beginning to gain traction. Employment levels within our client base have remained stable. Small businesses, which are central to the U.S. economy continues to show their resiliency. Our small business employment watch has shown that small businesses continue to add workers at sustained but modest rates. Also the trend in wages has shown some cooling and wage growth consistent with overall inflation. Our data indicates a continued stable macro environment for small and midsized businesses. We continue to monitor our leading indicators and are prepared to take appropriate actions to navigate any changes. But again, at this time, we don't see any material change to the macro environment. Small businesses have faced challenges getting access to capital and managing cash flows in this environment. This has continued to drive demand for our full-service employee retention tax credit service. I know there's been some recent news of the IRS pause in ERTC processing in order for them to perform increased audits. This is not expected to have an impact on our ability to provide this service, though it may take longer for our clients to receive their funds. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects and we continue to file amended returns with the IRS on their behalf. We anticipate that ERTC revenue will be a slight tailwind for the first half of the fiscal year and then turn to a headwind in the back half as the program ends. We are seeing greater adoption of HR software as businesses look to digitize their HR efforts to support the complexities of managing today's workforce in a more efficient manner. We also continue to see strong demand for our HR advisory solutions as businesses deal with the continued challenges of being an employer in today's challenging employment world. Paychex is uniquely positioned to offer a continuum of HR products, technology and services from do-it-yourself payroll all the way to full service POHR outsourcing. All of these products deliver a strong return on investment for our clients. For the 13th year in a row, we were named the leading retirement record keeper by a number of plans by PLANSPONSOR magazine. Our leadership position in retirement makes us an excellent resource for small businesses, and we continue to educate and execute on this opportunity. There has certainly been a lot of excitement about AI and related technology advancement around the monetization of large data sets. At Paychex, as we've talked on prior calls, this isn't anything new or it's not a fact. We have been using artificial intelligence to transform our business for over a decade. We have over 200 AI models that are actively working in our business today designed to provide valuable insights fueled by our vast data assets. Our award-winning retention insight tool uses AI-based predictive analytics to provide HR leaders with early insights into potential employee retention issues. Our Flex intelligence engine is an embedded AI chat capability within our Flex platform that allows the customer to get quick answers to over 900 of the most common questions and access over 1,200 instructional resources. Companies like paycheck with large amounts of data will clearly be the winner with AI. And we will continue to harness the power of AI and leverage our extensive data to drive internal efficiencies and provide actionable insights and solutions to our clients. This quarter, we continue to be recognized for our innovation, service and the positive impact we are having on our customers, our industry and the world. For the third time, Paychex has been recognized by TrustRadius with a 2023 Tech Cares award for the company's corporate social responsibility programs and our community impact. We also received an award from Selling Power for our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce and from Forbes as one of the best employers for women in 2023. On the product and service side, NelsonHall once again identified Paychex as a leader in its 2023 next-generation HCM technology market report. We also learned a silver Brandon Hall Group 2023 HR Excellence Award for breadth and depth of training that we provide our HR advisers to keep them up to speed on the ever-changing complexities of the employer-employee relationship. Paychex was also named the 2023 Constellation Research on the short list for best payroll for North American small and midsized businesses. The depth and breadth of our product suite provides American businesses the freedom to succeed with the technology and advice that they desperately need to remain competitive in a very complicated world. I want to thank our over 16,000 global employees who consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. It's because of them that we're off to such a good start this fiscal year. I'll now turn it over to Bob Schrader to give you a brief update on our financial results for the first quarter. Bob?Story continuesRobert L. SchraderYes. Thanks, John, and good morning. It's good to be here with you this morning, and I certainly look forward to working with each of you as we move forward. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements. Obviously, those involve risks, and we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release and our investor presentation that will be posted later today. I'll start providing a summary of our first quarter results, and then I'm going to turn it over to Efrain, and he'll give an update on our financial position and updated guidance for the year. Total revenue for the quarter increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $956 million, primarily driven by higher clients and client employees, product penetration, price realization in HR ancillary services, we continue to see increased attachment and demand for our HR solutions retirement and time and attendance solutions. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $298 million, driven primarily by higher revenue per client and higher average worksite employees. As John mentioned, we definitely saw some positive momentum in the PEO in the first quarter as it relates to both sales activity and medical plan participation and attachment. Those were obviously headwinds last year, and we're definitely seeing some positive signs as we moved through the first quarter here. Interest on funds held for clients increased 83% to $33 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $750 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and investments that we've made into the business. Operating income increased 8% to $536 million with an operating margin of 41.7%. That's a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior year period and diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.16 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% for the quarter to $1.14 per share. I'll now turn it over to Efrain to take you through our financial position and our updated guidance for the year.Efrain RiveraThanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I start, just wanted to say thank you, John, for the generous words. It's been an absolute professional privilege and honor to have been with Paychex during all this time. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash and earnings. Our balanced for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.7 billion. Total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of August 21, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $656 million for the first quarter was driven by net income and changes in working capital. There was some influence of timing there. It wasn't quite as strong as a percentage would indicate, but nonetheless, it was a very solid quarter. As you know, our earnings quality, which some of you have pointed out is among the best candidly in the entirety of the S&amp;P 500. In the first quarter, we acquired a small company that purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under nonrecourse arrangements. This acquisition is a good strategic fit with another business that we have called Paychex Advance, and that business purchases accounts receivable for temporary staffing clients. This acquisition will provide an opportunity for our small business clients to manage working capital challenges, as John alluded to earlier, we've seen over the last several years that access to financing is very important for small and medium-sized businesses, and we think this plays well into our -- in our portfolio of businesses that we have. We're very excited to have it. The acquisition at this stage is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial results this year. We paid a total of $322 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar superb amazing 47%. Now let me turn to guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. I'm going to give you color on not only the full year, the first half and the second half, and we typically do that at this stage. As you noted, we have raised guidance for interest on funds held for clients and for adjusted EPS, but I want to go through a little bit of color as we go through to give you a sense of what our thinking is. Our current outlook is as follows. You saw that Management Solutions still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients now, as I mentioned, expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million raised from our previous guide of $135 million to $145 million and before I get the question, are we anticipated a range? Are we anticipating a range of additional increases? No. We're poised looking at what the Fed is doing just like everyone else is, but this is our best estimate of at least some additional activity by the Fed, but not -- likely not contemplating all of it. To the extent that the Fed does something now, we'll have a conversation later in the year, maybe the Fed will decide that they actually do want to pause. But at this point, that's where we anticipate being. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but now we think this is likely towards the high end of the range. So operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. Effective income tax expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9% to 11%, and this is raised from our previous guide of 9% to 10%. This full year outlook assumes current macroeconomic conditions which have some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes and their impact on the economy. And I would just say, it's been almost, I would say, at least 6 quarters where we keep saying ""Hey, we don't know what's going to happen in the back half of the year and it could change our outlook."" I think John summarized it very well. At this point, things look pretty stable. So we're feeling directionally more and more confident in the back half. Project in the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 7% and operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I heard some comments after first when we released guidance that we have a ramp in the back half of the year. I wouldn't describe our current guidance as a significant ramp in the back half of the year. Obviously, there are differences in the back half of the year that will navigate through and talk to you, but the difference between first half and second half is not dramatic. Of course, all of these comments are subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on the second quarter call. So let me just repeat a couple of things to make sure. First half 2024, total revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, operating margin in the range of 40% to 41%. And then in the second half, at this point, we anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 7%, operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I refer you to our investor slides on the website for additional information. Before handing things back over to John, I would just like to say that I appreciate the relationship I've built with each of you during my time here at Paychex. We've had a long time together, and it's time to hand the reins over to someone else who I think will do an even better job than I have. One of the things that strikes me during that entire time, and many of you have been here for the entire ride. I got a call and someone -- or I got a note and someone said, Efrain you're making me old because I've retired two CFOs at Paychex. So I think that's unfortunately true. We're all getting a little bit older. But one of the things that always strikes me is that we are covered by the best group of analysts in the business. I say that even though I've disagreed with some of you over the years, and I still think you have us rated too low, but be that as it may. I can't argue with some of the things that you write. So -- and in a separate note, I just want to say this, I've worked with Bob Schrader for many years, both here and prior to Paychex. I know that I'm leaving you in very capable hands. And I'm sure that Bob will do an even better job than the one that I do. And with that, let me turn it back to John.John B. GibsonWell, thank you, Efrain. Before I open the call for questions, probably two things. One, we have a lot of people here. And last time, Efrain did a great job of providing rules on questions, particularly around compound questions and multiple follow-ups. So if we could just follow the Efrain rule, in honor of Efrain's retirement. I know he would greatly appreciate it, and maybe we can create a new tradition here. But no, feel free to answer any of questions. But I would like to also add, make everyone aware, there's many ways you can learn more about Paychex and there really the amazing success stories and the impact that we're having on the world. We recently launched a series of reports that you can find on our Investor page, both our annual report, our ESG report and a new client impact report. And very shortly, you'll be seeing a new Investor Relations 101 presentation that will be launched on the website prior to our annual meeting in the coming weeks. And again, I think these documents provide a lot more color and really a lot more insights of just how significant, how broad our products are, how big an impact we're having on our customers, how big an impact we're having on our employees, how and why Paychex is known as one of the most admired the most ethical and most innovative companies in the world, and I encourage you to check that out. So with that, advertisement of our investor website, Shelby, you can now turn it over for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.Ramsey Clark El-AssalCongratulations to you, Efrain. We'll miss hearing your voice on these calls, certainly. I was wondering if you could comment on the interest from corporate investments was relatively high in the first quarter and it doesn't necessarily feel like that's going to flow through for -- to the full year guide in terms of maybe recurring each quarter. So maybe if you could talk about that contribution to other income and just how you might see it trending the rest of the year.Efrain RiveraYes. So Ramsey, there's a couple of things that go into that line beyond just -- so for everyone, who isn't focusing on that line that much. So that's a combination of our interest expense. Our interest income from corporate portfolios primarily and also some gains and losses on investments that we have in a small investment fund that we have. Those things can swing a bit during the year and are subject to whatever we think the balance is going to be on corporate funds during the year. We made an acquisition, so we expect that during the year, our average corporate balances will be lower, so that will generate lower interest income. And then the other part of that Ramsey, is gains and losses on that other investment as we mark-to-market can change from quarter-to-quarter. So there could be a little bit of lumpiness in that number, but it might be a little bit different. I would say one other thing, just by way of color on that line. We ended up with a fairly high cash balance that was influenced by timing. I think I called that out or if I didn't, let me call it out now. It just really had to do with the day on which we closed the quarter. So our cash balances were higher. They are likely to be a bit lower -- not a bit lower but lower as we progress through the year. So you might see that number change a bit.Ramsey Clark El-AssalOkay. Fantastic. And a quick follow-up. If you could talk about SECURE Act 2.0, how you see that evolving and how you see that potentially -- presumably benefiting the business over time?John B. GibsonYes. Look, SECURE Act 2.0, I think, is a great action, a great step that the government has taken is encouraging and helping small and midsized businesses provide for the retirement of their employees. We're certainly out there educating the market on the opportunity. It really provides an opportunity for them to add a 401(k) plan, get a tax credit back for the implementation fees, sort of the setup fees of the plan and then allows them to actually do a match for their employees and get that back into a tax credit as well. So we're very happy, our 401(k) business has continued to have very, very strong growth that has continued. The thing I continue to remind people, we have some experience in this and other state mandates. And what we realized is that there's a lot of education that has to go on to get the market educated about the cost of a 401(k) plan, the benefits of a 401(k) plan. And certainly, we're out actively in the market, educating the market, educating our strategic partners on that. And we believe that the SECURE Act 2.0 is going to allow us to continue to sustain the double-digit growth rates that we've seen in the retirement business in the last several years.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.Daniel Joseph MaxwellThis is Daniel Maxwell on for Andrew today. To start off, I was hoping you could dig in a little on any changes the dynamic between ASO and PEO and whether over the past couple of months, you've seen any preferences shift on that? You called it out the last couple of quarters. I was wondering if anything changed.John B. GibsonYes. So I would say this, we continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions across the board. And I would say that the balance is probably more back to prior to '23, where we saw a little shift to ASO, we've seen more of what are the more traditional balance of ASO to PEO. As we mentioned on our last call, we've made some changes, I think, to our product portfolio in the PEO that I think has balanced that out a little bit. The other thing that I would point to that we mentioned on the prior call is that when we over-index with ASO in the prior year, we always look at that as a great opportunity for us to go back to those customers and then upgrade them or select them into our PEO product. And we started doing that. We actually -- that's a good example of AI, where we're actually using AI tools to be able to go into the ASO base and find clients that we believe there's going to be a valuable value proposition to be in the PEO relationship for a multitude of different reasons. And that program actually has shown results in the first quarter. It's early in the process, but I would tell you that our transition of ASO to PEO customers -- the number of customers that we transitioned this first quarter versus last first quarter was nearly 2x the number of clients. So exactly what we thought could happen, which was we over-indexed when the ASO in the prior fiscal year, we continue to sell outside to new logos, and that was also double-digit strong in appeal in the first quarter. So we had both benefits. We had strong outside the base, growth in PEO in the first quarter, and we had good migration or upgrades ASO to PEO, which was a good start to the first quarter. We still got three quarters to go and we're in the middle of our open enrollment, which is critical there. But good early signs. We had good signs in the PEO in the fourth quarter, and we talked about that on the last call, and that just accelerated in the first quarter. So now we just got to see if that can continue into the core selling season.Daniel Joseph MaxwellGreat. Good to hear. And then for my follow-up. Any detail you can give on the increase to the direct insurance costs from workers' comp? Any color or any reminder of your exposure to any volatility in that area?Robert L. SchraderYes. This is Bob. Yes, I mean, we obviously take risk in the PEO business on workers' comp. Obviously, we are very prudent in managing that risk and picky on which risk we're willing to take. I'd say there's growth in the quarter primarily driven by -- we have growth in worksite employees that's going to drive higher workers' compensation costs. We go through every quarter and do true-ups of our reserves and so forth. But nothing specific to call out other than growth in the business that would drive growth and direct cost.John B. GibsonYes. There's been no change to our underwriting standards. There's no change to our programs in terms of caps and limits and no real change in the overall program performance. So...Daniel Joseph MaxwellCongrats again to Efrain on your retirement and Bob on your promotion.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.Bryan C. BerginEfrain and Bob, let me echo my congrats as well. Efrain, it's been nice working with you here. Enjoy your retirement. I got to ask the question because we've gotten a lot of questions just as it relates to ERTC. So it doesn't sound like you have any change in your fiscal '24 revenue expectation there surrounding ERTC after this recent IRS announcement. But can you just dig in there a little bit more since there have been a lot of questions, is there any evidence of any clients wanting to potentially delay submitting new claims there? Any dynamic there to be mindful of?John B. GibsonListen, Bryan, I appreciate the question. Look, ERTC was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We continue to submit, no one's wanting to delay. The program is going to end, and again, the IRS announcement is not stopping anyone's efforts in -- our efforts in approaching clients or assisting them in filing the tax credits. And in fact, the IRS specifically commented to clients and small business owners that they should seek trusted partners to complete their filings.The IRS -- pause in processing and accepting. So they're accepting filings, it's really due to some just really bad actors out there that are providing that advice to small businesses and putting them at risk. I talked about this probably a year ago when this started, and these little pop-up companies started to show up. And again, I think that the IRS is trying to do a prudent thing to tamp down on fraud and also to make sure that small businesses are not getting bad advice from these pop-up firms. So we actually are continuing to accept and encouraging our clients and prospects to file, and we provide a service, we're really confident that the advice we're giving them is adequate, and we'll continue to try to get the processing done before the filing deadline early next calendar year. The delay impact for the client is really going to be in the processing, which is really going to be when they get the refund.Bryan C. BerginOkay. Very good. That's clear. And then my follow-up, just on the target here. Can you share as it relates to the M&amp;A, the financial profile of this target, just any revenue attribution to call out now included in the current year outlook? I did hear you mention, I believe the upper end of your growth range, but just wanted to confirm there were no organic offsets of that.Efrain RiveraOrganic offsets? What do you mean by that.Bryan C. BerginAs far as anything in the organic side being offset by now any incremental inorganic in the year?Efrain RiveraNot really, Bryan. I mean it will contribute a modest amount of revenue. We'll call it out as we go through the year, but it's not masking something or additive in that respect. I think there's a number of different vectors of growth in the company that are working pretty well. So no, not really.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.Ashish SabadraBob and Efrain, congrats to both of you. Just on my question, I wanted to better understand the raising of the guidance and confidence in the back half. Is that both on management solution as well as CEO? Any color on that front?Efrain RiveraYes. So one is kind of, I'd say, process and structural. And then the second is the substance of what we saw in the first half. So the process and the substance is simply that at a point in time, you're taking a snapshot and saying, okay, when we issued the guidance back 4 months or so ago, we had a certain set of macro conditions. We didn't know whether they would hold at that point. The macro conditions, as John said earlier, haven't changed significantly. So we fast forward 4 months and now we have more certainty as to what environment we're looking at, at least in the medium term, medium term being 3 to 6 months. So that's one.The second part is we look at the trends in the business, where we close, where we correct in terms of the trends that we saw. You heard some of the comments that John said on the PEO. So much of that was what we expected from an execution standpoint, but it's one thing that's expected, it's another thing to deliver it. And thus far, we've started on a good note.So those are two parts of it. So by the time we get to September and we're into October now, we know with a reasonable degree of certainty what Q2 looks now, we project forward into the back half of the year. And do we feel reasonably confident based on the combination of all the factors that we're seeing that the back half expectations will be as we expected. We sit here, the answer is yes.So as you look at the guidance that I anticipate that PEO will strengthen in the back half of the year. And at this point, we're seeing indication. Can we say that certainty? You can never say anything certainly. But we -- based on all of that combination of factors, we feel pretty positive about where things are trending.John B. GibsonYes. I -- just to add on to that, I think, again, every business has -- we have a rhythm and the third quarter is a critical -- that's our selling season. And so what the macro environment will be in the third quarter, fourth quarter. Those are always the things we're trying to guess.I think what I would characterize at this point in time is when we left the fourth quarter, I talked about the second half of our last fiscal year, we actually saw new sales bookings both in management solutions and the PEO and Insurance accelerating. We continue to see that double-digit momentum in the first quarter, HR Outsourcing, ASO and PEO, strong mid-market in the quarter. Retirement strong, digital payroll is strong. So when we look at the demand environment, then we look at the employment environment with our index and what we're seeing, the first quarter set up to be kind of a repeat and continuation of what we saw in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter.Now as it relates to the PEO business, as we talked about, the insurance is a portion of that insurance attachments, it's part of the reason why we have a little bit wider range. What you have to determine there is how many companies continue to offer benefits to their employees, that's the first choice. The second choice is how many of those employees sign up for health insurance and what plans do they sign up for.Now we are only a quarter way through that decision process, which really has already started about 25% that went through. What I would say at this point, 25% away, we're running a little bit on par where we expected. And if that continues, I think that's what gives us confidence in the back half. But again, I still got three quarters of that process left. And again, I want to be predictable relative to what we should expect. And so we're being, I think, prudently cautious in making sure that we're executing both management solution. We're taking advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace. And then in the PEO and Insurance, making sure we're doing what we need to do to make sure we have a successful open enrollment and drive insurance attachment.Ashish SabadraThat's great color. And maybe if I can just ask a quick follow-up question on the commentary on the PEO side on the improved insurance attach rate. Obviously, last quarter, you also talked about a leaner product. And I was wondering if that's driving better adoption or you're seeing just better -- or stronger demand for insurance products?John B. GibsonYes. I -- so I would say that there's a multitude of things, but we probably tweaked every aspect of how we approach the insurance, both in terms of analytics of what we're doing relative to targeting customers that we think can drive -- we can drive the value proposition there. We've changed the technology. We've changed our advisory approach, and we've expanded the products of choices that both employers and employees can have. We've improved our educational tools in that process. We've got a lot more engagement with our HR advisers with clients around that.So I would say, across the board, after what we experienced a year ago in the first quarter, we looked at every aspect of it and the team has really done a great job there and just reimagining how we need to approach this. And again, we're only 25% of the way through, but we're seeing results from those activities. And I do think demand for insurance, I think it's going to be interesting. We were very pleased with our renewals. I mean, if you read in the general press, right now, you will see that there is a degree of health inflation. And when that occurs, we do typically see more customers shopping for alternatives and we think we have a good value proposition there.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.Scott Darren WurtzelMaybe just going back to the acquisition. Just wondering if you can maybe give a little bit more color on the strategic rationale behind it and sort of said another way, like why now with this deal and maybe relative to some of the other targets you were looking at?Efrain RiveraWell, I'll bracket it in 3 ways. The first thing is that John alluded to or said earlier, the ability for small businesses to access funding and small and medium service, I should say, access funding is important so we had our eyes on looking to build our capability in that area.The second thing is acquisitions are, as you know, they don't always present themselves in exactly the timing, which you expect them to. And when an opportunity arises, then you do what you need to do to take advantage of it. We saw an opportunity for a high-quality asset and decided that it was the right time.And I'd say the third is that it's an interesting environment for small businesses. So where access to funding opportunities is becoming more tricky given what's happened with banks and with rising interest rates. So we think the timing seemed to fit pretty well. And again, yes, I don't spend too much time. It's a relatively modest acquisition based on our revenue side. But we think we've had a lot of success with our Paychex Advance acquisition, and it's a very profitable corner of the market, and we think we can do the same thing with the company that we bought. Possible alternative by the way.John B. GibsonYes. I would just add, neither one of these things are new to us. We kind of got dragged into this. When COVID hit, if you remember the PPP program and the banks were struggling to figure out how to access it and we put a program together. And that started a partnership with several fintechs. And we did both technology integrations, et cetera, and that led to more of a partnership approach. And then we have several partners that if we have clients that meet our risk profile and are wanting to maybe need to fund a payroll or something like that. We've got partners that we could introduce them to.So we got kind of introduced to this concept and certainly then the macro environment with what Efrain just said, banks, rising interest rates. And we just know we have a lot of great customers out there, small midsized customers that are strong businesses that just really struggled to get access to capital at affordable rates. And so that started just through a partnership piece.And then we had the advanced business, which was kind of doing this for staffing companies and we've been in that and it's been a great business for us, a great acquisition business for us, introduces payroll customers. And those are a lot of positives there and those are adjacent. And so literally, it's one of the classic, you're at a conference and you know people who know people and the timing seemed right. And just based upon the need we saw and the fact that we thought there were opportunities for us to potentially help our strong customers continue to grow their business. And we've already been introducing them to partners. Why not introduce them to ourselves and get a piece of that action. So that was kind of the strategic rationale. And it's a small -- like you said, very small at this point in time.Scott Darren WurtzelGot it. That's super helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I mean, just one quickly on the float portfolio. When we think about the recent Fed commentary in dot plots showing maybe a sustained higher rate trajectory than maybe we were expecting a few months ago. I'm afraid, I know you've talked about in the past going to position the portfolio more on longer duration securities. I'm just wondering if this -- the recent Fed commentary sort of gears you even more towards sort of the longer duration securities in the portfolio rather than shorter duration.Efrain RiveraYes. We are reviewing it monthly to figure out based on -- and looking at the same dot plots you are to see what happens. I would just go back to something I said from the point that the Fed started raising rates.The problem is in taking advantage of the rates going up. The problem is what happens when you come down. And so we're positioning the portfolio, we will position the portfolio, and I'm sure Bob will do the same to be able to manage it in an orderly way on the way down. So we're looking at -- this is a time when you want to go longer if you can, even if perhaps there are opportunities on the short end of the curve because at some point, it will come up or come down. And that's what you got to figure out how best to manage and that's what we're working on.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangI just want to follow-up on the acquisition, the $200 million acquisition here in the strategic fit with Paychex Advance, I remember when that deal was announced, and there was a lot about payroll funding and factoring and whatnot. Is this now more about early wage access, and some of the more modern funding opportunities for employees. I just want to make sure I understand what you're adding specifically here.Efrain RiveraYes. The short answer is no. So that's a separate initiative that at some point, we'll talk about when it becomes more significant. Now, Tien-Tsin, what they do is more focused on receivable. So obviously, we dipped our toe in the water with staffing firms, but we saw an opportunity that was broader than that because our -- all of our clients to have one degree or another receivables, and it can become a source of financing. And we've got the data to make it work.Tien-Tsin HuangOkay. Very clear. So is this an AR opportunity?Efrain RiveraYes.Tien-Tsin HuangUnderstood. Okay. No follow-up for me. I just want to wish you, Efrain, all the best, of course, for the next chapter. And I've said it before, you've been really helpful for us for a long time. So thanks for that, definitely going to miss talking to you.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup.Peter Corwin ChristiansenWelcome, and congrats to Bob and certainly, congrats and thank you to Efrain. John, I want to dig a little bit into your thoughts on SMB lending in general. Obviously, this news is a big money center bank is getting into the payroll business a bit more and SMB lending is often thought as a nice adjacency here. Should we consider the possibility that Paycheck may further delve into SMB lending, whether it be merchant cash advances or other types of working capital solutions. Do you see that in Paychex' future?John B. GibsonWell, look, I think what we're trying to do is make sure that we're focused on what do we need to do to help our clients succeed. And as I said, whether that's through partnership or if there's opportunities for us to participate in that process, integrating that with our technology, those are really the things that we're interested in. And when we hear our clients and we're engaging those clients to our advisers on a constant basis, say this is an issue for them. We go and search for answers, and partnerships are part of that. And as I said, we have several partnerships with fintech that we're doing relationships with large banks. I can go deeper on that if you want to know about banking and banks in payroll. We do -- we have businesses that do that.But I think, in general, you should not read anything more into this than the factors they need out there that we had an adjacent business that has been very successfully managed and has been a good return for our shareholders. And there was a natural relationship and opportunity that we thought by us coming in with our balance sheet, with our expertise, with our client base, that we could potentially make something of this. And so I don't think you should be reading anything more into it, an opportunistic acquisition that matches a need that we're seeing today from our customers and one that based upon the macro environment, we think are going to grow. And I don't think this is a competition with any of the major banks. Most of these clients are just not getting access to the funds. It's just not available. And if there's more tightening at the regional bank, which is generally the go-to place for a lot of these small and medium-sized businesses, that's not good for small business owners. And so we're going to try to figure out how we can build partnerships to do that.Peter Corwin ChristiansenThat's super helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just wondering if you could call out any trends balances trade wise? Are there areas where you see Paychex has an opportunity to improve competitive dynamics or vice versa, some areas where you're a bit more on defense versus offense. Just any sense on balance of trade versus some of your competitors and maybe some of the regionals as well.John B. GibsonWell, I mean, I'd just say this. As we've talked about, our sales momentum continues in the first quarter that we saw in the second quarter. On the macro side, when I'm looking at it, I'm not seeing any major shifts at all relative to balance of trade in the competitive environment. I commented on the fourth quarter. When I do look under it, again, these things go back and forth. I would say it's gaining a little more in our favor on the competitive front in several key areas that we monitor. We had a good first quarter in the mid-market. That was -- there were several good signs there as well. But it's not monumental, Peter. It's the same market, very stable competitive environment. Same set of competitors, low end, mid, high-end PEO. It's the same kind of character, same kind of pricing environment, competitive environment. It's a competitive marketplace. We'll leave it at that. And I think we're winning more than our fair share.Operatorwe'll take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.Bryan Connell KeaneI want to ask about the free cash flow increase year-over-year in the first quarter, it was substantial. I think it was up over 23%. How much of that was that onetime in working capital? And how much should that carry through the fiscal year? Or should we see a decrease in kind of growth rate in free cash flow to equal out to the same growth of the 9% to 11% earnings growth by the time we get to the end of the fiscal year?Robert L. SchraderYes, Bryan, this is Bob. I mean, I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think as you guys know, we typically don't have big swings in our working capital. And as Efrain mentioned, we had a little bit of a timing there at the end of the quarter. The quarter ended on a big collection day. So we had a big influx of cash that would go out the next day.So the way to really think about our operating cash flows and then obviously, free cash flow gets impacted by M&amp;A. So there was a little bit of an impact there in Q1 to free cash flow. But typically, our operating cash flow growth is going to trend in line with our net income growth. And so you'll see that moderate as we move through the year, and that's what you should expect from a growth standpoint.Bryan Connell KeaneGot it. Got it. And then just a follow-up. I was hoping to get an update on what you guys are seeing for SMB bankruptcy rates. I know they've been a little bit elevated in the recent past here. I'm just curious if that's still elevated levels? Or has it become more normalized?John B. GibsonYes. No. So when we say elevated, I think that they're elevated over what we saw during the COVID period, there's 2, 2.5 years. Actually, bankruptcies are still slightly below where they were pre-pandemic and kind of trending toward a normalized rate. We have seen that, I would say, particularly in that start-up businesses when we had the big start-up boom, we've seen a lot more out of businesses on the very small, and I think we called that out in our press release. Revenue retention at near record levels. And when you look at our HR outsourcing business is at record levels. And so that's what we've kind of seen on the bankruptcy side.The other interesting stat related to bankruptcies that kind of surprised me in the first quarter is we actually saw an uptick in new business starts. And again, we had this big elevated area and then we kind of gravitated back down towards kind of normal levels that we actually saw in the first quarter, new business starts click up, which was interesting.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies.Samad Saleem SamanaGreat. Efrain, I'm going to missing working with you and enjoy a well-deserved retirement, sir. I appreciate all the help over the years. Maybe just a quick one for me, a lot of my questions have been asked. But just how are you guys seeing the top of the funnel in terms of inbound leads to the digital channel? Any change in maybe interest levels, registrations for webinars, just anything that would look as a leading indicator of bookings? And how is that trend in maybe first quarter?John B. GibsonAgain, I'll go back. If our sales are growing at double-digit rates in the first quarter, digital is an ever-growing portion of that business, you can surmise that, that's growing as well. So we continue to see strong demand environment across the businesses, both digitally and really across the board. I wouldn't doubt that.Samad Saleem SamanaGreat. And then maybe just on your own hiring plans with the quarter doing better than expected, maybe some trends you're seeing, any change to your own sales hiring plans? Or should we expect maybe the original game plan for the year?John B. GibsonNo. Really, no change in plans. We're certainly in the second quarter, always in the staffing up and making sure we're fully staffed and able to cover any thought or planned attrition going into the selling season, both on the service side and the sales side.So I think it's fair to say when you have now going on close to 3 quarters of strong demand when you've been relatively, is it going to stay? Is it going to stay? We certainly want to make sure that we're properly staffed to take full advantage of all the opportunity in our selling season. and we're fully staffed on the operations and the service side to make sure that we can both onboard and services clients during year-end.Operatorwe'll take our next question from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.Eugene M. SimuniCongratulations, Efrain and Bob. Efrain, we'll miss working with you. Bob, look forward to working with you. Just have two quick follow-ups. One, tying together your comments on sales and current, can you comment how that's together to client growth trends this year so far? Last year was a bit below your historical target range. And I think you commented last quarter that this year, you're looking for reacceleration in client growth kind of above 2% a year. So can you comment on how it's going so far?Efrain RiveraEugene, I'll start that and then John can cover. It really -- if I were to give you a number, it would give you some sort of full sense of what reality is. It's almost impossible to draw a conclusion on that or where you are in first quarter. In some ways, some trends of -- some trends are positive, and you can drive conclusions on project out through the year, but client base is really a tricky one. And the reason is just lose so many and gain so many in the selling season that it's almost difficult to predict. We expect to be a bit better than we were last year, but it's still early innings.Eugene M. SimuniGot it. Okay. And then -- and now the follow-up is on the PEO and the question there is, in your PEO customer base in terms of kind of checks per control, are you seeing any trends that are different from your overall base whether better or worse employment growth?Robert L. SchraderYes. I would say it's probably consistent. We definitely see employees and our PEO clients in our PEO business, adding employees. I wouldn't say it's a huge tailwind, but it's positive and probably in line with what we're seeing in other areas of the business.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird.Mark Steven MarconEfrain, we go back a long way, it's been an absolute pleasure working with you. And I want to thank you for the relationship. And Bob, looking forward to working with you. But Efrain, it's been an absolute pleasure.A lot of questions have been on the short term. John, one big picture question. a quarter ago, everybody was asking about AI. Obviously, you've been -- Paychex has been doing a lot with AI for a long period of time. I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about now that some of these LOMs have been around for a couple of quarters and permeated the consciousness. How are you thinking about further evolution of your journey with AI? And what are the longer-term implications from a margin perspective or a scope of business perspective?John B. GibsonWow, that's -- Mark, that is a big question.Mark Steven MarconEverybody is asking about the quarter.John B. GibsonNo. It's a -- And it's a great one because I really think this is probably has the potential to be one of the biggest differentiators that's going to help a company like Paychex separate ourselves from the rest. Because as you said, the large language model starts with a large. And the only way that this works is you've got to have large sets of data and large sets of data coming through to continually train those models.I will also say relative to -- it's expensive to do and it's getting more expensive both in terms of finding the people and buying the technology. And I think that's going to also back some people out. But let me just give you some idea. I mean we have multiple teams across the organization looking at every aspect of our business, front office, back office, G&amp;A and evaluating how we could better leverage all of the capabilities of the data that we have.So think of it today, we're recording 6.5 million calls with our clients. This year, we're transcribing those calls. We are using analytics to determine whether or not we have a service opportunity or if we have a sales opportunity or an upsell opportunity in the conversations that they're having with our advisers. We are already doing almost 1 million natural language processing analysis on our sales conversations with prospects, looking for what are the right phrases, words, market segments, where we're winning. And then adjusting that overnight and changing our sales play the next morning. Using some of that in our PEO, we've nearly doubled our close rate in the first quarter. I mean I just could go on and on about where we're piloting and testing and using our data to do this.And so I think there are tremendous opportunities and then when you begin to productize this and start thinking about the value that we can provide, the retention insights, which we launched, I keep bringing this up, we launched this a 1.5 years ago, we want an award for AI. And I think at the time, no one even wrote anything much about it. And because I was thinking people knew what AI was and quite frankly, it's -- I think that's just one example of multiple examples we're going to be able to drive more value to customers. And so I think we're going to be able to go with a value proposition. And to be fair, there's other large competitors that probably are going to make similar claims. But I certainly think it's a differentiator. If you run a local payroll company, you're not going to have the same data and the insights that Paychex has relative to what's going on in your area, and what's going on in the labor market. And if we can harness that and use technology to deliver that to our salespeople, our service people and our HR advisers, I think the trusted adviser position that we've already established ourselves for small and medium-sized businesses is only going to be further sustained and probably increase. So I think Bob is going to give me the hook to give us the bandwagon (inaudible).Mark Steven MarconAnd then for my follow-up, just a quick question. Just in terms of the margin uplift from the first half to the second half, aside from normal seasonality and obviously, float balances certain forms processing. Is there anything to call out above and beyond that? Is it just a pace of investments in the first half being a little bit front-end loaded?Efrain RiveraYes. I think that's it, Mark. I'd say a couple of things. One is we -- if you noticed the pattern and P&amp;L pretty obvious. We have tended to front load a little bit more of spending in part to make sure that we're prepared for selling season. And then as we get into the fourth quarter, typically, we've heavied up our spending in anticipating -- in anticipations starting the year stronger. Q3, as you know, because you have that influx of annual processing generally makes Q3 margins higher. And then Q4, I don't anticipate it to be quite as heavy as it's been in prior years when you combine those two you get to a little bit more spending in the first half, a little bit less in the back half but more revenue in the back half without creating the margin uplift that I mentioned. There's nothing unusual about it, it just is the way that the revenue and expenses flow through.OperatorWe'll take our last question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.James Eugene FaucetteI want to share my congratulations to Bob and Efrain. Just wanted a quick follow-up question here on PEO and you had mentioned some of your customers, and I think you've kind of talked about this and had pulled back on providing ancillary services like insurance and 401(k), et cetera. But now you're calling out some growth in those same ancillary services as the driver of PEO growth quarter.What are the things that you're watching for to gauge like the durability of that improvement and kind of response by your customers and employers?Efrain RiveraSo James, you mean what are we looking at?James Eugene FaucetteYes. Yes. Like what are the things in the more macro economy or even in your customer behavior to try to gauge and project the durability of that improvement?Efrain RiveraWell, let me start, and then John can and maybe Bob can weigh in. So I just want to make sure that I'm answering the question correctly. I think the key thing, and if you step back on the PEO is we saw that attachment last year was where we expected it to be. And also we saw an opportunity to tilt the balance a bit between what was an ASO sale versus a PEO sale.So what we're looking at, at least to start the year is first, are we positioned appropriately on the insurance side to be able to take advantage of that and create momentum as we go into some key points in the year, which occur in the fall and then at the beginning of the year on insurance attachment. One thing, James, that's important to point out.Last year, when we were talking at this point, we were seeing actually something unusual, where we're seeing clients dropping insurance and actually lowering their attachment -- I'm sorry, not their attachment, their enrollment. So we haven't seen that at start of the year. So the absence of a negative is positive. So I think we're right. That's one piece. And John called out something I think that is that is important. Also that balance between what we're seeing on ASO and PEO, that seems to come into a little bit more balance. So I think those two things both have started the year well. So I don't know...John B. GibsonYes. No, I just trying to understand. So remember, we've got -- you've got existing client behavior, particularly as it relates to attachment. And again, it's always difficult because the insurance, it's pass-through, it doesn't have a huge impact on margin as an oversized impact on the revenue number, right, because it's the way it works.And so you have two dynamics. One was existing customers that have the product, are they continuing to want that attachment? And then what are they attaching? Are they catching the Cadillac plan or the basic low-value plan? That's the first decision. And last year, we had something we normally don't see, and we have not seen thus far through our enrollment of people, as Efrain said, consider going to war plan dropping and not offering. That -- we're not seeing that behavior, we saw that last year.We saw less people opting to want to add that or seeing value in adding the insurance, but they wanted the HR and they wanted the technology and they wanted our advisory services. They went in the ASO bucket. Now we're going back to some of them that are now saying, okay, wait, now I do want to add the insurance. And now we're upgrading them to the PEO offering. So what we're seeing is, both in terms of new logo demand, some new net customers to Paychex, we're seeing strong demand in our ASO and PEO market with attachment rates in the PEO similar to what we saw prior to the '23 experience.And then the third thing that we've got going on is we're going back into this ASO of group of clients that we were -- last year, and we're going back and using analytics and using value propositions to see if we can go back and have some of those clients upgrade and add insurance as part of their value proposition. I hope that answers your question. I was not clear, James, what...James Eugene FaucetteYes. That's actually really helpful. And I guess just as -- so it sounds like for most of your employers in terms of their behavior on particularly some of those offerings is that they're kind of reverting back to what you would expect to be in a normalized environment. And really, it was last year that was really atypical?John B. GibsonYes. That's what I would say. And again, you just make stuff up. I was -- I try to remember, 2 years ago, it was the great resignation. Last year this time, the bottom was going to fall out of the economy and all -- the recession was right around the corner. Does everybody recall that? I mean it's just -- it's been a very emotional roller coaster ride for small and medium-sized businesses. And when they're making a decision of this magnitude because you're making a commitment to your employees that you're going to offer a benefit and the expectation is you're baking that into your business model going forward. And so I think there was a lot of hesitancy.Now does that mean small and medium-sized businesses are more confident today than they were last year? I don't know. But what I can tell you is we're seeing more behavior that is similar to what we've seen in historical patterns, and last year, it seems to be an anomaly. Again, I'm only 25% through the enrollment. But what I'm seeing right now, we'll know more in the next call. Let's leave it at that.At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, that's on the Paychex investor website, where we also have all these fabulous reports for your read. And again, we want to thank you for your interest in Paychex, and I hope everyone has a great day.OperatorThat concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

This compares unfavorably to the S&amp;P 500 Index for both periods of time. While the stock may not have done much recently, there is still a lot to like about the company that should warrant the attention of both growth and income investors alike.Recent Earnings ResultsPAYX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PAYXPaychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) reported first-quarter earnings results on Sept. 27. Revenue grew 7% to $1.29 billion while adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 was an improvement from $1.03 in the prior year. Numbers came in ahead of estimates, with the top-line $20 million better than expected and the adjusted earnings per share beating by 2 cents.Both segments of the company provided mid-single-digit growth. Management Solutions, the larger of the two segments, was up 6% to $955.5 million. This segment benefited from increased demand for HR Solutions. This, coupled with higher penetration of products amongst clients, led to gains in the number of clients and client employees. Better pricing also aided results.PEO &amp; Insurance Solutions improved 5% to $297.8 million as average number of worksite employees increased. Interest on funds held for clients surged 83% to $32.7 million thanks to higher interest rates.On the strength of quarterly results, Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) lifted its expected growth rate for adjusted earnings per share to 9% to 11% from 9% to 10%. Using fiscal year 2023 results, this equates to adjusted earnings per share of $4.70 for the new fiscal year. This is in-line with the companys historical annual earnings growth rate of nearly 11% over the last decade.Strong FundamentalsPaychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) regularly turns out positive results from its two main businesses, which has helped the company to have some of the best fundamentals in its industry. As a result, Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) has a GF Score of 98 out of 100, one of the highest in the market place. This score implies the potential for high returns moving forward. This score is derived from perfect scores for profitability and growth, high ratings for financial strength and momentum, and modest results for value.Story continuesPaychex: A Name for Both Growth and IncomeProfitability and EfficiencyProfitability is where Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) shines compared to its competition. The perfect score starts with the companys operating margin and net margin, which are both higher than more 95% of the nearly 1,100 companies in the Business Services industry. Return on equity and assets are equally impressive, with both showing better than 91% of the peer group.The weakest metric within profitability is return on invested capital, but this is still above more than 84% of the competition. In addition, Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX)s ROIC 18.5% compares well to its weighted average cost of capital of 10.7%, proving that the company is very efficient at using capital to generate profits.Nearly all of Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX)s current rankings for profitability are at the very high end of the companys 10-year history. The company has also been profitable each year during this period, which ranks ahead of 99.9% of the industry.Financial StrengthElsewhere, the numbers look just as good. For example, Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) has very little debt on its balance sheet, with long-term borrowings totaling less than $800 million as of the most recent earnings result. This compares to cash and equivalents of $1.65 billion. This leads to good showings for the debt related metrics. The company also has ample interest coverage thanks to its large cash balance.Dividend and Valuation AnalysisPaychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years. This includes a 12.7% increase late last April. The dividend has compounded at a rate of close to 10% over the last 10 years.The expected payout ratio for this fiscal year is 76%. This is high at face value, but would be one of the lowest ratios for the last decade. The average payout ratio over this period is 80%, so the projected payout ratio is likely in a safe range. And with earnings growth as high as it is, investors can likely expect dividend growth to continue. Shares of Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) yield 3% presently, nearly twice the average yield of 1.6% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) is trading at 24.9 times forward earnings estimates, which is a slight discount to its historical average price-earnings ratio of 26.9.Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX)s GF Value Line suggests that the stock fairly valued, but trading below its intrinsic value and offering some upside potential. Investors could see a return of 9.7% from current levels if the stock were to reach its GF Value of $128.64. Add in the dividend yield, and total returns could stretch into the low double-digit figures.Paychex: A Name for Both Growth and IncomeFinal ThoughtsPaychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX)s most recent quarter is more of the same for the company, with revenue and adjusted earnings per share growing compared to the prior year. Both were also better than the market had anticipated.

This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 1.09% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.43% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Starbucks as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Starbucks is projected to report earnings of $0.96 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18.52%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $9.23 billion, up 9.67% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.45 per share and revenue of $35.83 billion.

Rising prices, elevated energy costs, and slowing economic growth mean the one constant investors can count on is the reliability of dividend stocks to see them through. That’s why you should include Dividend Kings in your portfolio. Dividend Kings are the elite of dividend stocks. They are companies that increased their payout every year for 50 years or more. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s proof they’re not only solid businesses, but they also have a bedrock commitment to returning value to shareholders.The asset managers at Hartford Funds looked at the benchmark S&amp;P 500’s performance going all the way back to 1930. They found dividend stocks never lost money over any decade. They found that during the 50-year period between 1973 and 2022, companies that consistently raised their payout outperformed all other categories of stocks.Only 47 companies qualify as Dividend Kings. That makes it a very exclusive list. But the following seven stocks are down between 10% and 29% over the past year and should be bought on the dip.Leggett &amp; Platt (LEG) A magnifying glass is focused on the logo for Leggett &amp; Platt on the company's website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comLeggett &amp; Platt (NYSE:LEG) is the leading manufacturer of mattress and sofa innerspring coils and a major supplier of adjustable beds. Bedding accounts for 46% of revenue, but combined with flooring and automotive, the three segments represent 81% of the total. Naturally, that makes it subject to the vagaries of the housing and auto markets, both of which have been tested recently.Yet they are showing signs of resilience and stabilization. New home sales were up 4.4% in July while new car sales jumped 15% in August. Still, the spring maker lowered full-year guidance because it sees ongoing volatility in its primary end markets with no visibility into how long it will last. The stock is down 28.8% over the past year, causing its dividend yield to jump to 7%.Story continuesYet with a 52-year track record of raising its payout, Leggett &amp; Platt is a Dividend King you can sleep comfortably owning knowing it will survive the turmoil.Black Hills (BKH) multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skyline. AQN stockSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.comElectric and gas utility Black Hills (NYSE: BKH) is another relatively unknown Dividend King. Based in South Dakota, Black Hills serves 1.3 million customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming.Utility stocks are boring compared to tech stocks and biotechs, but they’re supposed to be. Investors buy them for their stability and regularity of income. Black Hills has also raised its dividend for 52 years and targets long-term growth between 4% to 6% annually.The stock is down 28.8% over the last 12 months after deemphasizing capital expenditures in favor of strengthening its balance sheet. That was a smart strategy by management, but pushed the dividend yield to 4.1%. It plans to resume infrastructure spending in 2024. Customer growth is expanding in key states and it is seeing traction in new markets, such as data centers and blockchain customers. With a depressed stock and an enviable history of dividend increases, Black Hills is one of the Dividend Kings to count on.Commerce Bancshares (CBSH) Golden light shining from crack of door on black safe with black background, representing bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/marozhka studioThe financial market was thrown into crisis after Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank (OTCMKTS: SBNY) and First Republic Bank were seized by regulators. The upheaval hit regional banks like Commerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) hard. Ratings agency Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) downgraded its credit rating, along with nine others. The stock crumbed 27.5% over the last 12 months. Although they all remain investment grade, rising interest rates forced the banks to pay more for deposits while weakening the value of their securities and loans. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate from near-zero to a high of 5.5%.Commerce Bancshares operates primarily in the Midwest. It provides a broad range of retail, mortgage banking, corporate, investment, trust, and asset management products and services to both individuals and businesses. It’s been in business for over 150 years and is one of the 50 largest banks in the U.S. based on total assets.Despite the downgrade, Commerce Bancshares remains solid. Its Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of how well capitalized a bank is in the event of an economic downturn, is 14.75%. That puts it among the best of the biggest banks based on assets.Commerce Bancshares has raised its dividend for 54 years and counting and the payout yields 2.2% annually. It’s a company you can bank on weathering the storm.Target (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comDiscount retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) was a pandemic darling whose stock rocketed 80% higher over the two-year period of 2020 to 2021. Since then shares are down 47% and they’ve lost 25.6% of their value in the last year alone.An excess of stimulus check spending fueled the Covid boom. Lockdown consumers went on a “revenge shopping” spending spree. Unfortunately, Target misjudged trends and ended up with significant excess inventory. Skyrocketing inflation also caused consumers to become more cautious about spending money.Target also waded into the culture wars with an LGBTQ marketing campaign targeting children. The consumer backlash was swift and quarterly sales fell for the first time in six years. Where the retailer once was an exemplary e-commerce powerhouse, online sales tumbled over 10%. Total sales were down 5% in this year’s second quarter.Yet Target looks back on track. Inventory is under control again and full-year earnings are tracking higher than the pandemic bubble. Target’s raised its dividend for 54 years and the 3.6% yield is a lucrative enticement to a depressed stock.Hormel (HRL) Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo.

The stock is down 16.8% over the past year.But this is a passing issue. In its just completed third quarter, Hormel reported volume sales increases across all segments, but especially in turkey, and it continues to reduce inventories to historic levels.Hormel is an international company and China plays an important role. Ongoing softness there led to a 6% drop in international sales. Management had forecast a quicker, stronger recovery to China’s economy, but president and CEO Jim Snee told analysts, “we were wrong.” Hormel is still expecting regrowth, but it’s weighing on performance at the moment.In the meantime, investors can find solace in Hormel’s dividend. It’s made a payout since going public in 1928 and has raised the dividend every year for the last 57 years. The dividend yields 2.8% annually.Northwest Natural (NWN) Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockAnother electric utility, Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN) provides natural gas utility services to the northwestern states of Oregon and Washington. It also provides water service in Texas and Arizona. It’s been in business since 1859 and has paid a dividend for over 70 years. It is also the one Dividend King on this list that has the longest unbroken string of dividend increases, some 67 consecutive years. Yet the stock is down 15.4% for the last 12 months.That’s because Northwest Natural is under pressure from inflation. Unlike other businesses, utilities cannot simply raise prices to meet rising costs. They need to go through regulators for rate increases. While rates generally do rise in relation to expenses, whether from higher input costs or those necessary to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, it’s a lagging tailwind. The utility’s margins have been under pressure.Having hit its lowest levels in nearly a decade, Northwest Natural’s stock is on the rise again. Shares are 10% off their lows. Expect them to keep rising. As populations rise in its service markets, the utility will add more customers, increasing revenue and profits.Tootsie Roll Industries (TR)A close-up shot of Tootsie Roll (TR) candies.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.comConfectioner Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) is not so much unknown, as it is unpopular. Trading volumes are extremely low, averaging only 175,000 shares daily. In contrast, Hershey (NYSE:HSY) trades about 1.2 million shares a day and Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) does 6.2 million.The stock is also heavily shorted with days to cover standing at 7.9. That’s the time it would take short sellers to cover their position. Anything over seven days is a lot. Founded only two years after Hershey in 1896, Tootsie Roll has been majority-owned by the Gordon family since the 1930s. That gives Tootsie Roll stability, but it is also a liability of sorts. Where Hershey expanded into healthy snacks, the Gordons prefer to just keep making candy. There’s something to be said for sticking to your knitting, but chocolate consumption is declining. The National Confectioners Association says units sales fell 4.2% in 2022 and volume was 2.6% lower. The stock is down 11.3% in the past year.With the Gordons in their 90s, there is the likelihood of change. That could spur new growth and ignite the stock once more.Sysco (SYY) Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockFood distributor Sysco (NYSE:SYY) leads the industry with a 17% share of a highly fragmented market. It operates 334 distribution facilities globally and serves approximately 725,000 customer locations. Like many of the companies in this list, Sysco feels the heat applied by inflation and high commodity costs. The Dept. of Labor said food and energy drove inflation to its biggest monthly increase this year in August.Sysco’s sales, volume, and profits were all higher in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in July. For the full year, the company generated sales of more than $76 billion and operating income is at record highs. Earnings per share soared 45% over last year while adjusted earnings were up 16.5% from the year ago period.CEO Kevin Hourican told analysts the tailwinds Sysco is experiencing comes from healthcare, education, travel, and hospitality where it is “winning market share profitably in those sectors.”Sysco has a 53-year record of raising its dividend that currently yields 2.8%. It’s a stock that will deliver for investors over the long haul.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in LEG, NWN, TR, and SYY stock.

148,696d4d0d-5570-3ad9-9eae-a42d0b4f7d5a,ADM,2023-09-28,15 Biggest Agricultural Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-agricultural-companies-us-205552537.html,1695761752,STORY,"['TSN', 'BG', 'MOS', 'ADM', 'AGCO', 'FMC', 'SEB', 'CTVA']","[In this article, we shall cover the 15 biggest agricultural companies in the US. To skip our detailed analysis of some of the risks and potentials affecting the American agricultural industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Biggest Agricultural Companies in the US.According to an outlook presented by the US Department of Agriculture in 2023, the US agricultural GDP is expected to reach up to $173 billion by 2026, up 0.6% annually since 2021. The market is estimated to have grown more than 2% year-on-year since 2002. Some of the  biggest agricultural companies in the American market today are Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN).Despite such impressive statistics, a recent article by McKinsey posits that even the biggest agricultural companies in the US are currently under immense pressure. Across the world, farmers complain that prices for agricultural input like fertilizer and crop protection chemicals are at an all-time high, currently rising by more than 250% over the past couple of years. Moreover, the exacerbation of the climate change crisis is introducing further problems, as rising temperatures are leading to increased weather variability, more frequent acute conditions, longer periods of drought, and new species of invasive crops and pests, all of which collectively is significantly reducing annual yields. In the American Southwest, for example, there is a massive drought underway for the past 20 years, and experts have claimed that the the 21st century has been the region's driest time period in at least 1200 years.Agricultural Automation Trends: An OverviewAccording to McKinsey, to release the increasing pressure on the agricultural industry in 2023 and to maintain economic viability, farmers are resorting to innovative, technological solutions. In this vein, automation is showing significant promise in curtailing the effects of the climate crisis and aiding agriculturalists mitigate the resulting financial blow. Automated farming solutions tend to exist on a diverse spectrum, ranging from semi-automated technologies like assisted steering to entirely automated systems like weeding robots, each requiring varying levels of operator support. The next generation of automated technology is using a combination of sensors, analytics, robotics, and equipment to help farmers make more informed decisions on the field and capitalize on all available resources. Furthermore, the advent of artificial intelligence presents significant potential to automate decision-making using comprehensive sets of already-attained data points. Automated technology presents significant upside to row and specialty crop producers. For example, the use of automated systems in agriculture presents an upside of more than $400 per acre per year, nearly quadrupling returns on farmers’ investments. Therefore, some of the biggest agricultural companies in the US like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN) have already begun a process of integrating and incorporating automated technological solutions to their operations.Story continuesHowever, according to McKinsey's Farmers Global Insights Survey 2022, less than 5 percent of farmers in North America are adequately investing in next generation technology. In the survey, McKinsey also highlights certain trends prevalent in the agricultural sector in 2023 which are likely to propel the adoption of automated technology in agricultural practice.A trend which is almost immediately evident is that farm economics are a constant source of trepidation for farmers. Automation can aid primarily in two fundamental respects. Firstly, since supply chain disruptions and geopolitical challenges have caused the prices of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals to skyrocket by more than 15% globally over five years, US farmers have begun to cite input costs as the number one risk to their profitability, according to the survey. To read more about the price hike in the fertilizer segment of the agriculture industry, check out our article on 10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Secondly, labor challenges are also proving to be a constant pain point for farmers, especially since farmworkers are at high risk of injuries and have one of the highest fatal occupational injury rates in the United States. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to chemicals and sun also adds to the perception that farm work is inherently dangerous. These labor shortages - especially in the United States where more than 22 million pounds of fruits and vegetables were wasted in 2022 due to worker shortage - have caused farmworker wages to rise by roughly four percent annually between 2015 to 2022. Automation can help ease these challenges significantly.Digitization in Agriculture: A Sustainable ApproachAccording to an article by McKinsey, agricultural land covers more than half of habitable land around the world and is responsible for more than seventy percent of freshwater withdrawal. Furthermore, food systems are the leading cause of biodiversity loss and have increasingly begun to negatively impact biosphere integrity, human health, and food access. In 2019, the global agriculture industry accounted for more than thirty percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, making them a critical focus for meeting bold climate targets. Hence, as the climate crisis assumes a higher priority for governments globally, investors are increasingly focused on companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN), which have begun to implement sustainable transitions to curb agriculture's effects on nature and society beyond climate change.According to the article, achieving the objective of a 1.5° pathway will require actions by the biggest agricultural companies that extend throughout the value chain. Some of the more important actions to take are reducing food loss and waste, adopting dietary shifts, and adapting to a more sustainable usage of arable land, all of which are absolutely integral to decarbonization efforts. According to an article by Bloomberg, digital services have a strong interconnection with sustainability efforts in agriculture. As the public eye increasingly focuses on the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector, digital service providers are flocking in to market their platform's sustainability capabilities. The article posits that as farmers use digital services to monitor the administration of fertilizer, crop chemicals, and water, the efficiency of the entire process is substantially enhanced, thereby reducing the impact on emissions and ecology.In this effort, Bloomberg conducted a survey of digital platform owners, who maintained that digital monitoring of farming is essential to prove at scale the certification of regenerative farming practices that enhance soil health, organic carbon in the soil, and biodiversity promotion. Digitization of the farming process can also ensure supply chain transparency to promote sustainability and outcome-based pricing models, which incentivize a profound reduction in the use of agrochemicals.Vegetable FarmingPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 15 biggest agricultural companies companies in the U.S, we decided to look at a mix of both private and public companies.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).ADM currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.83, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.83 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy, representing 58.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ADMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ADMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for ADM here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying ADM, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is ADM a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for ADM, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.18.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ADM. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for ADM.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Removing exposure from high-risk stocks and tilting them toward high-growth potential or defensive stocks ensures capital growth and preservation. And it paves the way to a more comfortable retirement. With potential recession news, continued high inflation, growing oil prices, and higher-than-average interest rates, it’s best to look at defensive sectors.For example, utilities, healthcare, and non-cyclical industries cushion investor portfolios because these businesses are staples regardless of economic cycles. They are considered safe and steady haven assets during times of uncertainty.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s explore this environment with these three defensive stocks for questionable times ahead.United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR)In this photo illustration United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR) logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comFirst choice is a pharmaceutical company, United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR).The company is best known for its development in treatments for cardiovascular disorders like arterial hypertension and infectious diseases. UTHR is well-known for being a public benefit corporation due to its mission of helping people live healthier lives and improving the healthcare system.Besides UTHR’s company values and mission, it also boasts double-digit revenue growth and reached its highest quarterly revenue in most recently. Its total revenues grew 28% year over year (YOY) to $596.5 million. The company also beat EPS analyst estimates by 18.82%.With its continued growth and sustainability-leaning values, it’s no surprise that other long-term investors see it as one of the best defensive stocks worth holding.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM)On a white table sits bowls of nuts, fruit, and seeds, while vegetables like brocolli, carrots, and mushrooms sit on the tableSource: Tatjana Baibakova / ShutterstockArcher-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is a world leader in nutrition that runs food processing services in agriculture, carbohydrate solutions, and nutrition segments.Story continuesAlso, the company has the largest oilseed business and corn processing company. ADM is well-known to income investors as a Dividend King, thanks to it’s 50 years of dividend increases. The company’s payouts can help stabilize portfolios regardless of the economic state.Once again, Archer-Daniels-Midland has delivered excellent earnings results, with Q2 earnings beating analyst estimates by 18.87%. Although the company’s Carbohydrates Solutions segment delivered notable results, sales numbers fell short from last year.Furthermore, its business segments of agricultural storage and transportation grew significantly this year, presenting a possible investment area for the company. Despite the slightly lackluster performance, ADM’s Dividend King status makes it worth la second look. And with the growing global population and increasing demands, ADM investors may be looking at a bright future.Consolidated Water (CWCO)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comLast on the defensive stocks list is a company that recently received a massive spike in its price performance. Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. (NASDAQ:CWCO) is a water utility company offering advanced water treatment, supply, and distribution.CWCO supplies water to its clients in the U.S., Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, and Cayman Islands. They focus operations on the desalinization of seawater, followed by its distribution to customers in areas without accessible potable water.Consolidated Water reported a record quarterly performance of revenue growth by 110% YOY, and EPS beat expectations by 113.64%. CWCO is optimistic about continued growth as Grand Cayman continues to push towards recovery and its continuous project bidding for multi-year U.S. contracts. Investors have been quick to jump on CWCO while it’s been cheap. In turn, this brought its stock price up from ending 2022 at $14.80 to trading at $31 on September 15, 2023.A utility company with excellent prospects is worth holding onto for the long term.On the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Synopsys (SNPS) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 15.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 24.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.7%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Synopsys is 25.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 13.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineSynopsys has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Synopsys is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The chart below showcases the annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc: A Comprehensive Analysis of its Dividend PerformanceDecoding Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's Dividend Yield and GrowthCurrently, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.19% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.52%.

Based on the company's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc stock is approximately 3.19% as of today.Story continuesHost Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc: A Comprehensive Analysis of its Dividend PerformanceAssessing Dividend Sustainability: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityThe sustainability of a dividend can be gauged by examining the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio reveals the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.48.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's profitability rank provides an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. As of 2023-06-30, GuruFocus ranks Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's profitability 6 out of 10, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 8 years out of the past 10 years.Future Outlook: Examining Growth MetricsA company must have robust growth metrics to ensure the sustainability of dividends. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's revenue has increased by approximately -2.90% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 67.92% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc's earnings increased by approximately -11.30% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 71.96% of global competitors.ConclusionWhile Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc has a consistent dividend payment history, its growth rate and profitability rank present a mixed picture. The company's payout ratio suggests a good balance between dividend payments and retained earnings. However, the negative growth rates in revenue and earnings per share indicate potential challenges in sustaining dividends in the long run. Therefore, investors should carefully consider these factors before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The aviation sector is anticipated to be the hardest hit, with the possibility of essential workers being required to work without pay.Yahoo Finance Live is joined by Boyd Group International President Mike Boyd to discuss the implications for consumer travel and the challenges that may arise for the Federal Aviation Administration.""Overall, it's just going to accelerate a decline in the efficiency of our air transportation system... also issues of oversight of airlines, oversight of airports, oversight of manufacturers and components,"" Boyd says. ""That's where the real sand might get into the works.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: A government shutdown would have dramatic implications for the US travel economy, with some estimates putting the hit at around $140 billion a day. The aviation sector is a key focus. While many essential staff like air traffic controllers are expected to report for duty without pay, workers calling in sick could be an issue yet again.We want to bring in Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. And, Mike, lay this out for us because estimates are all over the place and exactly what a government shutdown-- the impact that is going to have on the travel industry. What's your view?MIKE BOYD: Well, I think initially, air travel will be just as inconvenient as ever. We have understaffed air traffic control systems right now and the employees know they're going to get paid eventually. The real issue is long term.And it's not just things like training. [? Buddha Air ?] brought that up. That really won't come into play. What really will come into play is the day-to-day regulation that the FAA has over airports, airlines, and also aircraft manufacturers, where Boeing won't be able to get that inspector to take a look at that new system they want approved on an airport. And Eastern Wyoming won't be able to get an FAA inspector to come and look at the New runway. Over a period of time that could have a hit.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Would this also impact some infrastructure projects, especially, given the environmental reviews permitting that would be disrupted and some of these infrastructure projects taking place in or around or at airports?MIKE BOYD: It would. In the near term it certainly wouldn't have much of an effect because it's only going to be several days probably. But nevertheless, in terms of hurting the environment, that's not going to be the case. I don't think, per se. It'll just-- you shut down the whole air transportation system, that's a lot less jet fuel going into the air.But nevertheless, the bottom line of the whole thing is the FAA is in a situation right now where it needs to get reorganized and revisited. We've got new electric airplanes coming along line that are really heading for a brick wall regulation wise. We really can't take these people off of those jobs because thats critically important. You and I don't see that. But in five years-- in five weeks, five months, we probably will.SEANA SMITH: Mike, what about the traveler's behavior? Do we typically see people maybe canceling their trips if we see a government shutdown?MIKE BOYD: I think people that don't really look into it, probably would assume, yes, if the government shuts down, my airplane might shut down. Let's not go see grandma right now. There'll be some of that. But I think overall at least if this doesn't last more than a couple of-- more than a week or so, we're not going to see a whole lot of anything.I don't see a walkout. I don't see people calling in sick. These controllers and TSA people, they know they're going to get paid. It's just going to be a little late paycheck and there might be something after accelated when it comes.BRAD SMITH: Certainly, and that was the case back in 2019, where we did see absenteeism on the rise, especially, after that two week period because of delayed paychecks. Now, what kind of impact would that mean for the airline operators should we get to that point?MIKE BOYD: Well, right now, today, our air traffic control system has been a wonderfully bipartisan, mismanaged thing over the last 20 years. So I don't think we're going to see anything missing right now. But overall, it's just going to accelerate a decline in the efficiency of our air transportation system, mainly because of the ATC system. But also issues of oversight of airlines, oversight of airports, oversight of manufacturers and components, that that's where the real sand might get into the works.BRAD SMITH: And, so, as you were mentioning earlier, it also impacts the safety checks therein. So what type of resumption would we be talking about thereafter?MIKE BOYD: Well, I don't think we'll see anything with safety. Look, the airline industry today, they know that safety is really expensive. So you're not going to have that problem. But getting back on, we bring up a real good point.When you shut something down, getting it back. Getting that FAA inspector back to take a look at that new system that a component manufacturer is putting together might take weeks. So it'll delay a lot of things and will hurt some companies. There's no question about it because it won't be able to produce the systems they want to produce or develop them, that sort of thing.It could be again-- that's where you got these billions of dollars and millions of dollars a hit-- it's not people getting on the airplane at gate seven at LaGuardia.BRAD SMITH: All right, Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. Mike, always a pleasure to get some of your insights and analysis around this. We'll hope that we don't get to that point. But you may be getting another call from us.MIKE BOYD: I'd love to. Thank you, sir.]"

Excluding a total 2023 adjustment of $0.77 per share and an adverse currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of $0.50 per share, this forecast continues to represent a projected increase of 8.0% to 9.5% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98 in 2022, as outlined above.""Our excellent momentum continues, with further strong IQOS performance, resilient combustible trends and better-than-expected growth for ZYN,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer. ""We now expect third-quarter currency-neutral bottom-line growth to exceed our July forecast – a strong performance that almost fully offsets the increased currency headwind, allowing us to target the lower end of our $1.60 to $1.65 prior forecast range for adjusted diluted EPS.""The $0.17 increase in the estimated unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, is due to a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a range of currencies, as well as a balance-sheet-related currency impact in Argentina, which accounted for approximately one-third of the increase. While the company’s affiliate in Argentina remains subject to highly inflationary accounting treatment, with the U.S. dollar treated as the functional currency, the impact reflects the depreciation of Argentine peso-denominated monetary net assets, which are subject to capital controls.The assumptions underlying this forecast remain unchanged versus those communicated by PMI in its earnings release of July 20, 2023, with the exception of the following revisions:Full-year HTU shipment volume around the middle of the company’s 125-to-130-billion-unit range, including the impact of a later-than-expected market launch in Taiwan and very limited growth in Russia and Ukraine. The range also reflects some uncertainty related to inventory levels in the Europe Region, as trade partners adjust to the upcoming HTU flavor ban in the EU;Full-year nicotine pouch shipment volume of 370 to 400 million cans;Operating cash flow of around $10 billion at prevailing exchange rates, subject to year-end working capital requirements, with the change versus the prior range of $10 to $11 billion primarily reflecting the unfavorable estimated currency impact on net earnings;A third-quarter unfavorable currency impact on adjusted diluted EPS of $0.17 per share, at prevailing exchange rates;Adjusted diluted EPS toward the lower end of the $1.60 to $1.65 prior forecast range, reflecting the incremental currency impact almost fully offset by better-than-anticipated business performance;Third-quarter HTU shipment volume around the middle of the company’s 31-to-33-billion-unit range, including typical seasonality in IQOS user and market share growth trends; andThird-quarter adjusted OI margin that is broadly stable organically versus the prior year period and up sequentially versus the second quarter.Third-Quarter2023Forecast2022CurrencyVar. excl.Curr.Reported Diluted EPS$ 1.56–$ 1.61$ 1.34$ (0.17)29%-33%Amort. and impairment of intangibles (a)0.040.08Costs assoc. w/ Swedish Match AB offer--0.11Adjusted Diluted EPS$ 1.60–$ 1.65$ 1.53$ (0.17)16%-19%(a) Includes a non-cash impairment charge of $0.06 per share in 2022Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.2024-2026 Targets &amp; AssumptionsThe company communicates the following key targets related to the three-year period from 2024 to 2026:Positive total shipment volume compound annual growth;Annual HTU shipment volume of 180 to 200 billion units in 2026;Annual nicotine pouch shipment volume of 800 million to 1 billion cans in 2026;Net revenue compound annual growth of 6% to 8% on an organic basis;Adjusted OI compound annual growth of 8% to 10% on an organic basis;Adjusted diluted EPS compound annual growth of 9% to 11%, excluding currency;Gross manufacturing productivities of $1 billion and SG&amp;A efficiencies of $1 billion;$36 to $39 billion in total operating cash flow over the three-year period at prevailing exchange rates; andAdjusted net debt to EBITDA of around 2-times by the end of 2026 at prevailing exchange rates.The company communicates the following key assumptions related to the three-year period from 2024 to 2026:Excise tax developments consistent with recent trends and current multi-year tax plans;Mid-single-digit annual combustible tobacco pricing variance as a percentage of prior year net revenues and moderate net pricing on HTUs;Double-digit compound annual growth in net revenues and adjusted OI for the company’s U.S. operations, including the impact of IQOS investments;Limited growth in Wellness and Healthcare segment net revenues and no increase in investment levels in the segment;No contribution from any potential favorable court ruling related to the legality of a supplemental tax surcharge on HTUs in Germany;Higher net financing costs;Current corporate income tax rates, excluding any potential impact of the OECD Pillar One and Pillar Two international tax proposals;$3.5 to $3.7 billion in total capital expenditures over the three-year period, with ~75% related to smoke-free products;No share repurchases reflected in the growth targets for the period.Capital AllocationSubject to the discretion of the Board of Directors:The company will maintain its progressive dividend policy while targeting a long-term dividend payout ratio of around 75% of adjusted diluted EPS;The company could consider share repurchases once confirmed that it is fully on-track for 2-times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target.Forward-Looking and Cautionary StatementsThis press release contains projections of future results and goals and other forward-looking statements, including statements regarding business and regulatory plans, expectations, opportunities, ambitions, targets, and strategies. These forward-looking statements and anticipated results reflect the current views and assumptions of management and are inherently subject to significant risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.PMI’s business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; the impact and consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; changes in adult smoker behavior; the impact of COVID-19 on PMI’s business; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI’s future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent, including women or diverse candidates; or if it is unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from recent transactions and acquisitions. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category’s performance.PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including PMI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of June 30, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 80 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.4 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35.4% of PMI’s total second-quarter 2023 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Philip Morris International's ROIC is 21.5 while its WACC came in at 7.01.The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Philip Morris International is shown below:Unveiling Philip Morris International's True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn summary, the stock of Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) is believed to be modestly undervalued.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.02%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.22%.Coming into today, shares of the shopping mall real estate investment trust had lost 3.86% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector lost 1.61%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.86%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Simon Property as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Simon Property to post earnings of $2.98 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 0.34%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.37 billion, up 3.95% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.91 per share and revenue of $5.52 billion. These totals would mark changes of +0.34% and +4.33%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Simon Property. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

176,f8121205-257a-318a-8fcb-3a5c262a7a5f,SPG,2023-09-28,Is It Wise to Retain Simon Property (SPG) Stock Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wise-retain-simon-property-spg-152200090.html,1695828120,STORY,['SPG'],"[Amid the recovery of the retail real estate industry, Simon Property Group’s SPG portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad, the adoption of omnichannel retailing and balance sheet strength position it well for growth.This retail REIT behemoth enjoys wide exposure to retail assets across the United States. Additionally, its presence in international markets is likely to encourage sustainable long-term growth compared with its domestically focused peers.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. It is also focused on tapping growth opportunities by helping digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Further, SPG’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work, play, stay and shop. Going forward, an improving leasing environment is likely to benefit this retail REIT’s properties at premium locations. We expect the company’s 2023 total revenues to improve 2.6% year over year.In the first half of 2023, it signed 615 new leases and 1,070 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio. Also, it has a significant number of leases lined up and continues to see solid broad-based demand from the retail community across several categories.As of Jun 30, 2023, the occupancy for the U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio came in at 94.7%, up 80 basis points from 93.9% as of Jun 30, 2022. We project the same to be 95.1% at year-end 2023.To enhance its portfolio, Simon Property has been focusing on premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments and has invested billions in transforming its properties. Moreover, the company capitalized on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. With the brands generating a decent amount from digital sales, investments in them seem strategic for SPG.Simon Property also maintains a solid balance sheet position with ample liquidity. This enabled the company to exit second-quarter 2023 with $8.8 billion of liquidity.As of Jun 30, 2023, Simon Property’s total secured debt to total assets was 18%, while the fixed-charge coverage ratio was 4.5, ahead of the required level. The company also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it remains well-poised to tide over any mayhem and bank on growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for REIT investors, and Simon Property is committed to boosting shareholder wealth. During the pandemic, while several REITs suspended dividend payments in light of the pandemic that disrupted the macro economy and affected rent collections, Simon Property continued with its dividend payment though at a reduced rate.Later, the company announced dividend hikes, with the most recent one being declared concurrent with the second quarter of 2023 earnings release, whereby the company increased the dividend payment to $1.90 per share from $1.85 paid out earlier. This marked a hike of 2.7% from the prior dividend payment. This retail REIT has increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years. This spate of dividend increases brings additional relief to investors and reaffirms confidence in this retail landlord.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 5.5% in the past six months against its industry’s decline of 1.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. However, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to continue to be a popular choice among customers. Consequently, this might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and affect retail REITs, including Simon Property.Moreover, amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-interest-rate environment, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent.A high-interest-rate environment is a concern for Simon Property. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its share of total debt as of Jun 30, 2023 was approximately $31.5 billion.Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses implies a rise of 7.8% year over year. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts due to high interest rates.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Phillips Edison &amp; Company PECO and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Phillips Edison’s current-year FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past two months to $2.32.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tanger Factory’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $1.89.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is also supplying its PPG CORACHAR™ fire protection coating to protect the vehicle’s lithium (Li)-ion battery pack. The Stella Terra has been designed to withstand the harsh conditions of off-roading, and in October the team will depart for Morocco, where it will undergo extensive testing, including in the Sahara desert.""A risk of Li-ion batteries is that they can experience thermal runaway,"" said Wisse Bos, team manager of Solar Team Eindhoven. ""While the probability of this failure occurring is rather slim, we decided to partner with PPG to minimize the effects of such a severe accident. PPG’s cutting-edge innovations on battery coatings make it possible for Terra’s drivers and its surroundings to evacuate in a worst-case scenario by stalling the spread of a battery fire.""PPG CoraChar battery fire protection coatings are intumescent – they expand in the presence of high heat or fire – to provide an insulating layer to protect from thermal damage. The coatings cover a wide range of applications and leverage PPG’s experience with industrial and commercial fire protection, improve light-weighting, increasing battery performance, and supporting passenger and first-responder safety in case of a fire.Story continues""The project supports PPG’s goals of developing sustainably advantaged technologies and supporting sustainability education,"" said Thierry Destruhaut, PPG customer sustainability business partner, Automotive OEM Coatings.

PPG has announced an exclusive supplier agreement with Flo-Optics, a developer of digital manufacturing technology for the ophthalmic market, for the use of PPG HI-GARD scratch-resistant coatings with Flo's digital printing technology.The collaboration would enable the first digital lens coating solutions utilizing additive manufacturing, referred to as 3D printing. The approach will allow ophthalmic labs to precisely apply lens coatings for a customizable production procedure for lenses with unique performance characteristics. In addition to making lenses more functional, the technology makes the coating more efficient by reducing material consumption, lowering production energy requirements and providing faster turnaround times than standard application methods.Flo's digital coatings technology uses multimaterial and multilayering processes to improve customization and automation choices, reduce production complexity, increase scalability and deliver consistent quality. PPG Hi-Gard lens coating solutions give a long-lasting, scratch-resistant coating on plastic lens materials used in ophthalmic lenses. Plastic lenses retain their optical quality, and lenses coated with Hi-Gard lens coating are four to six times more abrasion-resistant than untreated lenses.Shares of PPG have gained 13.5% over the past year compared with a 16.7% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company expects third-quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1.85-$1.95. For the full year, the company raised its adjusted EPS projection to the range of $7.28-$7.48. These projections consider various factors such as current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries.The company expects performance coatings demand in Europe to stabilize at lower levels than the pre-conflict period in Ukraine while raw material and transportation normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels.For Industrial coatings, PPG anticipates a low single-digit percentage decline in organic sales due to lower global industrial production, except for modest growth in China.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the business development sector and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best BDC Stocks To Buy For the Rest of 2023. Business Development Companies, or BDCs, are a type of financial institution in the US that primarily provide capital and financing to small and mid-sized businesses. These companies mainly raise capital from investors through the issuance of shares and then invest in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities of private companies, with a focus on supporting growth and expansion.Because of rising inflation, many investors are increasingly interested in BDCs. These companies distribute at least 90% of the interest they earn as cash dividends, similar to how real-estate investment trusts operate. However, BDCs may experience losses on the principal amount they lent to the troubled businesses, which can directly reduce the value of their investments. This was seen during the pandemic of 2020 when businesses had a tough time bouncing back after lockdowns. Instead of giving out new loans, BDCs concentrated on helping the businesses they'd already invested in, which were in danger of not being able to pay back their loans. This led to a sharp drop in the stock prices of some major BDCs in the early months of 2020, with values falling by almost half, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. To assist them, the U.S. government provided temporary relief measures to make it easier for these companies to keep lending during that challenging period.In addition to their dividends, BDCs are also favored by investors because of their potential long-term returns. Duane Batcheler, a research analyst at BDCBuzz.com, spoke with Forbes about BDCs and suggested that these companies might be a good choice for tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. Here are some comments from the analyst:Story continues“Investors can benefit from the compounding returns on aggressive income-producing [instruments like BDCs]. As long as you keep them in a tax-advantaged account, you won’t owe annual taxes on any income they produce. That means these returns [could be] compounding and growing your portfolio faster, assuming you choose carefully.”Rising interest rates can be beneficial for the BDC sector as this can lead to higher yields on the debt investments held by the companies. This can potentially boost their income and profitability, as they earn more interest income from their portfolio companies. However, analysts believe that the ideal situation for this sector is when interest rates are sufficiently high, but not so high that they create financial difficulties for the economy. The S&amp;P BDC Index, which tracks the performance of leading business development companies that trade on major U.S. exchanges, delivered a 9.85% return to shareholders since the start of 2023, slightly underperforming the broader market, which has advanced 12.13% this year so far. The average market value of the companies in the index is about $1.4 billion.Because BDCs offer steady dividends, investors are increasingly interested in dividend stocks to increase their earnings. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the most popular dividend stocks among investors because of their long dividend growth track records.

Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down Blankfein's commentary and the outlook for the Fed's monetary policy.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Now let's get to your market commentary of the day. Former Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein believes that the US Central bank probably will not need to keep interest rates higher for longer. He says that inflation is successfully near the high twos, and you don't need 5.5% interest rates.Now Brad, interesting timing because we heard from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon saying that not necessarily expecting a 7% handle when it comes to rates, but saying that maybe this is something that investors should keep on their radar and exactly what that would potentially do to the markets and the impact here on the economy. But more so what I think is interesting is Blankfein coming out and saying this after we heard from Fed Chair Jay Powell last week and some of the more aggressive and hawkish commentary that we got from the dot plot, just signaling the fact that the Fed is expecting to need to stay higher for longer in order to finish that last mile battle against inflation.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Yeah. Channeling some Jordan Belfort energy, saying, hey, we're not going anywhere, we're not finished yet. But that's not what the markets wanted to hear last week. And you saw that in the equity market reaction. But in terms of what you're hearing from two very powerful names that have the propensity to move markets in Diamond earlier this week and now Blankfein as well. And given the former role that he had as CEO of Goldman, what he says still matters very much.So the quote here that kind sticks out to me, ""inflation is probably within the threes, let's say you successfully get it to the high twos,"" which has been among the commentary that we've heard from many economists. If you were able to get inflation down to the high twos, would the Fed be satisfied with the policy and the decisions that they've been able to enact? Now of course, there's going to be a lot of lag to actually seeing that take place. So that's important to note here.But Blankfein also adding in saying that you don't need 5.5% interest rates at that point when inflation is relatively subdued. So we will see what further activity the Fed feels like it needs to enact if we are able to indeed get to the high 2's and then perhaps have a slow and steady trend down to that eventual 2% or what type of activity that the Fed might or the tenor that might kind of overwhelm the conversation even if we were to get to that high two range.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly Blankfein also went on to say that this cycle could be different. And he still thinks that there's a chance that we're going to be able to avoid a recession. We a soft landing has pretty much been the base case there for many forecasters over the last several months. But coming off some of the hawkish comments from Powell, last week there has been a bit of a reassessment just in terms of whether or not a soft landing is still possible or if a recession is almost more likely at this point. But Blankfein striking the optimistic tone saying that he still thinks a soft landing can be done, and he's confident in it. So we'll see. Only time is going to tell.]"

The second year of the study built on the long-term research from Cardiff University neuroscientists exploring doll play in children, commissioned by Barbie®EL SEGUNDO, Calif., September 28, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) announced that a team of neuroscientists at Cardiff University and Barbie have released the latest findings from a multi-year study exploring the short and long-term developmental impacts of doll play. In the study’s third year, researchers have found that doll play could benefit children with varying social communication styles, including those who display neurodivergent traits commonly associated with autism.This press release features multimedia.

The results from the third year reinforce this finding across children with and without high levels of autistic traits, albeit through their different approaches to play.""Our study shows that doll play can encourage social processing in children, regardless of their neurodevelopmental profile. The findings show that all children, even those who display neurodivergent traits commonly associated with autism, may use doll play as a tool for practicing social scenarios and developing social skills, such as empathy,"" said lead researcher and neuroscientist Dr. Sarah Gerson.The team of neuroscientists used state-of-the-art functional, near-infrared spectroscopy equipment to explore brain activation while children played with dolls and on tablets, both by themselves and with another person, replicating conditions from Year 1.While observing children, researchers saw increased brain activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) region when playing with dolls, for both play with a social partner and during solo doll play, but less so during solo tablet play. The pSTS region is heavily involved in and active during social and emotional processing. The findings showed that doll play activates brain regions associated with social information processing such as empathy, indicating that doll play may enable children to rehearse, use and perform these skills even when playing independently. Interestingly, this effect in the brain was similar between children displaying fewer and greater traits commonly associated with autism.The study's results suggest that doll play could support social processing, regardless of a child’s neurodevelopmental profile, but through different pathways. For children displaying fewer autistic traits, talking about others' mental states related to pSTS activity (i.e., language about others’ thoughts and emotions when playing alone with dolls). In contrast, for those displaying more autistic traits, talking with others during doll play was related to pSTS activity, even when playing by themselves (i.e., general social engagement with researchers/experimenters rather than a specific type of talking about mental states).The Year 3 findings from Cardiff University indicate that children, regardless of their neurodevelopmental profile, can play with and potentially benefit from play with dolls in terms of their social development. Other research has shown that social processing and empathy skills are important determinants in children’s future emotional, academic, and social success.Dr. Catherine Jones said: ""The study reinforces how it is important that we acknowledge and value neurodiversity. This means recognising and valuing the diverse ways in which children's brains work and approaching social development in a way that is inclusive and accommodating for all children, regardless of their neurodivergence. By embracing all ways that children choose to play, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for their development.""Since the landmark publication of Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, the effects of play have been thought to be positive for kids’ social skills and creativity, but this has never been scientifically evidenced at the brain level. This multi-year long-term study commissioned by Barbie is the first time that key Piaget theories on play have been scientifically evidenced via brain imaging and the first to use neuroimaging evidence with natural doll play, meaning there was no prescribed storyline to show how the brain is activated during doll play.""We are proud to know that when children, regardless of their neurodevelopmental profile, play with Barbie, their playtime may benefit their development,"" said Michael Swaisland, Head of Insight and Analytics EMEA, Mattel. ""As Barbie continues to inspire the limitless potential in every child, we are delighted to know, through neuroscience, that playing with Barbie may encourage the development of social skills such as empathy in children, including those who display neurodivergent traits commonly associated with autism.

Mattel shares are up in early trading as Morgan Stanley initiated an ""overweight"" rating on the stock.Yahoo Finance Live discusses the future of the company after the success of Barbie. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: We got to switch gears and talk about Barbie. You know this is my favorite Barbie hype, maybe fading though. Mattel, however, keeping on top of trends in the toy company's shares. You're seeing them up by about 4% on the day. This comes after Morgan Stanley called the stock a top pick and gave it an overweight rating here.Mattel also announced that it would be releasing a new AI version of the guessing game Pictionary. I wish there was an Allen Iverson version of this, but it's not. It's artificial intelligence. It would have been good. The first board game that will integrate AI technology into how gamers can play here. It's been all Barbie this year. But Mattel also, of course, across their entire gaming suite needing to make sure that they're keeping up with the latest technology here.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. I mean, it's just been incredible when you take into account what has happened with Mattel over the last 12, 18 months when we first started talking about the Barbie movie, talking about what it could potentially mean for the business, and seeing how much of a success Barbie has been, and what that could mean here for the future of Mattel. When you talk about the focus here that Morgan Stanley expects and even what Mattel executives have talked about just about leveraging and monetizing their vast IP extensions here.We talk about the IP extensions. Reports and talks of 14 more movies that are in development with Hot Wheels. You have Matchbox cars, Major Matt Mason movie. The list goes on and on and on. And this is a real catalyst here for the company going forward, is something that Wall Street has really focused on over the last several months in the wake of the success of Barbie and what this could do for a company that you would think in a time like this would be struggling a lot more than it is given the pullback that we're seeing in consumer discretionary spending.Story continuesBut Mattel, its position there the fact that it was able to make Barbie relevant once again in appeal to multiple generations I think also just shows what the potential future could look like here for Mattel when we talk about some of the other movies that could be on the docket.BRAD SMITH: It also makes it all the more important for them to see a resolution, not only on the writers strike as we got that coming forward, but then additionally on the actor's strike too because the delay of either of those movies could really look at a scenario where Mattel is also going to have to push out when it can recognize that revenue, especially considering how they were able to create so much fanfare around the Barbie movie and so many different shoppable moments along the way. Heck, I bought our esteemed Ken ""I am Kenough"" mug. So he's got that prominently placed.I think it's on his-- I think it's on his desk. I hope it's still there.SEANA SMITH: We got to check it out after the show.BRAD SMITH: Let us know. Slide in our Slack DMs.SEANA SMITH: I know. There's a couple of people on the production teams who have jumped in on the Barbie stuff.BRAD SMITH: OK.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. So I mean, it just speaks to the power of it.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which Schlumberger falls in, has gained 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of +22.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +36.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 indicates a change of +25.4% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Schlumberger is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.33 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.92 billion and $36.85 billion estimates indicate +17.2% and +12% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.6%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.65%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rising prices, elevated energy costs, and slowing economic growth mean the one constant investors can count on is the reliability of dividend stocks to see them through. That’s why you should include Dividend Kings in your portfolio. Dividend Kings are the elite of dividend stocks. They are companies that increased their payout every year for 50 years or more. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s proof they’re not only solid businesses, but they also have a bedrock commitment to returning value to shareholders.The asset managers at Hartford Funds looked at the benchmark S&amp;P 500’s performance going all the way back to 1930. They found dividend stocks never lost money over any decade. They found that during the 50-year period between 1973 and 2022, companies that consistently raised their payout outperformed all other categories of stocks.Only 47 companies qualify as Dividend Kings. That makes it a very exclusive list. But the following seven stocks are down between 10% and 29% over the past year and should be bought on the dip.Leggett &amp; Platt (LEG) A magnifying glass is focused on the logo for Leggett &amp; Platt on the company's website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comLeggett &amp; Platt (NYSE:LEG) is the leading manufacturer of mattress and sofa innerspring coils and a major supplier of adjustable beds. Bedding accounts for 46% of revenue, but combined with flooring and automotive, the three segments represent 81% of the total. Naturally, that makes it subject to the vagaries of the housing and auto markets, both of which have been tested recently.Yet they are showing signs of resilience and stabilization. New home sales were up 4.4% in July while new car sales jumped 15% in August. Still, the spring maker lowered full-year guidance because it sees ongoing volatility in its primary end markets with no visibility into how long it will last. The stock is down 28.8% over the past year, causing its dividend yield to jump to 7%.Story continuesYet with a 52-year track record of raising its payout, Leggett &amp; Platt is a Dividend King you can sleep comfortably owning knowing it will survive the turmoil.Black Hills (BKH) multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skyline. AQN stockSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.comElectric and gas utility Black Hills (NYSE: BKH) is another relatively unknown Dividend King. Based in South Dakota, Black Hills serves 1.3 million customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming.Utility stocks are boring compared to tech stocks and biotechs, but they’re supposed to be. Investors buy them for their stability and regularity of income. Black Hills has also raised its dividend for 52 years and targets long-term growth between 4% to 6% annually.The stock is down 28.8% over the last 12 months after deemphasizing capital expenditures in favor of strengthening its balance sheet. That was a smart strategy by management, but pushed the dividend yield to 4.1%. It plans to resume infrastructure spending in 2024. Customer growth is expanding in key states and it is seeing traction in new markets, such as data centers and blockchain customers. With a depressed stock and an enviable history of dividend increases, Black Hills is one of the Dividend Kings to count on.Commerce Bancshares (CBSH) Golden light shining from crack of door on black safe with black background, representing bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/marozhka studioThe financial market was thrown into crisis after Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank (OTCMKTS: SBNY) and First Republic Bank were seized by regulators. The upheaval hit regional banks like Commerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) hard. Ratings agency Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) downgraded its credit rating, along with nine others. The stock crumbed 27.5% over the last 12 months. Although they all remain investment grade, rising interest rates forced the banks to pay more for deposits while weakening the value of their securities and loans. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate from near-zero to a high of 5.5%.Commerce Bancshares operates primarily in the Midwest. It provides a broad range of retail, mortgage banking, corporate, investment, trust, and asset management products and services to both individuals and businesses. It’s been in business for over 150 years and is one of the 50 largest banks in the U.S. based on total assets.Despite the downgrade, Commerce Bancshares remains solid. Its Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of how well capitalized a bank is in the event of an economic downturn, is 14.75%. That puts it among the best of the biggest banks based on assets.Commerce Bancshares has raised its dividend for 54 years and counting and the payout yields 2.2% annually. It’s a company you can bank on weathering the storm.Target (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comDiscount retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) was a pandemic darling whose stock rocketed 80% higher over the two-year period of 2020 to 2021. Since then shares are down 47% and they’ve lost 25.6% of their value in the last year alone.An excess of stimulus check spending fueled the Covid boom. Lockdown consumers went on a “revenge shopping” spending spree. Unfortunately, Target misjudged trends and ended up with significant excess inventory. Skyrocketing inflation also caused consumers to become more cautious about spending money.Target also waded into the culture wars with an LGBTQ marketing campaign targeting children. The consumer backlash was swift and quarterly sales fell for the first time in six years. Where the retailer once was an exemplary e-commerce powerhouse, online sales tumbled over 10%. Total sales were down 5% in this year’s second quarter.Yet Target looks back on track. Inventory is under control again and full-year earnings are tracking higher than the pandemic bubble. Target’s raised its dividend for 54 years and the 3.6% yield is a lucrative enticement to a depressed stock.Hormel (HRL) Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo. HRL stock.Source: viewimage / ShutterstockPackaged meats producer Hormel (NYSE:HRL) is well-known for its own branded products and for Dinty Moore, Spam and Skippy. It also recently bought the well-known Planters snack nuts brand.Its stock was hurt by the latest outbreak of avian flu amongst turkies (it also owns the popular Jennie-O turkey brand). The stock is down 16.8% over the past year.But this is a passing issue. In its just completed third quarter, Hormel reported volume sales increases across all segments, but especially in turkey, and it continues to reduce inventories to historic levels.Hormel is an international company and China plays an important role. Ongoing softness there led to a 6% drop in international sales. Management had forecast a quicker, stronger recovery to China’s economy, but president and CEO Jim Snee told analysts, “we were wrong.” Hormel is still expecting regrowth, but it’s weighing on performance at the moment.In the meantime, investors can find solace in Hormel’s dividend. It’s made a payout since going public in 1928 and has raised the dividend every year for the last 57 years. The dividend yields 2.8% annually.Northwest Natural (NWN) Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockAnother electric utility, Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN) provides natural gas utility services to the northwestern states of Oregon and Washington. It also provides water service in Texas and Arizona. It’s been in business since 1859 and has paid a dividend for over 70 years. It is also the one Dividend King on this list that has the longest unbroken string of dividend increases, some 67 consecutive years. Yet the stock is down 15.4% for the last 12 months.That’s because Northwest Natural is under pressure from inflation. Unlike other businesses, utilities cannot simply raise prices to meet rising costs. They need to go through regulators for rate increases. While rates generally do rise in relation to expenses, whether from higher input costs or those necessary to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, it’s a lagging tailwind. The utility’s margins have been under pressure.Having hit its lowest levels in nearly a decade, Northwest Natural’s stock is on the rise again. Shares are 10% off their lows. Expect them to keep rising. As populations rise in its service markets, the utility will add more customers, increasing revenue and profits.Tootsie Roll Industries (TR)A close-up shot of Tootsie Roll (TR) candies.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.comConfectioner Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) is not so much unknown, as it is unpopular. Trading volumes are extremely low, averaging only 175,000 shares daily. In contrast, Hershey (NYSE:HSY) trades about 1.2 million shares a day and Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) does 6.2 million.The stock is also heavily shorted with days to cover standing at 7.9. That’s the time it would take short sellers to cover their position. Anything over seven days is a lot. Founded only two years after Hershey in 1896, Tootsie Roll has been majority-owned by the Gordon family since the 1930s. That gives Tootsie Roll stability, but it is also a liability of sorts. Where Hershey expanded into healthy snacks, the Gordons prefer to just keep making candy. There’s something to be said for sticking to your knitting, but chocolate consumption is declining. The National Confectioners Association says units sales fell 4.2% in 2022 and volume was 2.6% lower. The stock is down 11.3% in the past year.With the Gordons in their 90s, there is the likelihood of change. That could spur new growth and ignite the stock once more.Sysco (SYY) Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockFood distributor Sysco (NYSE:SYY) leads the industry with a 17% share of a highly fragmented market. It operates 334 distribution facilities globally and serves approximately 725,000 customer locations. Like many of the companies in this list, Sysco feels the heat applied by inflation and high commodity costs. The Dept. of Labor said food and energy drove inflation to its biggest monthly increase this year in August.Sysco’s sales, volume, and profits were all higher in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in July. For the full year, the company generated sales of more than $76 billion and operating income is at record highs. Earnings per share soared 45% over last year while adjusted earnings were up 16.5% from the year ago period.CEO Kevin Hourican told analysts the tailwinds Sysco is experiencing comes from healthcare, education, travel, and hospitality where it is “winning market share profitably in those sectors.”Sysco has a 53-year record of raising its dividend that currently yields 2.8%. It’s a stock that will deliver for investors over the long haul.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in LEG, NWN, TR, and SYY stock.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the autonomous vehicle industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy Now.According to Allied Market Research, the size of the autonomous vehicle industry is set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% between 2021 and 2030. At the end of 2020, the size of the autonomous vehicle and trucking industry was valued at $76.13 billion. It is anticipated to reach $2.16 trillion by the end of this decade. The global autonomous vehicle market can be broken down into six sub-categories, namely application, automation, component, propulsion type, region, and vehicle type. According to a report released by leading management consulting firm McKinsey in January 2023, autonomous driving has the potential to contribute $300 billion to $400 billion to the top line of companies involved in this industry by 2035. Within this estimate, around $170 billion to $230 billion is expected to be contributed by Level 4 automation, which refers to a high level of automation where the vehicle can drive itself under certain conditions, but a human driver must be able to take over when the system requests. The driver does not need to constantly monitor the driving environment. The analysts at McKinsey believe that the hardware and software cost of Level 3 and Level 4 automation could be as high as $5,000 per vehicle. McKinsey anticipates that 12% of new passenger cars sold by 2030 will have at least Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities. Meanwhile, the adoption of advanced autonomous driving technologies is expected to reduce the number of accidents by 15% in Europe by 2030.Transforming the Trucking Industry with Autonomous TechnologyInvesting in the best autonomous driving stocks requires a long-term view. Numerous self-driving car companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have introduced autonomous vehicles across various cities in the US and across the world. Investors who opt for an early buy-in into this theme could see a significant upside down the line. The introduction of autonomous technology into the trucking industry holds significant importance due to its critical role in various industries' supply chains. It’s worth noting that trucks are involved in over 500,000 accidents annually, equivalent to 9.5% of total accidents in the US. Truck drivers have a 10 times higher probability of death on the job as compared to an average American. According to the CEO of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based autonomous technology provider Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR), Chris Urmson, 29 of the 30 incidents that took place between Dallas and Houston could have been avoided if Aurora Driver had operated the truck instead of a human. This reflects the high level of safety guaranteed by autonomous driving technologies. The company is working on introducing completely autonomous driving trucks without the presence of a human by the end of 2024. This could play a pivotal role in overcoming the shortage of long-haul truck drivers in the US, which currently stands at 80,000 and is anticipated to double by 2030. Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR) is considered among the best under-the-radar autonomous vehicle stocks.

Experts believe that the Silicon Valley state already has the toughest regulations for autonomous vehicles in the US. The state has only allowed light-duty trucks on its public roads, and companies must undergo numerous tests before deploying any new automobile-related technology on the roads. Meanwhile, China is also amongst the countries at the forefront of promoting autonomous driving technology. In Beijing, the world's first fully connected cloud-controlled autonomous driving demonstration zone has been established. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a leading name in the autonomous driving industry in China through its Apollo Go division. During the first quarter of 2023, approximately 42%  of new passenger vehicles sold in China were equipped with varying levels of autonomous driving assistance features. China boasts a vast network of over 20,000 kilometers (km) of roads available for autonomous vehicle testing. With this context in mind, let's take a look at our autonomous driving companies' rankings.12 Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy NowRasica/Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyWe have shortlisted the 12 best autonomous driving stocks to buy using Insider Monkey's database of 910 elite hedge funds. Each of the companies listed below provides exposure to either one or multiple sub-categories of the autonomous trucking and vehicle industry. We have ranked the best autonomous driving stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2023.Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy Now12. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $1,759,298,500Market Capitalization: $46.62 billionBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based artificial intelligence (AI) and internet company. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has taken a major initiative to advance autonomous vehicles through its Apollo program. The company has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in China since 2018 using its Apollo open self-driving platform. Its test fleet has logged over 60 million kilometers of autonomous driving. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) recently expanded its fleet of driverless taxis in Wuhan to 300.Here's what Ariel Investments said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“By comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China’s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company’s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”11. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $404,462,190Market Capitalization: $3.84 billionLyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a San Francisco, California-based ride-hailing service provider and a competitor of Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the North American region. The company claims to have provided 100,000 rides in autonomous vehicles. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is developing self-driving car technology through its Level 5 division. Level 5 aims to build ridesharing vehicles that can operate safely without human drivers. The company is at the eleventh position on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The sale of rideshare provider Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), similar to our moves in communication services, prunes a smaller position to consolidate the portfolio in our highest conviction ideas. We initially purchased Lyft in May 2021 when rideshare volumes were still depressed due to COVID-19. While Lyft was a clear #2 behind Uber in domestic rideshare, we believed it was a cleaner way to play the U.S. recovery due to the focused nature of its business. However, poor execution and the uneven nature of the U.S. recovery, with West Coast markets where Lyft has historically had greater exposure lagging due to a lack of return to office work, further weakened its market position. In March, Lyft announced co-founder Logan Green would step down as CEO with David Risher, a former Amazon executive, taking his place. While Risher has laid out ambitions to drive Lyft’s market share higher, we believe doing so will require more than a few quarters fix. Furthermore, while the company has looked for areas to right size their cost base, we see necessary investments in price, service levels and product differentiation to drive this turnaround further pushing out the path to improved profitability.”10. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $895,505,810Market Capitalization: $49.75 billionFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) has established a dedicated subsidiary known as Latitude AI solely focused on the development of autonomous driving technology. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker intends to bring together experts in the field of machine learning, operations, sensors, software, and systems engineering together for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has recorded over 50 million miles of hands-free driving through its Active Driving Assistance System, Ford BlueCruise.9. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $1,823,077,500Market Capitalization: $27.69 billionAptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is a Troy, Michigan-based automotive technology company focused on advanced safety, connectivity, and self-driving solutions for major automakers. The company has the distinction of rolling out autonomous ride-hailing services on a commercial level in the city of Las Vegas. As of 2023, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) has provided over 100,000 self-driving rides to the general public and claims it has received 100% ratings from 98% of the customers.Here's what Artisan Partners said about one of the best autonomous driving stocks in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Along with Catalent, we ended our investment campaigns in Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) and Nasdaq during the quarter. Aptiv is a leading provider of safety, infotainment and electronic control components to the automotive market. Our view was that the company was well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular industry trends—the shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, autonomous driving and increased computing intensity in vehicles. Over our holding period, a volatile macro environment (pandemic, supply chain shortages) steadily weighed on the profit cycle despite the company’s strong new business announcements. Furthermore, we believe the company may be increasingly disadvantaged as leading auto manufacturers work around tier-one suppliers (such as Aptiv) to maximize profits and speed to market. While the profit cycle may ultimately take hold, we concluded that several of our semiconductor holdings (ON Semiconductor, Lattice Semiconductor and Monolithic Power Systems) offer stronger leverage to these important new auto trends and decided to exit the position.”8. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $2,513,405,900Market Capitalization: $44.82 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is betting heavily on autonomous vehicles as it anticipates generating annual revenue of $50 billion through its Cruise autonomous vehicle division by 2030. To achieve this goal, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has expanded the presence of Cruise to cities in Arizona and Texas. Of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database at the end of Q2 2023, 72 funds reported owning a stake in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).7. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $2,303,052,600Market Capitalization: $120.17 billionQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a San Diego, California-based chipmaker that is targeting the autonomous vehicle industry through the Snapdragon Ride platform. The platform integrates multiple critical components for self-driving, including cameras, radars, LIDAR processing, CUDA cores for neural network AI, functional safety capabilities, and autonomous driving software. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) claims that Snapdragon Ride delivers over 700 trillion operations per second to run deep learning-based perception and planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has secured the seventh position on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $6,517,644,300Market Capitalization: $777.25 billionTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) gains exposure to the autonomous driving industry through its Full Self Driving (FSD) software. The software can be either purchased for a lump-sum payment of $12,000 or a monthly payment of $199. FSD is Tesla's advanced driver assistance system that uses onboard cameras, sensors, and neural net processing power to enable autonomous driving features in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. The platform’s capabilities include auto lane changing, automated parking, stopping at traffic lights and stop signs, and highway autopilot features.Here's what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:Many factors contributed to the strong performance of our largest Disruptive Growth position, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), in the period. Investors’ concerns regarding Tesla in 2022 continue to dissipate, and the company’s business has continued to grow materially, although at below peak margins. Tesla’s deliveries in China are recovering. The company’s newest factory in Texas has ramped production and should contribute to improved domestic sales and margins. U.S. government policies have lowered the cost to own Tesla vehicles, while also reducing the company’s battery production expenses.We continue to believe that Tesla is only scratching the surface of its potential. We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers. EV adoption is at a tipping point. And Tesla, with its approximately 60% domestic market share of EVs, should be the most important beneficiary of this shift…”  (Click here to read the full text)In addition to Tesla, Inc.

(HOLX) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-hologic-inc-130010808.html,1695819610,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned -8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has lost 7.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share, indicating a change of +3.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.92 points to a change of -34.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +1.8% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $941.83 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.2%. The $4.03 billion and $4.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.2% and +0.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $984.4 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.8%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $957.13 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.85%. The EPS surprise was +5.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The writers' union struck a tentative deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Walt Disney, Netflix and other studios on Sunday after five months of failed negotiations.SAG-AFTRA has a wide range of performers with different issues they want addressed.The performers want to protect their images and work from being replaced by ""digital replicas"" generated with AI while actors are looking for compensation that reflects the value they bring to streaming, specifically in the form of revenue sharing.Other demands from actors include limits on self-taped auditions used in casting, which they argue are more costly than in-person readings. They also want hair and makeup artists who can work with various hair textures and skin tones, to ensure equity for all performers.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.22%.Heading into today, shares of the internet video service had lost 11.8% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 4.13% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.86% in that time.Netflix will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 18, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.49, up 12.58% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.53 billion, up 7.59% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.91 per share and revenue of $33.72 billion. These totals would mark changes of +19.7% and +6.67%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.28% lower. Netflix currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Netflix currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 31.84. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.25, which means Netflix is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.26. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Broadcast Radio and Television was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.39 at yesterday's closing price.The Broadcast Radio and Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

Discovery shares rose more than 2% each, followed by Netflix and Disney whose shares went up 1% and 0.5% respectively. The WGA contract could act as a template for Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) to draft its own deal with the studios.AMPTP Has Adhered To WGA’s DemandsThe Writers Guild of America which represents 11,500 film and television writers successfully fought for an increase in minimum pay, a new residual for streaming based on viewership and limiting the use of artificial intelligence. The guild negotiated also negotiated better right in streaming with a new residual based on viewership.New Streaming StructureStreamers like Netflix will be obliged to provide the guild with statistics such as the number of hours streamed both domestically and internationally for self-produced high budget streaming programs. With the new residual implies that high budget subscription video on demand series and films that are viewed by 20% or more of the service’s domestic subscribers during the frst 90 days of release get a bonus equal to 50% of the fixed domestic and foreign residual.AI Restrictions To Protect WritersThe use of AI to write or rewrite literary material has been prohibited with AI-generated content will not be considered as source material.Contract TermsThe agreed upon deal will last until May 2026 and once ratified, it includes a 5% minimum pay increase along with another 4% rise expected in May 2024 and a 3.5% increase in May 2025. WGA members can vote in favor or against the contract until October 9th.Story continuesThe AMPTP Also Needs To Deal With SAG-AFTRAA five-month strike ended with better compensation and protection for writers but producers need to make a deal with SAG-AFTRA that is representing 160,000 film and television actors, stunt performers, voiceover artists and other media professionals. Although their requests are similar to those requested by writer, they have some additional requests such as the standardization of the self-tape process, which became popular during the pandemic, as actors have observed inequity in auditioning between those who can afford quality camera and lighting equipment and those who can’t. When SAG-AFTRA joined the strike in mid-July, it literally put Hollywood on pause as this was the first time in 63 years that two unions went on strike at the same time.The Damage Goes Beyond BillionsAccording to an estimate from Milken Institute economist Kevin Klowden, the economic cost of the two strikes costed California and other U.S. production hubs at least $5 billion. But the damage goes beyond billions, beginning with Disney who has been exploring AI possibilities in an effort to cut its costs, enraging writers and actors who fought fiercely over the last 150 days to limit the industry’s exploration of this technology. The once-beloved Disney CEO Bob Iger is no longer America’s most beloved CEO. Disney has already been dealing with several internal issues and an urgent need to reinvent its linear TV model in the streaming age, but Iger’s return didn’t helped bring back the magic. Moreover, by finding the demands of the unions ‘unrealistic’, Iger threatened the image of the world’s biggest entertainment company, and damaged his legacy, failing to find a diplomatic way out of this blunt statement. The cost of the strikes only made the already challenging remaking of Disney more difficult, with the deal further limiting Disney in exploiting the cost-cutting possibilities of AI.New Rules Are In PlayAlthough it is more challenging to evaluate the standing of Apple and Amazon when it comes to streaming as they report their results as part of larger divisions, Netflix showed during the strike that it is undoubtedly in a better shape compared to its rivals, especially Disney whose stock crashed to the lowest level in nine years at the end of August. Although Netflix didn’t tell the whole story of its successful projects, it was at least more transparent compared to its reluctant rivals by posting weekly updates about its best-performing content. In contrast, Amazon and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) never revealed how well any of their original productions have performed on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV Plus. But from now on, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Disney will need to reveal more official viewership data, kicking off a massive power shift on the streaming front and in the overall industry.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The recent writers' strike that sent ripples through the entertainment industry for almost five months affected Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock considerably. However, the end of the strike heralds a new era, brimming with opportunities for robust growth and recovery, positioning Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) for a renewed rise in its stock and overall market standing.NFLX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NFLXThe extensive writers' strike brought the buzzing world of Hollywood to a temporary halt, casting a shadow over various sectors of the entertainment industry, including streaming giants like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). This unforeseen hiatus impacted the steady flow of new content, translating into a hit on Netflix. The strike's conclusion comes as a relief and presents a chance for rejuvenation and resurgence, allowing Netflix to rebuild and recover in the post-strike period.Assessing Netflix's JourneyHence, this is an ideal moment to delve deeper and assess Netflix's journey. Utilizing GuruFocus' All-in-one Screener, we will consider and scrutinize the most recent information available to evaluate the financial health of this streaming behemoth as it navigates through these changing times.The New Contract and Its ImplicationsThe resolution of the strike, marked by the approval of a new contract by the unions' governing boards, has allowed writers to return to work, infusing fresh momentum into the industry. This new agreement ensures significant benefits for the writers, including substantial salary increases, bonuses for high-performing shows, and minimum staff guarantees. A crucial provision of this deal allows writers to partake in the success of content on streaming platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). This innovative approach promises to deliver a substantial boost to Netflix, reinforcing its position and offering a potential windfall in the time to come.Story continuesNetflixs Financial OutlookIn evaluating Netflixs financial health, its essential to delve into the intricate fiscal details post any industry disruption. Despite considerable industry turmoil, Netflix maintains a strong financial position, demonstrating resilience and strength. This exploration into Netflixs financial details reveals its diversified and robust financial aspects.Netflix reported a revenue of $8.19 billion, marking a 3% year-on-year increase, proving its financial stability even in uncertain times. The consistent revenue growth highlights Netflix's enduring appeal and reliability. Its net income stands at a noteworthy $1.49 billion, showing a similar 3% year-on-year growth, reinforcing the companys solid financial base.Netflix on the Rise Post-Writers' StrikeMoreover, a closer look at its operating income shows a positive trend, recorded at $1.83 billion, a significant approximately 16% increase. This rise emphasizes Netflix's operational efficiency and financial prudence. With a Debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 0.83, Netflix outranks 65.72% of its industry counterparts, indicating its strategic and effective debt management in line with its revenue, further solidifying its financial strength.Netflix on the Rise Post-Writers' StrikeAnother key financial aspect is the net cash change, which has seen a remarkable 588.31% growth, totaling $928.25 million. This substantial increase in cash reserves enhances Netflix's financial flexibility, providing the liquidity needed for achieving its strategic goals with greater financial agility.As for future growth, the prospects are positive. Netflix's expected 3-5 Year Total Revenue Growth Rate is a robust 10.19%, surpassing 73.94% of the companies in the Media - Diversified industry. The Future 3-5 Year EPS without NRI Growth Rate is projected at an optimistic 17.87%, highlighting the anticipated earnings growth that Netflix is strategically positioned for.Diversification and New StrategiesIn an innovative move, Netflix is branching out to become a video game platform, tapping into the booming gaming market. This initiative offers an exciting revenue stream and a broader audience base. The company is also launching a cheaper ad-supported subscription plan, aimed at making the service more affordable and generating additional revenue from advertising. This strategic move can potentially attract a new customer base and retain current subscribers contemplating discontinuing the service.ChallengesThe streaming industry's landscape has transformed dramatically in recent times, with Netflix now facing unprecedented challenges. The streaming market is teeming with both new and established contenders, such as Disney+, HBO Max, Paramount+, Amazon Prime, and Peacock. These platforms are providing a diverse range of options including original content, sports, and live programming, possibly resonating more with audiences compared to Netflix's offerings. This burgeoning competition and variety have led some viewers to explore alternatives, contributing to Netflix's declining subscriber base.To combat this, Netflix had increased its subscription prices to fund more original content. However, this move inadvertently contributed to a further loss in subscribers as the higher prices deterred potential and existing customers.Investor sentiment towards Netflix is seemingly dwindling, underscored by a disappointing third-quarter sales forecast. The subsequent sell-off of Netflix highlights the growing concern and diminished confidence in the company's financial future. Despite the efforts to implement strategies such as the introduction of a paid sharing feature and the expansion into video gaming, these have not wholly assuaged investors' concerns. The Average Revenue per Membership (ARM) has seen a decline, further adding to the apprehensions about the companys financial health. The projected flat to slight downfall in the ARM in the third quarter reinforces these concerns, signaling potential issues in its pricing power and near-term revenue growth.Netflix's Response to ChallengesEven amidst the challenges encountered, Netflix is taking active measures to bounce back. The company is embarking on numerous strategies to reclaim its pace. A notable move is the worldwide extension of a paid sharing feature, which permits another household to use a current Netflix account for an additional charge. This move played a part in Netflix gaining 5.9 million global subscribers in the second quarter of 2023, marking a positive shift from the nearly 1 million subscriber loss in the same quarter of the previous year. Furthermore, Netflix is significantly investing in original content in various nations, aiming to attract a global audience and possibly reducing expenses by filming outside the U.S.TakeawayWhile facing considerable challenges, Netflix is proactively navigating the competitive terrain by introducing diverse strategies to boost subscription numbers and revenue. The road ahead is fraught with uncertainties, and the effectiveness of these initiatives remains to be seen. The increasing competition, evolving market dynamics, and financial forecasts present substantial hurdles. However, Netflix's endeavors to diversify, innovate, and adapt to the shifting landscape underscore its commitment to maintaining its market position and driving future growth.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
217,56f81306-b08e-3c46-9a1a-b5281e518865,NFLX,2023-09-28,WGA strike ends with tentative deal while actors' strike continues,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/wga-strike-ends-tentative-deal-153818147.html,1695829098,VIDEO,"['WBD', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'NFLX']","[The Hollywood writers' strike has come to an end after over 140 days. The tentative deal between the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) has still yet to be ratified with a vote, but writers have been given the green light to return to production. Despite this monumental deal, major productions are still halted by the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors strike.Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita joins the Live show to break down the details of the new contract between the writers and studio executives, as well as the current status of the actors' strike.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's talk about another headline here, and that's, the Hollywood writers strike has finally come to a close after 148 days. The WGA strike was just shy of becoming the longest running strike in Hollywood history, falling short of the 154-day strike back in 1988. Let's bring Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita to give us more insight into the contract, what we know about this agreement. Akiko--AKIKO FUJITA: Good morning to you, Seana. That's right. Well, this deal still needs to be ratified by members of the Writers Guild. But for the first time today, writers do have the green light to go back on the job after five months off the job. Now the final deal that was reached between the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers points to a real shift here in the way that writers are now compensated in the streaming era.Specifically, writers will receive a pay increase ranging from 3 and 1/2 to 5% over the course of the three-year contract. Members will now be eligible for residuals, based on streaming views, with a 50% bonus baked in for projects viewed by 20% of a given platform subscribers, and that is over the course of the initial 90 days of release.Writers also secured productions against artificial intelligence, a key-sticking point here for rewriting original materials, or source material. That means studios will now be required to disclose to writers, whether, in fact source material was generated by AI. And studios will also be required to staff a minimum of three writer producers for first-season shows that have a runtime of roughly 20 weeks or more.Story continuesNow, while writers have a deal in hand, major production for content isn't expected to resume largely, because there are no actors to go forward on scripted content. The members of SAG-AFTRA remain on strike. If the Union does not reach an agreement soon, production is likely to be pushed back even further.Now, meantime, the economic impact from this strike continues to ripple across the region, with everybody from caterers to dry cleaners, as well as restaurants, all on hold over the last five months. The latest numbers from the Milken Institute estimate it's already taken $5 billion from the region guys.BRAD SMITH: And so are there portions, or at least, elements of what the WGA is voting for, and their attempt to ratify an agreement that could also be passed through into the actor's side as well, Akiko?AKIKO FUJITA: Well, artificial intelligence, certainly a significant one. In the case of SAG-AFTRA, they are looking for protections, especially for background actors. We know them as extras, that's been the traditional term here. But background actors arguing that they shouldn't be able to have actors scanned, only to have AI generate them in the background. So that's one of many issues here.It's worth noting, though, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP have not met in roughly two months. There is no schedule, at least a meeting on the table right now. But the expectation is, now that there is a WGA deal on the table, SAG-AFTRA is next in line. The hope is things could get resolved pretty quickly there. So the year is not awash.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Phillips 66. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Phillips 66?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Phillips 66 already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Phillips 66, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Phillips 66 is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.0% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Phillips 66The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Phillips 66 in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$122m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Phillips 66. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

PSX recently overtook the 20-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.Shares of PSX have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 6.3%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, suggesting that PSX could be poised for a continued surge.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider PSX's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 8 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.Investors should think about putting PSX on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on TJX Companies'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:60% = US$4.0b ÷ US$6.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.60 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 60% ROETo begin with, TJX Companies has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for TJX Companies' moderate 6.3% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared TJX Companies' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 26% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is TJX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is TJX Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 39% (implying that the company retains 61% of its profits), it seems that TJX Companies is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, TJX Companies is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 37%. As a result, TJX Companies' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 62% for future ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that TJX Companies' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapInvestment Risks: The Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newmont should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.46. These indicators suggest that Newmont, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany Snapshot: Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM)As the world's largest gold miner, Newmont produced about 6 million attributable ounces of gold in 2022, accounting for about 5% of global mined output. The company also produced 1.3 million attributable gold equivalent ounces from the sale of byproducts, including copper, silver, zinc, and lead in 2022. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant byproduct reserves at the end of 2022. After buying Goldcorp in 2019 and combining its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Barrick later that year, Newmont's portfolio includes 12 wholly owned mines and interests in two joint ventures in the Americas, Africa, and Australia.Is Newmont (NEM) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapNewmont's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Newmont's Altman Z-score reveals Newmont's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Newmont's historical data, 2021: 0.10; 2022: 0.08; 2023: 0.02, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Newmont's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Newmont's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.09; 2022: 0.02; 2023: 0.00) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Newmont might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.Conclusion: Navigating the Value TrapIn conclusion, despite Newmont's seemingly attractive valuation, the company's low Altman Z-Score and declining financial ratios suggest potential financial distress. This indicates that Newmont may be a value trap, underlining the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Public Service Enterprise Group is:18% = US$2.8b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.18 in profit.Does Public Service Enterprise Group Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Public Service Enterprise Group has a better ROE than the average (9.1%) in the Integrated Utilities industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Public Service Enterprise Group by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesPublic Service Enterprise Group's Debt And Its 18% ROEPublic Service Enterprise Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.31. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Public Service Enterprise Group may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

""The consumer is proving to be resilient.Here's how Nike's results stacked up against Wall Street analyst expectations, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:Revenue: $12.94 billion vs. $12.99 billion (est.) and $12.69 billion (same period year prior)Adj. earnings per share (EPS): $0.94 vs. $0.75 (est.) and $0.93 (same period year prior)Gross margin estimate: 44.2% vs. 43.7% (est.) and 44.3% (same period year prior)Nike's inventories fell in the quarter to $8.7 billion down 10% compared to the year prior. Analysts had anticipated inventories of $8.84 billion. The metric has been closely tracked since an inventory glut plagued the retailer throughout 2022. Meanwhile, direct-to-consumer sales, a closely watched growth metric for the shoe giant, increased to $5.4 billion, up 6% from the same period a year ago.Nike's stock had stumbled into the report with shares falling 9% over the last month, and Wall Street analysts were warning of a subdued report from the athletic apparel behemoth.Revenue in Greater China had been a key concern for investors headed into the report. The Chinese economy has produced slower economic growth than expected this year. Wall Street analysts fear that could also weigh on companies like Nike, who have significant exposure to China.Story continuesIn the most recent quarter, Nike saw revenue in Greater China at $1.74 billion. Analysts had expected the segment to show $1.83 billion in sales, according to Bloomberg consensus data.""The China story is probably the biggest one here for Nike,"" Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""The challenge is that Nike has been very dependent on the Asian market, certainly on the Chinese consumer. Not only do you have issues with the softening of the Chinese consumer and their spending ability but also just a lot of geopolitical risk that is there.""Nike executives cooled concerns over China during the call with investors on Thursday night, though. Nike CEO John Donahoe said he's been to China twice in the past four months and noted he feels good about the market and Nike's position in it.""Sport is back in China, you can just feel it,"" Donahoe said. ""That gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there.""Nike's report also comes about a month after Foot Locker warned of a slowdown in its footwear business due to ""price sensitive"" consumers. About 64% of sales at Foot Locker (FL) are the Nike brand, according to Jefferies. If Foot Locker struggles to offload Nike inventory that could impact the shoe giant's wholesale market, Wall Street analysts noted.But management highlighted during the call that no retail partner represents more than a ""mid-single"" digit portion of Nike's overall sales.For the quarter, Nike reported wholesale revenues growth that came in flat compared to the same period a year prior. The Street had been expecting a decline of 4% from the same period a year prior.Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator Vance Joseph wearing Nike Jordan 1 low tops against the Denver Broncos during an NFL football game Dec. 18, 2022, in Denver.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Craig-Hallum upgraded WW (WW) to Hold from Sell with a price target of $10, up from $4. Given the potential new GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro have to transform the treatment of obesity and related conditions, GLP-1s are starting to look like healthcare's artificial-intelligence moment, and as it relates to WW, the opportunity could be significant, the firm says.HSBC upgraded DocuSign (DOCU) to Hold from Reduce with an unchanged price target of $42. The firm says DocuSign is making progress in stabilizing revenue and that it is ""incrementally positive on the new risk/reward.""HSBC upgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $69, up from $58. The stock's recent underperformance provides a good entry point to a business with exposure to decarbonization and sustainable buildings, the firm says.Piper Sandler upgraded Guardant Health (GH) to Overweight from Neutral with a $40 price target.

The firm expects earnings growth to stabilize, which should be a positive catalyst for each stock, ""especially given their current historically low multiples.""Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Hasbro (HAS) with an Overweight rating and $84 price target.

233,d61db3c8-5efc-3e62-93ee-8a24bbfe6333,M,2023-09-28,Dell Technologies and OneWater Marine have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-technologies-onewater-marine-highlighted-115000658.html,1695815400,STORY,"['DELL', 'ONEW', 'M', '^GSPC', 'TGT']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 27, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Dell Technologies DELL as the Bull of the Day and OneWater Marine ONEW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Target TGT, Macy's M and Amazon AMZN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Dell Technologies stock is showing considerable relative strength in a weak market environment and is further bolstered by a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Dell Technologies is a provider of information technology solutions including servers, storage, and networking products as well as commercial and consumer notebooks, desktop computers and workstations.In addition to a rebound in PC sales, which seem to have bounced off a bottom, its growth in server sales is being accelerated by the explosion in Artificial Intelligence opportunities. 20% of server orders YTD were AI enabled.DELL continues to adjust to the technology market's needs and with a reasonable valuation, and strong price momentum is a worthy investment consideration for any investor's portfolio.Earnings Estimates Snap HigherAt the most recent quarterly earnings report Dell Technologies beat analysts estimates by a whopping 54% and marked its sixth consecutive upward earnings surprise. These strong results have prompted analysts to make some significant revisions higher to future earnings expectations, as can be seen in the chart below.Current quarterly earnings estimates have been revised higher by 8.1% and FY23 earnings estimates have increased by 13.5% over the last two months. EPS are forecast to climb 12% annually over the next 3-5 years.Strong Stock in a Weak TapeSince the last Federal Reserve interest rate meeting on September 20, stocks have been reeling, as Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated that he would continue to keep interest rates higher for longer. And while the S&amp;P 500 is down nearly -6% month to date, Dell Technologies shows immense relative strength.Story continuesFurthermore, the price action in DELL stock has been forming a compelling technical chart pattern. The stock has been building out this bull flag consolidation over the last two weeks and if the price can breakout and close above the $70 level, it should make a bull run.Critical to DELL moving higher in the short term will be how the broad market acts. However, even if there is some market weakness that pulls down DELL stock in the very short term it remains a convincing investment over the medium and long term.Reasonable ValuationEven with double digit earnings growth estimates, and a strong position in its respective market, Dell Technologies trades at a very reasonable valuation. Today, it is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 13.1x, which is well below the industry average of 34.5x, and above its three-year median of 10.3x.DELL also pays a generous dividend yield of 2.1% and raised the payout by 12% over the last year.Bottom LineDell Technologies, with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), demonstrates resilience and adaptability in a volatile market, making it a noteworthy investment consideration. The company's innovation in AI-enabled server sales and its rebound in PC sales highlight its potential for sustained growth. Despite broader market uncertainties, its reasonable valuation, strong price momentum, and substantial dividend yield enhance its appeal, making Dell a promising investment for the discerning investor.Bear of the Day:OneWater Marine, a premium boat retailer, is trading in a steep down trend, punctuated by dismal guidance from management, falling earnings estimates, and compressing margins. These developments have led analysts to revise earnings estimates lower, giving OneWater Marine a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating.Falling Earnings EstimatesEarnings estimates have been revised considerably lower over the last two months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been lowered by -73% and are projected to fall -66% YoY to $0.43 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised lower by -37% and are forecast to decline -50% YoY to $4.58 per share.Highlighting a bright spot for the boat retailer is that sales growth is expected to remain marginally positive this year and next, which is better than some of its competitors expect. Nonetheless, the industry is expected to see headwinds going forward.Bearish Technical PatternAfter gapping down more than -30% following the bleak Q3 earnings report, ONEW stock has remained under pressure. The price action isn't encouraging as a bearish wedge has formed in the chart, and a breakdown on Tuesday indicates there may be further downside action ahead.ValuationOneWater Marine is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 5.4x, which is in line with its historical median, and well below the industry average of 24.8x.Bottom LineThe leisure and recreation industry currently sits in the bottom 3% (237 out of 245) of the Zacks Industry Rank, showing a broad weakness in the segment. After the incredible boom period following the Covid-19 pandemic, it seems a lot of consumer spending, especially big-ticket items like boats was pulled forward a couple years. However, there will be a time in the future where demand for ONEW products again picks up, and the stock will again be worth considering. But until those earnings estimates begin to trend higher, I would avoid the stock.Additional content:Retailers Ramp Up Staffing Ahead of Holiday SeasonWith the holiday season approaching, retailers are actively preparing to meet the high expectations of shoppers eager for exciting deals. Players in the industry are all geared up to walk the extra mile this festive season to capitalize on any potential upswing in demand. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending, exhibiting remarkable resilience despite a challenging economic environment.Strategies to Meet Consumer PreferencesThe holiday season holds significant importance for retailers as it contributes a substantial portion of their annual revenues. Consequently, retailers must proactively address logistical and inventory challenges while devising comprehensive strategies to deliver a seamless shopping experience, both in physical stores and online. Keeping all these aspects in mind and to keep pace with any unprecedented increase in demand, retailers are unveiling hiring plans for the holiday season.To cater to consumers' product preferences, retailers are focusing on replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization. These efforts are expected to result in the recruitment of a considerable number of seasonal associates who will play crucial roles in managing curbside and in-store pickups of online orders as well as doorstep deliveries. Furthermore, retailers are likely to expand their warehouse staff to ensure a smooth flow of inventory from distribution centers to stores throughout the festive season.Retailers' Hiring InitiativesTarget is set to appoint nearly 100,000 seasonal workers, aiming to provide a seamless shopping experience for its customers. The company is launching its holiday deals early, featuring thousands of new items priced under $25 across various categories.Target Circle members will enjoy exclusive access to the ""Deal of the Day"" shopping event, both in the store and online. From Oct 1 through Dec 24, customers can avail of incredible offers, including discounts on renowned national brands such as Apple, Nespresso, Dyson and Nintendo, along with an additional 5% discount with the RedCard.Keeping in mind the festive rush, Macy's plans to fill more than 38,000 full and part-time seasonal associates across its Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury stores, along with its distribution centers. The company is committed to offering competitive wages, with many positions starting at a minimum of $15 per hour.Macy's is on track to strengthen its omnichannel capabilities with investments in online shopping experiences, data and analytics, technology infrastructure as well as better fulfillment capabilities.Meanwhile, Amazon has ambitious plans to deploy 250,000 associates for the crucial festive season. The e-commerce giant aims to recruit individuals for both part-time and full-time positions, including roles in fulfillment centers and transportation, across the entire nation.Final ThoughtsThe significance of the holiday season for retailers cannot be overstated. This period marks a crucial juncture, often accounting for a substantial portion of annual sales. The influx of enthusiastic shoppers provides retailers with the opportunity to showcase their offerings, boost revenues and solidify brand loyalty. Retailers leverage this period to not only maximize sales but also leave an indelible impression on consumers.However, market analysts are skeptical about whether the upcoming holiday season will meet retailers' expectations. They believe that cautious consumer spending, influenced by diminishing household savings and ongoing economic uncertainties, could potentially hinder the season's performance. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 3.7% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period spanning from Nov 1 to Dec 24.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Never miss another market-moving headline.Zions Bancorp slashed at Morgan StanleyZions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) share fell more than 1% pre-market today after Morgan Stanley downgraded the company to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $32.00 (from $27.00).The firm's decision is based on several factors. Zions’ recent strong rally, up over 70% since May lows, has brought its valuation in line with industry peers, ending a period of consistent discount trading throughout 2023.“We believe this skews risk-reward to the downside in a higher for longer rate environment given the elevated risk of NIB outflow which would need to be replaced with higher cost client deposits currently off-balance sheet,” mentioned Morgan Stanley.Valley National cut to UnderweightMorgan Stanley downgraded Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $8.50 (from $8.00), as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.We think Consensus is underestimating the pressure on Valley's NII in a higher for longer rate environment. VLY has a 101% loan-to-deposit ratio (vs. ~84% for peers) which gives them less flexibility on deposit pricing in a higher for longer rate environment.Three more downgradesGordon Haskett downgraded Macy’s (NYSE:M) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $13.00 from $18.00.CFRA downgraded Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $42.00 from $51.00.Gordon Haskett downgraded Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $215.00.

Those higher rates are driving increased delinquencies (see BofA charts below) and could potentially lead to more charge-offs on department store credit cards soon.""We expect KSS and JWN will see a decline in credit revenue in the coming quarters as rising delinquencies turn into charge-offs,"" BofA analyst Lorraine Hutchinson said in the note to clients.Read more: How does the Fed affect your credit card interest rate?Credit losses are on the rise. (BofA) (BofA)Consumers are having trouble paying off their credit cards. (BofA) (BofA)Store credit cards — with interest rates in some cases above 30% — have long been a pure profit center for department stores.Credit card sales made up about 87% of operating profits at high-end department store Nordstrom in 2022, according to experts. In 2021, that number was 79%.Meanwhile, credit card sales generated the majority of operating profits at Kohl's in 2022, pros estimated.BofA's Hutchinson now sees fair value for Nordstrom stock at $13, down from $14 previously. Kohl's stock is being valued at $22 a share by Hutchinson, down from $25.Hutchinson added she expects a ""worsening credit cycle"" in coming quarters.The negative narrative around department store stocks, in large part due to credit cycle worries, took center stage during the second quarter reporting season in August.Macy's (M) said its second quarter credit card sales tanked 36% from the prior year to $150 million. The reason: Excess balances on Macy's Citibank-powered credit cards were met with a rising interest rate environment.Cash-strapped consumers — enduring an almost 25% annual percentage interest rate on the Macy's card — haven't been able to pay off their bills. Macy's has opted to write off those balances and could keep doing so in the quarters ahead.Story continues""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with Wall Street at the time. ""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Nordstrom faces a risk to profits from the Fed's interest rate hikes. (Getty Images) (Getty Images)Execs added that Macy's is seeing the most acute pressure among households earning $75,000 and under. Year to date, Macy's credit card sales are down about 24% from a year ago.Nordstrom echoed Macy's on its earnings call too.""We have seen delinquencies rising gradually, and they are now above pre-pandemic levels, which could result in higher credit losses in the second half and into 2024,"" Nordstrom CFO Cathy Smith said.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $43 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide engineering and technical design effort to support Research and Development Concept Formulation for current and future submarine platforms.Majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Groton, CT.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly due to upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. To this end, military submarines and other defense ships with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.Therefore, the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics with its Electric Boat business unit being the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. The unit has established standards of excellence in the design, construction and lifecycle support of submarines for the U.S. Navy. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Looking ahead, General Dynamics is investing $1.8 billion of capital in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support growth in submarine construction. It expects to substantially complete the investments by the end of 2023. Such investments are expected to enhance Electric Boat’s capability in submarine construction as well as provide lifecycle support for the same, which should enable it to win more contracts in the future.Peer MovesNations are investing heftily in submarines to improvise and upgrade their sea warfare capabilities. Looking ahead, per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% between 2023 and 2028. This indicates ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarine space.A few other defense primes that can reap the benefits of the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.Story continuesBAE Systems’ Astute class submarines are the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines and can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAESY has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 33.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter the increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. The company also provides launch systems for submarines. Its eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales indicates growth of 5.7% from the 2022 reported figure.Huntington Ingalls is another renowned submarine builder in the United States, with its division, Newport News, being one of the only two U.S. shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines. Newport News is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 3.5% from the 2022 reported figure. Huntington Ingalls delivered an average earnings surprise of 1.76% in the last four quarters.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

At the time, he warned there was a 75% chance of the US experiencing a recession by the end of 2022.His bearish call on the economy contrasts with predictions from some other experts who think the US economy may be able to achieve a ""soft landing,"" thanks to strong spending. This means that the Fed's relentless rate hikes would be able to achieve its goal of taming inflation while not triggering a recession.Story continuesHowever, oil prices have been rising recently and are nearing a key milestone of $100 a barrel, after major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would be extending output cuts.This could complicate efforts by central banks to bring inflation under control, as they may again be looking at further rate hikes — that could, in turn, hit the economy. Energy is a key input for economic activities, so higher oil prices generally lead to inflation.The benchmark US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were up 0.95% at $94.57 a barrel at 11.11 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Brent crude oil futures were up 0.86% at $97.38 a barrel.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Neither of those two factors is likely to abate soon.On the supply side, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ economies need a high enough price for long enough to maximize their short-term profits and diversify their economies away from oil. For Saudi, the diversification drive is already apparent in the inroads it's making in global sports, its positioning as a tourism hub, and its attempt to reinvent cities in projects such as Neom.But neither Saudi nor other OPEC members can readily afford to lose their energy sector entirely, even if the end of oil lies in the distant future. Instead, some are positioning themselves to become major players in renewable energy and carbon capture and storage. But pulling off this transition requires major investments, and high oil prices will help guarantee an orderly transition.On the other side, China and emerging markets like India will continue to demand oil as they grow. China’s current economic weakness, Struyven pointed out, is in non-oil dependent sectors such as real estate and exports. Even at a 4-5% growth rate, which is now expected for 2023 and 2024, China will continue to put an upward pressure on oil prices.Add to that the bumper growth in India—hovering between 6% and 7% this year and next and contributing up to 15% of global growth—and you have the ingredients for high energy prices globally, no matter what happens in the U.S. or other advanced economies.More news below.Peter Vanhampeter.vanham@fortune.com@petervanhamThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance.

WYNN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WYNNWynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 1/10GF Value rank: 10/10Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Wynn Resorts Ltd the GF Score of 68 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Wynn Resorts Ltd: A Snapshot of Its BusinessWynn Resorts Ltd, with a market cap of $10.27 billion, operates luxury casinos and resorts. Founded in 2002 by Steve Wynn, the company runs four megaresorts: Wynn Macau and Encore in Macau and Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas. The company also operates Wynn Interactive, a digital sports betting and iGaming platform. In 2019, the company received 76% and 24% of its pre-pandemic EBITDA from Macau and Las Vegas, respectively.Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsFinancial Strength BreakdownWynn Resorts Ltd's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.48 positions it worse than 91.74% of 569 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt.Story continuesThe company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.91, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.29 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 10.53, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 83.61% of 592 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Wynn Resorts Ltd seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -18.8 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 78.93% of 769 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Wynn Resorts Ltd predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsConclusionGiven Wynn Resorts Ltd's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a rich history and a strong presence in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry, its current financial indicators and growth prospects suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 4.4% gain over the past four weeks.This rise in share price is attributable to positive results reported by the company from a late-stage study which supported the benefits of olezarsen to treat familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare genetic disorder wherein the body is unable to breakdown fats. Based on these results, Ionis plans to file a regulatory submission for the drug. Currently, there is FDA approved therapy for FCS.This drug discovery and development company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -215.2%. Revenues are expected to be $132.98 million, down 16.9% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Ionis Pharmaceuticals, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on IONS going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and met once, delivering an average surprise of 8.47%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from PDCO is a private-label brand named Pivotal, while it continues adding stock keeping units to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Acquisitions: We are upbeat about PDCO’s strategy of expanding its business via strategic acquisitions. In January, it announced that it had, through subsidiaries, completed the previously-announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies.During fiscal 2023, Patterson Companies completed its acquisition of the Texas-based companies — Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies (RSVP and ACT) — that provide innovative solutions to veterinary practices through data extraction and conversion, staffing and video-based training services. In 2022, PDCO announced the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Dairy Tech, Inc., providing pasteurizing equipment and single-use bags.Story continuesFulfillment Facility Modernization to Optimize Supply: Patterson Companies started implementing strategic modernization of its existing fulfillment facilities and capabilities. The company is adding new technologies such as robots to automate order picking and enhance fulfillment pace. PDCO is also focusing on expanding its fulfillment capacity by opening next-generation centers across several countries that will help build a sustainable and more efficient channel capabilities. The company’s strategic investments in fulfillment centers should help alleviate capacity constraints, boost distribution capabilities and enhance growth. PDCO has allocated $17.1 million in capital spending during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to support its facility modernization and expansion, which was 17% higher than the year-ago period’s level.Strong Q1 Results: Patterson Companies’ better-than-expected revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2024 buoy optimism. Both the Dental and the Animal Health segments showed signs of improvement. Sales at both the segments were hurt by unfavorable currency movement. A prudent cost-savings approach and solid sales execution worked in favor of the stock, expanding adjusted operating margin. Sustained momentum in the Animal Health business bodes well.DownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies needs to continue to introduce newer products in the market to withstand competitive pressures. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Integration Risks: Patterson Companies has been on an acquisition spree, which is improving its revenue opportunities but aggravating integration risks. Regular acquisitions are also a distraction for management that is likely to impact organic growth. This may limit Patterson Companies’ future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a stable estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings was pegged at $2.50 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.71 billion, indicating a 5.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Patterson Companies, Inc.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. Just take a look at The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), which is up 25%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 20% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 12% in the last year , including dividends .While the stock has fallen 4.2% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the three years of share price growth, Bank of New York Mellon actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 8.7% per year.So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.Do you think that shareholders are buying for the 1.7% per annum revenue growth trend? We don't. While we don't have an obvious theory to explain the share price rise, a closer look at the data might be enlightening.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthBank of New York Mellon is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Bank of New York Mellon, it has a TSR of 37% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveBank of New York Mellon shareholders gained a total return of 12% during the year. But that was short of the market average. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 1.1% per year, over five years. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Bank of New York Mellon better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Bank of New York Mellon  that you should be aware of.Of course Bank of New York Mellon may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

A Comprehensive Guide,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-tyson-foods-tsn-value-233248819.html,1695771168,STORY,"['TSN', 'VALU']","[Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) has seen a daily gain of 1.28% and a 3-month gain of 3.15%, with an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 0.92. Despite these positive signs, the question remains: is the stock significantly undervalued? This article aims to answer this question through a thorough valuation analysis. We invite you to continue reading for an in-depth exploration of Tyson Foods' intrinsic value.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with GNRC. Click here to check it out. TSN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSNTyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) is a protein-focused food producer, selling raw chicken, beef, pork, and prepared foods. Chicken and beef are its two largest segments, each comprising about one-third of U.S. sales. Prepared foods constitute roughly 20% of sales and include brands like Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, and Sara Lee. However, most of these are in product categories rife with competition where Tyson does not have a massive market share lead. Tyson sells some products overseas, but the international segment accounts for just 5% of total revenue. The company is an active acquirer, with more recent years' purchases focused on international and food-service markets.Unveiling Tyson Foods (TSN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is an exclusive measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line denotes the stock's ideal fair trading value.Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) stock is estimated to be significantly undervalued based on the GuruFocus Value calculation. At its current price of $51.27 per share, Tyson Foods has a market cap of $18.20 billion, suggesting that the stock is significantly undervalued. As Tyson Foods is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Tyson Foods (TSN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Evaluating Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it is essential to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding a company's financial strength. Tyson Foods has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.08, which is worse than 81.67% of the companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Tyson Foods at 6 out of 10, indicating that Tyson Foods' financial strength is fair.Unveiling Tyson Foods (TSN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. Tyson Foods has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $53.30 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.92. Its operating margin is 2.41%, which ranks worse than 63.06% of the companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Overall, the profitability of Tyson Foods is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Tyson Foods is 8.2%, which ranks better than 55.71% of the companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 13.6%, which ranks better than 62.4% of the companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Tyson Foods's ROIC is 2.42 while its WACC came in at 6.86.Unveiling Tyson Foods (TSN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is estimated to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 62.4% of the companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.

The market is estimated to have grown more than 2% year-on-year since 2002. Some of the  biggest agricultural companies in the American market today are Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN).Despite such impressive statistics, a recent article by McKinsey posits that even the biggest agricultural companies in the US are currently under immense pressure. Across the world, farmers complain that prices for agricultural input like fertilizer and crop protection chemicals are at an all-time high, currently rising by more than 250% over the past couple of years. Moreover, the exacerbation of the climate change crisis is introducing further problems, as rising temperatures are leading to increased weather variability, more frequent acute conditions, longer periods of drought, and new species of invasive crops and pests, all of which collectively is significantly reducing annual yields. In the American Southwest, for example, there is a massive drought underway for the past 20 years, and experts have claimed that the the 21st century has been the region's driest time period in at least 1200 years.Agricultural Automation Trends: An OverviewAccording to McKinsey, to release the increasing pressure on the agricultural industry in 2023 and to maintain economic viability, farmers are resorting to innovative, technological solutions. In this vein, automation is showing significant promise in curtailing the effects of the climate crisis and aiding agriculturalists mitigate the resulting financial blow. Automated farming solutions tend to exist on a diverse spectrum, ranging from semi-automated technologies like assisted steering to entirely automated systems like weeding robots, each requiring varying levels of operator support. The next generation of automated technology is using a combination of sensors, analytics, robotics, and equipment to help farmers make more informed decisions on the field and capitalize on all available resources. Furthermore, the advent of artificial intelligence presents significant potential to automate decision-making using comprehensive sets of already-attained data points. Automated technology presents significant upside to row and specialty crop producers. For example, the use of automated systems in agriculture presents an upside of more than $400 per acre per year, nearly quadrupling returns on farmers’ investments. Therefore, some of the biggest agricultural companies in the US like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN) have already begun a process of integrating and incorporating automated technological solutions to their operations.Story continuesHowever, according to McKinsey's Farmers Global Insights Survey 2022, less than 5 percent of farmers in North America are adequately investing in next generation technology. In the survey, McKinsey also highlights certain trends prevalent in the agricultural sector in 2023 which are likely to propel the adoption of automated technology in agricultural practice.A trend which is almost immediately evident is that farm economics are a constant source of trepidation for farmers. Automation can aid primarily in two fundamental respects. Firstly, since supply chain disruptions and geopolitical challenges have caused the prices of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals to skyrocket by more than 15% globally over five years, US farmers have begun to cite input costs as the number one risk to their profitability, according to the survey. To read more about the price hike in the fertilizer segment of the agriculture industry, check out our article on 10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Secondly, labor challenges are also proving to be a constant pain point for farmers, especially since farmworkers are at high risk of injuries and have one of the highest fatal occupational injury rates in the United States. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to chemicals and sun also adds to the perception that farm work is inherently dangerous. These labor shortages - especially in the United States where more than 22 million pounds of fruits and vegetables were wasted in 2022 due to worker shortage - have caused farmworker wages to rise by roughly four percent annually between 2015 to 2022. Automation can help ease these challenges significantly.Digitization in Agriculture: A Sustainable ApproachAccording to an article by McKinsey, agricultural land covers more than half of habitable land around the world and is responsible for more than seventy percent of freshwater withdrawal. Furthermore, food systems are the leading cause of biodiversity loss and have increasingly begun to negatively impact biosphere integrity, human health, and food access. In 2019, the global agriculture industry accounted for more than thirty percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, making them a critical focus for meeting bold climate targets. Hence, as the climate crisis assumes a higher priority for governments globally, investors are increasingly focused on companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN), which have begun to implement sustainable transitions to curb agriculture's effects on nature and society beyond climate change.According to the article, achieving the objective of a 1.5° pathway will require actions by the biggest agricultural companies that extend throughout the value chain. Some of the more important actions to take are reducing food loss and waste, adopting dietary shifts, and adapting to a more sustainable usage of arable land, all of which are absolutely integral to decarbonization efforts. According to an article by Bloomberg, digital services have a strong interconnection with sustainability efforts in agriculture. As the public eye increasingly focuses on the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector, digital service providers are flocking in to market their platform's sustainability capabilities. The article posits that as farmers use digital services to monitor the administration of fertilizer, crop chemicals, and water, the efficiency of the entire process is substantially enhanced, thereby reducing the impact on emissions and ecology.In this effort, Bloomberg conducted a survey of digital platform owners, who maintained that digital monitoring of farming is essential to prove at scale the certification of regenerative farming practices that enhance soil health, organic carbon in the soil, and biodiversity promotion. Digitization of the farming process can also ensure supply chain transparency to promote sustainability and outcome-based pricing models, which incentivize a profound reduction in the use of agrochemicals.Vegetable FarmingPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 15 biggest agricultural companies companies in the U.S, we decided to look at a mix of both private and public companies.

Reuters reports that the investigation was to determine whether migrant children were used to clean slaughterhouses, after another report from The New York Times showed children working overnight shifts for contractors at the companies' plants. Both companies have told Yahoo Finance they have not received notice of a probe. Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan discusses what has been reported and how each company has responded to the allegations.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JARED BLIKRE: Poultry giant Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms, they're finding themselves under federal investigation coming after a report that some of their contractors are employing migrant children. Here with the details is Yahoo finance's Alexis Keenan. Alexis.ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Jared. Yes, this is the US Labor Department reportedly investigating the two poultry producers on complaints that they had or have migrant children working in their meat processing facilities in Virginia, those two separate companies, the two separate facilities. These are sanitizing workers reportedly. And they are working during overnight shifts. That's the way that this complaint is lodged. Now, both Perdue Farms and Tyson, they both tell Yahoo Finance that they've received no notice of a probe.But the two companies responding to our questions really differently. Perdue for their part telling Yahoo Finance that the workers at issue are employed by a third-party sanitation company in Tennessee, that's based in Tennessee, called Fayette Industrial. And they say this, ""The most important thing is ensuring underage labor has no place in business. We are conducting a third-party audit of our procedures."" And they also say they plan to cooperate fully with any government inquiry.Story continuesNow, Tyson for its part said that because the company had not received a notice of any inquiry that they therefore cannot comment at all. Now together, Perdue and Tyson, they produce about one-third of all of the poultry that is sold in the United States. So those are two absolute giants here in this industry. And this all came to a head after the New York Times magazine last week issued a report of a 14-year-old migrant worker who was working in reportedly Perdue facility and suffered a very severe arm injury.So we're still waiting to hear what the department of labor has to say and how extensive this probe is. Jared.JULIE HYMAN: I'll take it from here, Alexis. What kind of fines are we talking about potentially if it does-- if it is found that there's a liability here?ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, Julie. So one place to look is back in February. That's the most recent case where the department of labor did find a company called Packers Sanitation Services. And they're headquartered in Wisconsin. After an investigation by the department, they found that the company had employed 102 minors in meat processing facilities. They were fined, get this, just $15,000 approximately for each violation, so each worker that was working there illegally. All totaled, that fine comes to roughly $1.5 million.So when you're looking at a company like, let's say, Tyson Foods that's a public company here, Perdue being private, but revenue for the last 12 months for Tyson, $53 billion, a drop in the bucket here in terms of these fines. So, you know, that's probably why you're not seeing the stock move too much on this news.JARED BLIKRE: Makes sense. And we thank you for the report. Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan.]"

E-commerce is projected to increase 6.7% year over year, while in-store sales are expected to rise 2.9% year over year.Against this backdrop, e-Commerce ETFs like Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY) and ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN are likely to win in the holiday season 2023.Tech-Focused Gifting The demand for electronics, gadgets and gaming products is set to rise significantly due to the continued evolution of AI, immersive experiences and digital work environments. Furthermore, consumers who purchased gadgets during the pandemic may intend to upgrade to the latest models. Electronics’ sales are anticipated to rise 6.0% year over year during the holiday season.Notably, electronics sales gained 0.7% sequentially in August. A rise in electronics sales should go in favor of semiconductor funds and stocks.

The card needs to be registered in the Mercedes me user account, consequent to which customers can leverage a fingerprint sensor, which will be integrated into the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system. The MBUX display has been built with the power of innovative technologies and serves as a means to ensure seamless interaction between the users and vehicles.Therefore, fingerprints can now be put to use for completing hassle-free and safe digital fuel bill payments across Germany. The reach of such convenient payments is likely to be expanded to other vehicle-related services and across other European markets in the days ahead. The removal of the need to feed a PIN or authenticate payments through mobile device at the point of sale ensures a hassle-free in-vehicle experience.And this lucrative opportunity to make online payments from cars has been made possible by the integration of Mastercard Secure Card on File for Commerce Platforms technology into the automaker's car models. The technology makes use of uniquely assigned cryptograms to encrypt transaction data, thereby assuring the confidentiality of sensitive payment information.The recent launch reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to extend modernized payment solutions to boost the uptake of digital payments in the everyday lives of its consumers. And this time, the focus of MA remains to simplify the car driver’s journey across several European markets.In this manner, an enhanced digital suite of Mastercard, built through constant tie-ups and significant investments, is likely to help in establishing a solid presence across the digitally booming continent. And the presence of a worldwide trusted company like MA will encourage more consumers to adopt newer forms of digital payments in their daily experiences and activities.Story continuesThe increased uptake of Mastercard’s solutions may fetch higher revenues to the tech giant. Also, attaching a highly beneficial contactless payment facility to the tech giant’s card offerings suite in Germany is expected to prompt more nationwide customers to opt for MA’s cards and subsequently, expand its cardholder base.Shares of Mastercard have gained 40.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s 24.8% growth.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the autonomous vehicle industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy Now.According to Allied Market Research, the size of the autonomous vehicle industry is set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% between 2021 and 2030. At the end of 2020, the size of the autonomous vehicle and trucking industry was valued at $76.13 billion. It is anticipated to reach $2.16 trillion by the end of this decade. The global autonomous vehicle market can be broken down into six sub-categories, namely application, automation, component, propulsion type, region, and vehicle type. According to a report released by leading management consulting firm McKinsey in January 2023, autonomous driving has the potential to contribute $300 billion to $400 billion to the top line of companies involved in this industry by 2035. Within this estimate, around $170 billion to $230 billion is expected to be contributed by Level 4 automation, which refers to a high level of automation where the vehicle can drive itself under certain conditions, but a human driver must be able to take over when the system requests. The driver does not need to constantly monitor the driving environment. The analysts at McKinsey believe that the hardware and software cost of Level 3 and Level 4 automation could be as high as $5,000 per vehicle. McKinsey anticipates that 12% of new passenger cars sold by 2030 will have at least Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities. Meanwhile, the adoption of advanced autonomous driving technologies is expected to reduce the number of accidents by 15% in Europe by 2030.Transforming the Trucking Industry with Autonomous TechnologyInvesting in the best autonomous driving stocks requires a long-term view. Numerous self-driving car companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have introduced autonomous vehicles across various cities in the US and across the world. Investors who opt for an early buy-in into this theme could see a significant upside down the line. The introduction of autonomous technology into the trucking industry holds significant importance due to its critical role in various industries' supply chains. It’s worth noting that trucks are involved in over 500,000 accidents annually, equivalent to 9.5% of total accidents in the US. Truck drivers have a 10 times higher probability of death on the job as compared to an average American. According to the CEO of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based autonomous technology provider Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR), Chris Urmson, 29 of the 30 incidents that took place between Dallas and Houston could have been avoided if Aurora Driver had operated the truck instead of a human. This reflects the high level of safety guaranteed by autonomous driving technologies. The company is working on introducing completely autonomous driving trucks without the presence of a human by the end of 2024. This could play a pivotal role in overcoming the shortage of long-haul truck drivers in the US, which currently stands at 80,000 and is anticipated to double by 2030. Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR) is considered among the best under-the-radar autonomous vehicle stocks.

Experts believe that the Silicon Valley state already has the toughest regulations for autonomous vehicles in the US. The state has only allowed light-duty trucks on its public roads, and companies must undergo numerous tests before deploying any new automobile-related technology on the roads. Meanwhile, China is also amongst the countries at the forefront of promoting autonomous driving technology. In Beijing, the world's first fully connected cloud-controlled autonomous driving demonstration zone has been established. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a leading name in the autonomous driving industry in China through its Apollo Go division. During the first quarter of 2023, approximately 42%  of new passenger vehicles sold in China were equipped with varying levels of autonomous driving assistance features. China boasts a vast network of over 20,000 kilometers (km) of roads available for autonomous vehicle testing. With this context in mind, let's take a look at our autonomous driving companies' rankings.12 Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy NowRasica/Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyWe have shortlisted the 12 best autonomous driving stocks to buy using Insider Monkey's database of 910 elite hedge funds. Each of the companies listed below provides exposure to either one or multiple sub-categories of the autonomous trucking and vehicle industry. We have ranked the best autonomous driving stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2023.Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy Now12. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $1,759,298,500Market Capitalization: $46.62 billionBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based artificial intelligence (AI) and internet company. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has taken a major initiative to advance autonomous vehicles through its Apollo program. The company has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in China since 2018 using its Apollo open self-driving platform. Its test fleet has logged over 60 million kilometers of autonomous driving. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) recently expanded its fleet of driverless taxis in Wuhan to 300.Here's what Ariel Investments said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“By comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China’s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company’s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”11. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $404,462,190Market Capitalization: $3.84 billionLyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a San Francisco, California-based ride-hailing service provider and a competitor of Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the North American region. The company claims to have provided 100,000 rides in autonomous vehicles. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is developing self-driving car technology through its Level 5 division. Level 5 aims to build ridesharing vehicles that can operate safely without human drivers. The company is at the eleventh position on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The sale of rideshare provider Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), similar to our moves in communication services, prunes a smaller position to consolidate the portfolio in our highest conviction ideas. We initially purchased Lyft in May 2021 when rideshare volumes were still depressed due to COVID-19. While Lyft was a clear #2 behind Uber in domestic rideshare, we believed it was a cleaner way to play the U.S. recovery due to the focused nature of its business. However, poor execution and the uneven nature of the U.S. recovery, with West Coast markets where Lyft has historically had greater exposure lagging due to a lack of return to office work, further weakened its market position. In March, Lyft announced co-founder Logan Green would step down as CEO with David Risher, a former Amazon executive, taking his place. While Risher has laid out ambitions to drive Lyft’s market share higher, we believe doing so will require more than a few quarters fix. Furthermore, while the company has looked for areas to right size their cost base, we see necessary investments in price, service levels and product differentiation to drive this turnaround further pushing out the path to improved profitability.”10. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $895,505,810Market Capitalization: $49.75 billionFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) has established a dedicated subsidiary known as Latitude AI solely focused on the development of autonomous driving technology. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker intends to bring together experts in the field of machine learning, operations, sensors, software, and systems engineering together for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has recorded over 50 million miles of hands-free driving through its Active Driving Assistance System, Ford BlueCruise.9. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $1,823,077,500Market Capitalization: $27.69 billionAptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is a Troy, Michigan-based automotive technology company focused on advanced safety, connectivity, and self-driving solutions for major automakers. The company has the distinction of rolling out autonomous ride-hailing services on a commercial level in the city of Las Vegas. As of 2023, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) has provided over 100,000 self-driving rides to the general public and claims it has received 100% ratings from 98% of the customers.Here's what Artisan Partners said about one of the best autonomous driving stocks in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Along with Catalent, we ended our investment campaigns in Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) and Nasdaq during the quarter. Aptiv is a leading provider of safety, infotainment and electronic control components to the automotive market. Our view was that the company was well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular industry trends—the shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, autonomous driving and increased computing intensity in vehicles. Over our holding period, a volatile macro environment (pandemic, supply chain shortages) steadily weighed on the profit cycle despite the company’s strong new business announcements. Furthermore, we believe the company may be increasingly disadvantaged as leading auto manufacturers work around tier-one suppliers (such as Aptiv) to maximize profits and speed to market. While the profit cycle may ultimately take hold, we concluded that several of our semiconductor holdings (ON Semiconductor, Lattice Semiconductor and Monolithic Power Systems) offer stronger leverage to these important new auto trends and decided to exit the position.”8. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $2,513,405,900Market Capitalization: $44.82 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is betting heavily on autonomous vehicles as it anticipates generating annual revenue of $50 billion through its Cruise autonomous vehicle division by 2030.

Of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database at the end of Q2 2023, 72 funds reported owning a stake in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).7. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $2,303,052,600Market Capitalization: $120.17 billionQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a San Diego, California-based chipmaker that is targeting the autonomous vehicle industry through the Snapdragon Ride platform. The platform integrates multiple critical components for self-driving, including cameras, radars, LIDAR processing, CUDA cores for neural network AI, functional safety capabilities, and autonomous driving software. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) claims that Snapdragon Ride delivers over 700 trillion operations per second to run deep learning-based perception and planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has secured the seventh position on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $6,517,644,300Market Capitalization: $777.25 billionTesla, Inc.

The platform’s capabilities include auto lane changing, automated parking, stopping at traffic lights and stop signs, and highway autopilot features.Here's what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:Many factors contributed to the strong performance of our largest Disruptive Growth position, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), in the period. Investors’ concerns regarding Tesla in 2022 continue to dissipate, and the company’s business has continued to grow materially, although at below peak margins. Tesla’s deliveries in China are recovering. The company’s newest factory in Texas has ramped production and should contribute to improved domestic sales and margins. U.S. government policies have lowered the cost to own Tesla vehicles, while also reducing the company’s battery production expenses.We continue to believe that Tesla is only scratching the surface of its potential. We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers. EV adoption is at a tipping point. And Tesla, with its approximately 60% domestic market share of EVs, should be the most important beneficiary of this shift…”  (Click here to read the full text)In addition to Tesla, Inc.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals spurned the agency's claims.The judge said in Tuesday's order that the consumer plaintiffs were trying to amend or revive matters of evidence that stemmed from a prior stage of the case and had since closed.A ruling favoring the plaintiffs, the judge said, ""would open the flood gates to prolonged do-over litigation."" Corley wrote that ""the court, in its discretion, chooses not to do so.""Joseph Cotchett, an attorney for the consumers, said they disagreed with the court's order and planned to appeal it.San Diego-based Qualcomm also had no immediate comment on Wednesday.Qualcomm has denied any wrongdoing and had asked the judge to reject the consumers' claims.The consumers' case was in Corley's court following a 9th Circuit ruling in 2021 that struck down an order certifying a nationwide consumer class action.In January, Corley dismissed core antitrust elements of the plaintiffs' claims but let the case move forward.Lawyers for Qualcomm argued the plaintiffs had no evidence in the record of the case showing that ""any alleged exclusive dealing agreement"" harmed consumers.The consumers' lawyers told Corley that ""Qualcomm turns a blind eye to the massive evidentiary record"" backing the consumers' allegations of exclusive dealing.Story continuesCorley said the plaintiffs should not get a new chance and ""more years of overly expensive litigation"" to pursue a different opinion on Qualcomm's alleged liability than one that had been alleged earlier.The case is In re: Qualcomm Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 3:17-md-02773.For plaintiffs: Kalpana Srinivasan of Susman Godfrey; and Joseph Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthyFor Qualcomm: Robert Van Nest of Keker, Van Nest &amp; Peters; Gary Bornstein of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore; and Richard Taffet of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry in 2023, go directly and see 10 Best Places To Visit in the USA in October.According to an assessment by Deloitte, as companies and organizations struggle to find their footing in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global tourism industry is under unprecedented pressure. After a period of stable expansion within the industry, the growth of the global travel sector, especially in some of the the best places to visit in the USA, was bogged down by worsening financial confidence in the final months of 2022. Within such a tenuous macroeconomic global climate, business leaders are incentivized to stabilize their operational capabilities and brace for an uncertain future. To read more about the tourism industry and its overall outlook in 2023, check out our article on World Tourism Rankings by Country: Top 20 Countries.US International Travel Recovery: An AnalysisAccording to an article by Bloomberg, the United States is falling behind the global travel rebound, with international tourists remaining at 26% below pre-pandemic levels, even in some of the best places to visit in the USA. Furthermore, according to a monthly report by the US Travel Association, average travel spending has also seen a significant decline, remaining at $99 billion at the end of 2022, just over 52% of where it stood in 2019. According to US Travel's CEO Geoff Freeman:“The lag is very significant, and we are very concerned. We estimate that this year alone we’re going to lose about 2.6 million international visitors and $7 billion less in spending. The US travel industry isn’t expected to recover to 2019 levels until 2025. Those two additional years will translate into billions of dollars of lost spending, of lost jobs.”According to Bloomberg, one of the primary obstacles affecting travel companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in the United States is the State Department's US visa processing time. As of July 2023, visa wait times tended to remain north of 400 days for first-time applicants from top markets which do not qualify for visa waivers. This is put into perspective by the fact that in 2019, tourists requiring visa entry into the US made up for more than 49% of all inbound international travel. Furthermore, according to the article, hotel rates in some of the best places to visit in the United States remain one of the highest in the world since the international travel rebound. These prices, coupled with high travel costs and strong inflation rates, are one of the most significant deterrents keeping international travelers at bay. Moreover, tourists are also dealing with delays getting through customs and security at airports, and with TSA wait times projected to increase in 2023, any tailwinds for the US from the global travel rebound remains a pipedream.Story continuesOne of the main reasons cited by Freeman for the travel lag in some of the best places to visit in the USA is the growing perception that the country is no longer safe. Increasing crime rates, homelessness in major cities, and frequent news of mass shootings have terrified potential tourists into staying weary of the United States for travel. Furthermore, the growing number of anti-LGBTQ legislations in the US, coupled with the Supreme Court's reversal of the Roe v. Wade verdict, have negatively impacted perceptions of the United States in foreign markets.The Chinese Travel Rebound: Implications for Global TourismHowever, the United States can draw some optimism from the travel rebound in China. According to an article by McKinsey, China is steadily doing away with travel restrictions, both domestically and internationally, leading to projections of a strong global demand for international tourism. According to the article, the Chinese domestic travel industry is already witnessing a strong resurgence, with the last New Year holidays witnessing more than 308 million domestic trips and generating more than $51.4 billion in tourism revenue. This sudden surge highlights the fact that domestic travel volume has reached 90% of 2019 figures, while tourist spending has returned to 70% of pre-pandemic levels. McKinsey proceeds to shed light upon the spending behaviors and preferences of Chinese travelers and how the global travel industry can prepare for their return.Before the pandemic arrived in 2019, China boasted the largest outbound travel market not only to some of  the best places to visit in the USA, but in the world. In 2019, Chinese tourists undertook more than 150 million outbound trips and made for more than $255 billion in travel spending. Furthermore, the country is also an integral source market for major destinations; for instance, Chinese tourists constitute more than 28% of inbound tourism in Thailand, 30% in Japan, and 16% of non-EU visitors to Germany. Chinese leisure tourists represented more than 65% of all travelers in 2019. Hence, when this massive outflow of tourism was ceased post the pandemic, the blow to the global tourism industry was massive. As McKinsey points out, the tourism rebound in China spells huge opportunities for tourism companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) across the world.However, the road to recovery for Chinese outbound tourism is still murky. Whilst most Chinese tourists express a strong desire to travel, the need for expensive COVID-19 testing, coupled with rising ticket prices, risk appetites of destination countries, and restrictions in getting passports and visas can deter tourists from international travel. Furthermore, travel recovery may also be heavily contingent upon airline capacity. Some international airlines have been slow to restore capacity, especially due to the labor shortage. To read more on the labor shortage affecting the global travel industry in 2023, check out our article on the 30 Most Expensive Cities to Visit in the US. By August 2023, international airline seat capacity had only returned to around 42% of pre-pandemic levels causing tourists to experience elevated ticket prices per seat. Price sensitive tourists often tend to wait for ticket prices to fall before booking international visits. Moreover, more than 20% of Chinese tourists have had their passports expire since the outset of the pandemic in 2019 and the Chinese government had not resumed passport renewals up until early 2023. Although renewals have since resumed, the huge backlog of applications will severely restrict the travel rebound for the rest of 2023. This might also lead to visas for destination countries getting delayed.Additionally, companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) would benefit by understanding that over the course of the pandemic, the average Chinese tourist had been travelling domestically. During this period, the domestic market evolved, and tourists became more sophisticated as they tried different leisure experiences like beach resorts, skiing trips and ""staycations"" in home cities. Therefore, the post-pandemic Chinese traveler is more digitally informed, experience oriented, and demands exploration. Although economic optimism is in the midst of a global decline, more than half of Chinese tourists reported, in a survey conducted by McKinsey, that they are optimistic about international travel in 2024.Copyright: starryvoyage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 35 best places to visit in the USA in October, we decided to use a variety of third-party research. We first shortlisted some of the most visited destinations in the United States based on data from different blogs and websites, which reported on the top travel destinations in the US (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Then, we developed a unique evidence based criteria to evaluate each destination for inclusion in the list: weather, based on data from the NOAA (5 points); natural beauty, based on Reddit threads (1,2) (4 points); budget considerations, based on data from Numbeo (3 points); outdoor activities, based on individual Reddit threads (2 points); and accessibility, based on information from TripAdvisor (1 point). We proceeded to score each destination according to the aforementioned criteria and selected thirty five destinations which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each destination based on the total points they scored, from lowest to highest.

At Expedia Group, we know that the global travel industry must transform to realize a Net Zero future, and we are committed to playing our part.As a step toward realizing that commitment, we are excited to release our first Climate Action Plan. Expedia Group has been carbon neutral since 2017, and we are now increasing our ambitions and committing to reach Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2040, from a 2022 base year.We are committing to the Science-Based Targets initiative and propose initial near-term targets, including:Reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 75% by 2030.Continuing to match 100% of our electricity usage with renewable purchases through 2030.Engaging with our value chain to ensure that 75% of our suppliers by emissions have also set science-based targets by 2028.Additionally, the plan contains a more robust greenhouse gas inventory for our operations, and an assessment of the risks and opportunities posed to our business by climate change. In the year to come, we will build on the vision set out in the Climate Action Plan by:Establishing an internal, cross-functional climate governance and oversight through a Net Zero working group.Developing a detailed Net Zero Roadmap that outlines how we will achieve our interim and long-term targets.Integrating a climate lens into the strategic planning processes and KPIs of relevant teams across our business.Beyond our operations, we are committed to catalyzing the wider travel industry's ability to achieve the global goal of halving emissions by 2030 and reaching Net Zero as soon as possible before 2050, as set out by The Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism, which we signed in 2022.Powering more sustainable journeysFrom day one, our business has been built on providing trusted information to travelers, connecting them with a wide range of quality travel products, and supporting suppliers in meeting our travelers' diverse range of needs. This is likewise where we will anchor our contribution to a Net Zero future for the global travel and tourism industry.Story continuesIn our Climate Action Plan, we outline our commitment to ensuring travelers are able to choose relatively more sustainable options, with the goal of making lower-carbon travel and tourism products a preferred choice across our platform and eventually the default for the global industry. We know this is important to travelers, as sustainability-related terms, like references to solar panels, recycling, or the elimination of single-use plastics, have recently doubled in how often they are mentioned in traveler reviews.In support of the commitment to provide travelers with information, we have launched a number of new sustainability-related features on our platform over the last year, such as showing information about the average carbon emissions of flights, or the eco-certifications received by hotels. And we are already seeing an impact - for example, a filter for electric vehicle chargers at hotel and vacation rental properties has become quite popular.Supporting responsible travelOur Climate Action Plan further articulates our commitment to supporting suppliers in offering more sustainable tourism to travelers, while enhancing resilience and climate adaptation for destination communities.To that end, we are thrilled to announce alongside our Climate Action Plan the launch of the new Nature Positive Tourism Fund, founded in partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), a global non-profit.The fund will demonstrate how tourism can be a force for environmental conservation and climate action as well as community development.The Fund aims to:Provide local people and organizations with working capital loans at below-market rates, as well as grants and access to technical experts, to improve product quality and tourist experience of nature positive tourism infrastructure, operations, and services; and support the transition away from fossil fuels.Identify and improve best practices and standards in nature positive tourism in collaboration with key stakeholders across the industry, including Indigenous peoples and local communities.Expand nature positive tourism opportunities in the critically important conservation areas where WCS works, including building community-owned and community-operated tourism facilities and services.We are excited to embark on this project with WCS and continue expanding our work. Together, we will show travelers the value of nature while ensuring nature positive tourism delivers economic value for the local people contributing to conservation efforts in these critical habitats.Looking aheadTravel broadens horizons, strengthens connections, and changes perspectives, bringing the world closer together.

Source: Skift SkiftTwo months after Expedia Group abruptly stopped providing Hopper with hotels and vacation rentals, Hopper announced Wednesday that it struck deals with two hotel bedbanks — Hotelbeds and WebBeds — to add more than 700,000 properties to its roster.In July, when Expedia announced it was terminating its Hopper relationship, Hopper stated that the breakup would have no impact on its business because the app-only online travel agency had many direct relationships with hotels. But the new deals show Hopper needed to fill a gap — and to bolster its global supply.Spain-based Hotelbeds will supply Hopper with 300,000 hotels, and Webbeds, which operates in Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, will chip in with 430,000, the companies said.Hopper stated that these hotels would be available to “all channels,” meaning the Hopper app, as well as distribution partners such as Capital One, which is a major Hopper investor. Hopper distribution partners may have also been feeling some pain from the Expedia break-up.Skift estimated in July that Expedia may have been providing half of Hopper’s roughly 2 million hotels. Expedia’s Vrbo had also been one of Hopper’s vacation rental providers.“We’re proud to partner with these two global, hotel contracting powerhouses,” said Dakota Smith, co-founder and president of Hopper. “Ensuring that travelers have transparency and optionality has always been at the core of Hopper’s offerings. Partnering with Hotelbeds and WebBeds will allow us to supercharge our efforts in building a best-in-class global hotel supply network.”Hopper stated that 65% of its hotel inventory in the U.S. comes from direct relationships with hotels, which reduces — but obviously doesn’t eliminate — the need to contract with third parties for hotel supply.When Expedia terminated its Hopper relationship, it alleged the way Hopper marketed its price freeze, or fintech, products was misleading and a disservice to travelers. Hopper rejects that claim, arguing it is providing a vital service to ease traveler anxiety over price volatility and travel disruptions.Story continuesFrederic Lalonde, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Hopper, will be speaking at Skift Global Forum 2023 on Thursday, September 28.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $163.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2025. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will procure spare engines, power modules, special test equipment and special tooling to support F135 propulsion systems from the 17th lot, for the F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-U.S. Department of Defense participants, cooperative program partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.Work related to this deal will be carried out in various locations within the continental U.S.RTX’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena. These jets also witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed has delivered 944 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 421 jets in the backlog as of Jun 25, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is likely to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster RTX’s top line.Story continuesPeer GrowthApart from Lockheed and RTX, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 have been discussed below.Northrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program. A pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft, NOC has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales indicates a year-over-year improvement of 5.7%.BAE Systems BAESY: This defense major’s short takeoff and vertical landing experience, along with air systems sustainment, supports F-35’s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35, which includes fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ.Details of the DealValued at $12.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will supply peculiar support equipment (PSE) and 29 nondestructive inspection (NDI) kits for the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G jets. These equipment will help mitigate deficient fleet quantities of PSE and NDI kits used to inspect and repair multiple components on these two aircraft.Work related to this deal will be carried out in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales implies a year-over-year improvement of 5.7%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT’s 2023 sales implies an improvement of 0.9% from the 2022 reported figure.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions.

The work related to the deal will be executed in East Hartford, CT.What’s Favoring RTX?The need to modernize military equipment and their capabilities has necessitated increased spending on defense and national security. This has contributed to the increased demand for military aircraft as well since they play a critical role in military missions.Such strong demand tends to benefit RTX Corp. as its Pratt &amp; Whitney business unit is an industry leader in the design, manufacture and maintenance of APUs and compact engines for powering military aircraft. The company also serves as a major supplier of gas turbine engines for a host of turboprops like the V-22 Osprey aircraft, as well as turbofan and turboshaft aircraft.RTX’s combat-proven product portfolio of APUs includes PW980, APS5000, APS3200 and a few more, which serve a wide range of military aircraft and thus enjoy strong demand. This results in several contract wins for the company for supplying APUs, like the latest one. Such a steady order inflow should bolster its revenue growth.Growth ProspectsPer the reports from the Coherent Market Insights firm, the military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.4% over the 2022-2030 period.

These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.

304,badacbbf-a14b-3004-be77-b31691a756d3,PHM,2023-09-28,Homebuilder stocks feeling the heat after rising rates,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/homebuilder-stocks-feeling-heat-rising-204057173.html,1695847257,VIDEO,"['LEN', 'LEN-B', 'DHI', 'PHM', 'XHB']","[The current interest rate environment is driving mortgage rates higher, which in turn are having their own effect on homebuilder stocks, such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), and PulteGroup (PHM). Many stocks across the homebuilding sector have been noted to be in a downturn since the Federal Reserve's rate pause last week.Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joins the show to break down how these stocks are performing amid elevated volatility.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, the rising rate environment driving mortgage rates above 7%. And while low inventory has supported homebuilder stocks, the reality of high rates is now weighing on shares. Jared Blikre is down on the floor right below us with details on this. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hi, Julie. There are some strange things going on in the market. To your point earlier in the show, this is what's happening on the Wi-Fi Interactive today in the homebuilders market. And you can see some red, some green there. But it's pretty clear, over the last seven days, lots of dark red here. Most of these tickers down about 5% like Toll Brothers, Lennar. DHI as well.And this includes that federal reserve meeting where we saw interest rates shoot higher. This is a 10-year-- this goes back to Wednesday last week. And you can see, from that meeting to here, we have risen quite a lot. And I think all of this will make a lot more sense if we look at the 30-year mortgage rate, which I have right here in cyan along with XHB. And that is the S&amp;P-- that's the S&amp;P homebuilders market.So here, we had these low rates in 2020, 2021. We saw this huge rise in XHB. Lots of fundamental reasons for that over the pandemic. Lots of people moving their residences. Then we saw an inverse relationship take hold, where we saw these rising rates-- 1, 2, 3. And then 1, 2, 3. We saw the opposite reaction in the homebuilders.Story continuesAnd then on this latest spurt up in the homebuilders, that was done actually with rising rates here. Why would that be? I think it's because we've put in this top here, and then we backed off of it. And we didn't really see XHB. We didn't see the homebuilders take a hit until we broke to new highs. And that was very recently, actually about a month or two ago in this market that we're looking at.So I'm going to go back to our heat map. And I'm going to show the price action. This is over the last seven days. I want to show what's happened over the last month, because it gets even worse there. Here's two months. And you can see the drops from those highs. DHA-- DHI down about 15.8%.And just to your point, Julie, on the strange things going on in this market, when we have a market where one thing goes up and the other thing is supposed to go down, doesn't always happen on a daily basis. But you take the price action and the overall indices today. They seem to have gone up in the middle of the day-- in the middle of the day, retracing all their losses for no rhyme or reason.It's because of the enhanced volatility in the market. It gets into short gamma, really in the weeds. I'm not going to go there. But just to say that things are a bit more volatile and hinky than they have been in several months. So probably more of the same into the end of the month.JOSH LIPTON: All right. Thank you, Jared Blikre, for bringing us all the action from the floor of the NYSE.]"
305,0cc30bd8-73c5-3c46-b4f4-44d08391c567,PHM,2023-09-28,"Investors Heavily Search PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pultegroup-inc-130009564.html,1695819609,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned -8.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has lost 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 indicates a change of +0.8% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.04 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.4%. The $16.49 billion and $17.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.6% and +5.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $4.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.9%. The EPS surprise was +21.46%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JP Morgan JPM, Live Nation Entertainment LYV, PulteGroup PHM and Builders FirstSource BLDR.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:The End of Policy Rate Hikes? Global Week AheadA market moment most stock traders waited for finally arrived.Last week, major central banks spoke to the trading world.To communicate formally: They are near the end of policy rate hikes.At the end of this Global Week Ahead, for those developed economies?Fresh personal consumption data — from the U.S. and the Euro Area — sheds light on how progress is going, slowing personal consumer price inflation down with steep monetary policy rate hikes.In the emerging world, India's domestic debt enters a JP Morgan bond index.Meanwhile, smaller Southeast Asian central banks wrestle with a currency dilemma.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) The Fed's PCE measure of inflation is out on Friday, Sept. 29th.The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge lands on Sept. 29th, right after the central bank signaled it plans to keep interest rates higher for longer to tame price pressures.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 3.3% in the 12 months through July. The Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2% inflation target.In its latest decision on Wednesday, the Fed kept interest rates steady, but projected monetary policy will remain significantly tighter through 2024 than previously expected.Investors will also be watching events in Washington DC, where U.S. lawmakers are haggling over a spending bill with a Sept. 30 deadline to avert a potential government shutdown that could rattle markets.Story continues(2) Eurozone consumer price data is out on Friday, Sept. 29th, too.The European Central Bank has not called time on its battle against inflation, but markets are laser-focused on when it might. That means Eurozone consumer prices data on Sept. 29th has the potential to move markets significantly.Headline inflation in the euro area remains far above the ECB's 2% target but has been moving in the right direction.Consumer prices increased by 5.2% year on year in August, extending a downward trend that started last autumn.The ECB raised its deposit rate to a record 4% this month and revised up its inflation forecast for next year.But with the currency bloc's economy weakening, the central bank also hinted a pause, at least, was coming. A further decline in inflation will undoubtedly spur intense speculation about the timing of its first rate cut.(3) What happens to global oil prices? Is $100 a WTI barrel here shortly?After what has felt like a relentless period of cost-of-living crisis and rising interest rates, central banks are finally wrestling inflation into submission. Or so they thought.Oil prices — a major inflation variable that lies beyond the control of any policymaker — have risen above $90 a barrel to 10-month highs, serving as an unpleasant reminder that what goes down can also easily go up again.The key driver has been Saudi Arabia and Russia, which account for over 20% of global output, agreeing to extend production cuts through year-end, to align supply with demand.Most analysts agree the oil price would, in theory, have to remain higher for longer to really push up headline inflation. But the predictions of $100 oil are becoming louder. Central banks may not yet be able to declare the war on inflation over.(4) India joins the benchmark JP Morgan EM domestic bond index.India finally got the nod from JP Morgan to join its benchmark GBI-EM emerging market domestic bond index, which is followed by $236 billion of funds.The decision will draw billions of dollars into domestic fixed-income markets of the world's fifth largest economy, with official inclusion due in increments from July 2024 until India reaches the 10% mark.India began talks on including its debt in global indexes in 2019, but that ambition had been delayed by a number of factors, including its stance on capital gains taxes and local settlement.Its government bond markets — in which foreigners currently hold less than 2% of outstanding paper — could get another boost when fellow index provider FTSE Russell decides on Sept. 28th whether to add India to its emerging bonds benchmark.(5) Southeast Asia's central bank currency dilemma.Asian central banks have a dilemma: how to handle weakening economic growth and peaking inflation, while arresting the slide in currencies to maintain stability in their financial systems.The Bank of Indonesia kept rates steady for an eighth month on Thursday. Benign inflation might have argued for a cut, but Governor Perry Warjiyo emphasized currency stability was a deciding factor. The rupiah is at six-month lows and its yield premium over U.S. dollars has shrunk.The same day, the Philippine central bank prioritized support for the peso over economic growth running at its slowest in nearly 12 years in the second quarter, with a hawkish pause.The Bank of Thailand meets on Sept. 27th and is likely to stay hawkish, forced by the beleaguered baht, despite wide twin deficits and a struggling economy.Heavy currency-market intervention has been one tactic. But much may rest on decisions of other central banks further afield, namely the Federal Reserve.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks(1) Live Nation Entertainment: This $80 a share stock in the Leisure and Recreation industry has a $18.8B market cap.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend Aristocrats are a select group of publicly traded companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. These companies are mainly known for their financial stability and the ability to generate consistent cash flows, which allows them to sustain and grow their dividend payments even during economic downturns. While dividend stocks haven't performed as well as the overall market this year, their attractiveness and advantages are pulling investors back toward them. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has gained 0.04% this year so far and its 12-month returns came in at 9.27%, as of September 25.One of the main reasons for the growing appeal of dividend stocks is the power of compounding. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividends have played a vital role in the profits investors have made over the past 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total gains in the S&amp;P 500 Index can be traced back to the practice of reinvesting dividends and the power of compounding. The report also mentioned that between 1930 and 2022, dividend income typically made up 41% of the total return from the S&amp;P 500 Index.Dividend stocks are mainly defensive. Despite everything that has occurred this year, such as the regional banking issues, it's important not to overlook how well the Aristocrats performed last year. They had a negative return of 6.5%, which was much better than the S&amp;P 500's negative return of 18%. Furthermore, the Aristocrats also offered some protection from the bond market's significant losses in various asset categories. In 2022, when investors were concerned about the stock valuations, high dividend funds did well because they offered attractive yields to income-seeking investors.Story continuesAlso Read: S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Analyst RatingsSimeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, spoke to Barron’s about the benefits of dividend aristocrat stocks, which include their history of raising dividends, financial stability, and solid cash generation. He also highlighted that in the second quarter, while earnings for companies in the S&amp;P 500 decreased by nearly 6% compared to the previous year, the Aristocrats saw an average earnings increase of about 10%, according to Bloomberg data. Here are some remarks from the analyst:“The ability [of the Aristocrats] to grow those earnings in an earnings recession and the ability to crank that out without using a lot of capital is the tangible benefit of quality.”Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend Aristocrats are a select group of publicly traded companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. These companies are mainly known for their financial stability and the ability to generate consistent cash flows, which allows them to sustain and grow their dividend payments even during economic downturns. While dividend stocks haven't performed as well as the overall market this year, their attractiveness and advantages are pulling investors back toward them. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has gained 0.04% this year so far and its 12-month returns came in at 9.27%, as of September 25.One of the main reasons for the growing appeal of dividend stocks is the power of compounding. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividends have played a vital role in the profits investors have made over the past 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total gains in the S&amp;P 500 Index can be traced back to the practice of reinvesting dividends and the power of compounding. The report also mentioned that between 1930 and 2022, dividend income typically made up 41% of the total return from the S&amp;P 500 Index.Dividend stocks are mainly defensive. Despite everything that has occurred this year, such as the regional banking issues, it's important not to overlook how well the Aristocrats performed last year. They had a negative return of 6.5%, which was much better than the S&amp;P 500's negative return of 18%. Furthermore, the Aristocrats also offered some protection from the bond market's significant losses in various asset categories. In 2022, when investors were concerned about the stock valuations, high dividend funds did well because they offered attractive yields to income-seeking investors.Story continuesAlso Read: S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Analyst RatingsSimeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, spoke to Barron’s about the benefits of dividend aristocrat stocks, which include their history of raising dividends, financial stability, and solid cash generation. He also highlighted that in the second quarter, while earnings for companies in the S&amp;P 500 decreased by nearly 6% compared to the previous year, the Aristocrats saw an average earnings increase of about 10%, according to Bloomberg data. Here are some remarks from the analyst:“The ability [of the Aristocrats] to grow those earnings in an earnings recession and the ability to crank that out without using a lot of capital is the tangible benefit of quality.”Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

This takes the annual payment to 1.5% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Republic Services Republic Services' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. However, prior to this announcement, Republic Services' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 31.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendRepublic Services Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.94 total annually to $2.14. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.6% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Earnings has been rising at 4.0% per annum over the last five years, which admittedly is a bit slow. While growth may be thin on the ground, Republic Services could always pay out a higher proportion of earnings to increase shareholder returns.Republic Services Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Republic Services that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of March 26, 2024.PAH is a rare, progressive and ultimately life-threatening disease characterized by the narrowing of blood vessels in the lungs, causing significant strain on the heart. The application for sotatercept is based on data from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, in which sotatercept on top of background therapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and eight of nine secondary outcome measures. These results were presented at ACC.23/WCC and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.""Despite advances in the treatment of PAH over the last two decades, there is still a significant need to improve outcomes for patients,"" said Dr. Joerg Koglin, senior vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""The FDA’s acceptance of this application is an exciting milestone in our journey to bring this novel activin signaling inhibitor to patients. Based on the profound improvements across primary and secondary outcome measures in the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, we believe sotatercept has the potential to transform the treatment of patients with PAH. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring sotatercept to patients in need.""Story continuesAbout STELLARSTELLAR (NCT04576988) was a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sotatercept in adult patients with PAH (WHO Group 1) being treated with background therapy with WHO Functional Class (FC) II or III. The primary endpoint of the study was exercise capacity, as measured by change from baseline in week 24 6MWD. Nine secondary endpoints, tested hierarchically in the following order, were multicomponent improvement, change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, improvement in WHO FC, time to clinical worsening or death, French risk score, and the PAH-SYMPACT® Physical Impacts, Cardiopulmonary Symptoms and Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain scores; all assessed at week 24 except clinical worsening, which was assessed when the last patient completed the week 24 visit.About pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive and life-threatening blood vessel disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries and elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Approximately 40,000 people in the U.S. are living with PAH. The disease progresses rapidly for many patients. PAH results in significant strain on the heart, leading to limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy. The five-year mortality rate for patients with PAH is approximately 43%.About sotaterceptSotatercept is a potential first-in-class activin signaling inhibitor biologic being studied for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1). PAH is a rare disease caused by hyperproliferation of cells in the arterial walls in the lung, leading to narrowing and abnormal constriction. In pre-clinical models, sotatercept has been shown to modulate vascular cell proliferation, reversing vascular and right ventricle remodeling.In addition to STELLAR, the sotatercept clinical development program includes multiple Phase 2 and 3 trials across a broad range of patients. Studies are underway in adult patients with PAH (WHO Group 1) at intermediate or high risk of disease progression or mortality, as well as with pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (WHO Group 2).Sotatercept has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as Priority Medicines designation and Orphan Drug designation by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of PAH. Merck acquired exclusive rights to sotatercept in the pulmonary hypertension field through the acquisition of Acceleron Pharma Inc.

321,c5ff8a7c-a9ba-38e1-a187-c1d7e9a8edaa,MRK,2023-09-28,"Merck & Co., Inc.'s (NYSE:MRK) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-nyse-mrk-130014798.html,1695819614,STORY,['MRK'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Merck's (NYSE:MRK) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.3% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Merck's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Merck How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Merck is:8.1% = US$3.1b ÷ US$39b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Merck's Earnings Growth And 8.1% ROEWhen you first look at it, Merck's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 22% either. Merck was still able to see a decent net income growth of 17% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Merck's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Merck is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Merck Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?While Merck has a three-year median payout ratio of 64% (which means it retains 36% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Besides, Merck has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 38% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 38%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, it does look like Merck has some positive aspects to its business. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty substantial, we do feel that the reinvestment rate is pretty low, meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

However, softer fertilizer prices may weigh on its top line and margins.The company’s shares are down 27.3% over a year compared with a 27.8% decline recorded by its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment.Healthy Demand, Cost Cuts Aid MOSMosaic is benefiting from strong demand for phosphate and potash. Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in the balance of 2023. Strong demand is expected to support the company’s sales volumes.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability.The company also remains committed to carrying out investments with high returns with moderate capital expenditures, such as the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at its Riverview facility, constructing a new blending and distribution center in Palmeirante, Brazil, executing the construction of a purified phosphoric acid plant for sale in North Americ, and installing a Hydrofloat flotation system at Esterhazy's K2 mill. The estimated total capital expenditures for 2023 are $1.3-$1.4 billion.Mosaic also aims to return substantial free cash flow in 2023 to shareholders. The company strives to maintain a healthy balance sheet.Softer Prices to Hurt MarginsWeaker prices for potash and phosphate may impact the company’s margins. Prices of phosphate and potash retreated since the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus. Lower selling prices hurt sales and margins across the company’s Phosphate and Potash segments in the second quarter of 2023. Despite some recovery of late, weaker year-over-year fertilizer prices are expected impact the company’s profitability in the third quarter of 2023.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, Hawkins, Inc.

323,696d4d0d-5570-3ad9-9eae-a42d0b4f7d5a,MOS,2023-09-28,15 Biggest Agricultural Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-agricultural-companies-us-205552537.html,1695761752,STORY,"['TSN', 'BG', 'MOS', 'ADM', 'AGCO', 'FMC', 'SEB', 'CTVA']","[In this article, we shall cover the 15 biggest agricultural companies in the US. To skip our detailed analysis of some of the risks and potentials affecting the American agricultural industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Biggest Agricultural Companies in the US.According to an outlook presented by the US Department of Agriculture in 2023, the US agricultural GDP is expected to reach up to $173 billion by 2026, up 0.6% annually since 2021. The market is estimated to have grown more than 2% year-on-year since 2002. Some of the  biggest agricultural companies in the American market today are Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN).Despite such impressive statistics, a recent article by McKinsey posits that even the biggest agricultural companies in the US are currently under immense pressure. Across the world, farmers complain that prices for agricultural input like fertilizer and crop protection chemicals are at an all-time high, currently rising by more than 250% over the past couple of years. Moreover, the exacerbation of the climate change crisis is introducing further problems, as rising temperatures are leading to increased weather variability, more frequent acute conditions, longer periods of drought, and new species of invasive crops and pests, all of which collectively is significantly reducing annual yields. In the American Southwest, for example, there is a massive drought underway for the past 20 years, and experts have claimed that the the 21st century has been the region's driest time period in at least 1200 years.Agricultural Automation Trends: An OverviewAccording to McKinsey, to release the increasing pressure on the agricultural industry in 2023 and to maintain economic viability, farmers are resorting to innovative, technological solutions. In this vein, automation is showing significant promise in curtailing the effects of the climate crisis and aiding agriculturalists mitigate the resulting financial blow. Automated farming solutions tend to exist on a diverse spectrum, ranging from semi-automated technologies like assisted steering to entirely automated systems like weeding robots, each requiring varying levels of operator support. The next generation of automated technology is using a combination of sensors, analytics, robotics, and equipment to help farmers make more informed decisions on the field and capitalize on all available resources. Furthermore, the advent of artificial intelligence presents significant potential to automate decision-making using comprehensive sets of already-attained data points. Automated technology presents significant upside to row and specialty crop producers. For example, the use of automated systems in agriculture presents an upside of more than $400 per acre per year, nearly quadrupling returns on farmers’ investments. Therefore, some of the biggest agricultural companies in the US like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN) have already begun a process of integrating and incorporating automated technological solutions to their operations.Story continuesHowever, according to McKinsey's Farmers Global Insights Survey 2022, less than 5 percent of farmers in North America are adequately investing in next generation technology. In the survey, McKinsey also highlights certain trends prevalent in the agricultural sector in 2023 which are likely to propel the adoption of automated technology in agricultural practice.A trend which is almost immediately evident is that farm economics are a constant source of trepidation for farmers. Automation can aid primarily in two fundamental respects. Firstly, since supply chain disruptions and geopolitical challenges have caused the prices of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals to skyrocket by more than 15% globally over five years, US farmers have begun to cite input costs as the number one risk to their profitability, according to the survey. To read more about the price hike in the fertilizer segment of the agriculture industry, check out our article on 10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Secondly, labor challenges are also proving to be a constant pain point for farmers, especially since farmworkers are at high risk of injuries and have one of the highest fatal occupational injury rates in the United States. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to chemicals and sun also adds to the perception that farm work is inherently dangerous. These labor shortages - especially in the United States where more than 22 million pounds of fruits and vegetables were wasted in 2022 due to worker shortage - have caused farmworker wages to rise by roughly four percent annually between 2015 to 2022. Automation can help ease these challenges significantly.Digitization in Agriculture: A Sustainable ApproachAccording to an article by McKinsey, agricultural land covers more than half of habitable land around the world and is responsible for more than seventy percent of freshwater withdrawal. Furthermore, food systems are the leading cause of biodiversity loss and have increasingly begun to negatively impact biosphere integrity, human health, and food access. In 2019, the global agriculture industry accounted for more than thirty percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, making them a critical focus for meeting bold climate targets. Hence, as the climate crisis assumes a higher priority for governments globally, investors are increasingly focused on companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG), and Tyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN), which have begun to implement sustainable transitions to curb agriculture's effects on nature and society beyond climate change.According to the article, achieving the objective of a 1.5° pathway will require actions by the biggest agricultural companies that extend throughout the value chain. Some of the more important actions to take are reducing food loss and waste, adopting dietary shifts, and adapting to a more sustainable usage of arable land, all of which are absolutely integral to decarbonization efforts. According to an article by Bloomberg, digital services have a strong interconnection with sustainability efforts in agriculture. As the public eye increasingly focuses on the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector, digital service providers are flocking in to market their platform's sustainability capabilities. The article posits that as farmers use digital services to monitor the administration of fertilizer, crop chemicals, and water, the efficiency of the entire process is substantially enhanced, thereby reducing the impact on emissions and ecology.In this effort, Bloomberg conducted a survey of digital platform owners, who maintained that digital monitoring of farming is essential to prove at scale the certification of regenerative farming practices that enhance soil health, organic carbon in the soil, and biodiversity promotion. Digitization of the farming process can also ensure supply chain transparency to promote sustainability and outcome-based pricing models, which incentivize a profound reduction in the use of agrochemicals.Vegetable FarmingPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 15 biggest agricultural companies companies in the U.S, we decided to look at a mix of both private and public companies.

324,d98d7417-f172-3070-b5ed-4907ca008f54,WMB,2023-09-28,Texas Pacific Land and Columbia Sportswear have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-pacific-land-columbia-sportswear-100600041.html,1695895560,STORY,"['COLM', 'WMB', 'KMI', 'MPLX']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Texas Pacific Land TPL as the Bull of the Day and Columbia Sportswear COLM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc WMB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Texas Pacific Land is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that engages in the land and resource management, and water services and operations businesses. The company provides holistic water services to oil and gas operators in the Permian Basin.As energy prices spiked in 2022, so did TPL, more than doubling in the first ten months of the year. However, as energy prices came in, so did TPL and the stock fell over 50%.Looking forward, bullish investors look to be in a good spot as energy prices are moving higher once more.More about Texas Pacific LandThe company was formed in 1888 and is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It employs about 100 people and has a market cap of $14 billion.The company is one of the largest landowners in Texas, holding approximately 874,000 acres of land in West Texas.TPL has two segments:Land and Resource Management- This segment focuses on managing TPL's oil and gas royalty interest and surface acres located in 19 different counties. Revenue streams include oil and gas royalties, easements, commercial sales, land sales, and material sales.Water Service and Operations- This segment offers operators service across the Permian Basin, focusing on water sourcing, gathering, treatment, recycling, disposal, tracking analytics, and well testing. It is also responsible for infrastructure and development.The stock has a Forward PE of 37 and the stock pays a dividend of just under 1%.Q2 EarningsTexas Pacific last reported earnings back in August, with a 17% EPS beat. Earnings were below last year, as revenue came in at $160.6M v the $176.3M y/y.Story continuesThis of course makes sense with lower energy prices, which pays out lower royalties. However, losses were largely offset by increased revenue from the business water sales and royalties' income.With the recent uptick in oil and natural gas, analysts are lifting estimates.Estimates Trend HigherLooking at earnings estimates, they are on the move higher since earnings.For the current quarter, numbers go up from $12.87 to $13.55 over the last 60 days. This is a hike of 5%.Next quarter we see a similar gain of 2%, with estimates going from 12.34 to $13.56 over that same time frame. Looking at a longer-term time frame it gets exciting.For the current year, we see estimates have ticked 6.5% over the last 60 days, going from $46.83 to $49.83. For next year we see a spike of 17%, with estimates going from $62.13 to $71.54.The Technical Take Investors had a tough time earlier this year as prices moved below all moving averages this summer. But after the recent rally in energy, the stock has rallied and stabilized around the level it started the year.For those looking for an entry, below are some levels to watch:21-day Moving Average (MA): $184050-day MA: $1760200-day MA: $1730In Summary Texas Pacific Land gives investors exposure to energy in a unique way. This historical company will benefit from the recent rise in energy prices and the desire of energy companies to utilize their land.After a rough ride earlier this year, the stock looks to have stabilized and is ready for a push higher into the end of the year. Investors should target any pullbacks to technical support and look for a good finish to 2023 if energy remains strong.Bear of the Day:Columbia Sportswear is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that designs, sources, markets, and distributes outdoor, active, and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. The company provides apparel, accessories, and equipment for mountaineering, climbing, skiing, and snowboarding, trail, and camp enthusiasts.The stock has not been kind to investors, down 20% on the year. As it trades near 2023 lows, it looks like more pain might be ahead after poor guidance and falling estimates. About the Company Columbia is headquartered in Portland, OR.The company was founded in 1938 and employs over 9,000 people.The company offers products under four well-established brands – Columbia, Sorel, Mountain Hardwear and prAna. The company sells its products through the company-owned network of branded and outlet retail stores, brand-specific e-commerce sites, and concession-based arrangements with third-parties at branded outlet and shop-in-shop retail locations, as well as through independently operated specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores, sporting goods chains, department store chains, internet retailers, and international distributors.Columbia is valued at $4 billion and has a Forward PE of 15. COLM holds Zacks Style Scores of ""C"" in Growth, ""D"" in Value, but ""D"" in Momentum. The stock pays a dividend of 1.7%.Q2 Earnings When Columbia reported earnings back in early August the headline looked great, with a 600% earnings beat. Q2 Revenue also beat, but the company cut guidance in a big way.The company sees Q3 at $1.60-1.70 v the $1.95 expected and sees net sales below expectations. Columbia also cut FY23 to a range of $4.40-4.65 v the $5.23 expected. Operating margins are seen lower and the company cut capex.Management said that because of trends they are seeing across the business, they are taking a conservative approach for the year. They are looking to manage expenses and looking for opportunities to drive growth.Despite the spin, analysts had to cut estimates because of the guide lower.EstimatesOver the last 60 days, estimates have dropped from $1.95 to $1.68 for the current quarter. The 14% move lower is not as bad as the next quarter, which has dropped 19%.Looking longer term, analysts have lowered estimates by 12% for the current year and 8% for next year.Technical TakeLooking at the chart there is not much to like. The stock is trading below all its major moving averages and almost 30% off 2023 highs.There will likely be support in the mid $60s, but if that fails the COVID lows at $55 is the next stop.SummaryColumbia has clearly lost steam over the last couple of months and the short term does not look great fundamentally. The chart is confirming that story as the stock trades at 2023 lows.Additional content:Energy Market Volatility Bothering You? Watch These 3 StocksThe initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $90 per barrel. Focus on supply tightness and the possibility of a soft landing for the U.S. economy is primarily aiding the recent crude rally.Thus, it's pretty apparent that the business model of most energy players, by nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to keep an eye on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc., MPLX LP and The Williams Companies Inc.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices than oil and gas producers. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Hence, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well-poised to gain, and hence, investors should keep an eye on these stocks. While MPLX and The Williams Companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Kinder Morgan has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks to GainKinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan is poised to grow on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.MPLX: The firm has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year. Under its unit repurchase authorization, the partnership has yet to buy back the remaining $846 million of its units.The Williams Companies: It is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. WMB's assets can meet 30% of the nation's consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

326,b40f159e-cd80-3752-9e7a-34227b93bba4,BA,2023-09-28,Ryanair sends holiday plans into disarray as it announces flight cancellations,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b40f159e-cd80-3752-9e7a-34227b93bba4/ryanair-sends-holiday-plans.html,1695891891,STORY,"['RYA', 'RYAAY', 'BA']","[Europe’s largest airline has a fleet of more than 550 aircraft - ADRIAN DENNIS/AFPRyanair has thrown holiday plans into disarray for up to 1.4m passengers as it cancelled flights across its winter schedule.Europe’s largest airline blamed delays in new aircraft deliveries from Boeing for the cancellations, which will take effect from the end of October.It is not yet known how many flights will be hit. But Peel Hunt analyst Alex Paterson estimated that it would affect at least 1.4m passengers.The Irish carrier did not comment on the figure but confirmed that a minimum of 10 airliners from its fleet of 550 across Europe will be unavailable for its winter 2023 schedule.The airline said reductions in its flight schedule were “unavoidable” because it has no spare aircraft due to scheduled maintenance.Mr Paterson said:  “Ryanair operates a very low-cost carrier model where high utilisation is critical.”Michael O’Leary, the chief executive, said: “At this early date, we do not expect these delivery delays will materially affect our full-year traffic target of 183.5m.“But if the delays worsen or extend further into the January to March 2024 period, we may have to revisit this figure and possibly adjust it slightly downward.”Jets based at eight airports around Europe including Dublin, Naples, East Midlands and Cologne will be removed from service for vital maintenance work.Extra maintenance groundings are set to be confirmed at another three Ryanair bases.Mr O’Leary said at a press conference on Wednesday: “As long as Boeing don’t delay any more deliveries, we will get to 183.5m passengers.“Pre-Covid we did 149m passengers so we’re operating nearly 30pc more than we did three years ago.”The airline said affected passengers who had booked cancelled flights will be notified “in the coming weeks” and offered alternative flights or refunds.Ryanair had expected to receive 27 aircraft from Boeing over the next three months but production delays mean it only expects to take delivery of 14 new airliners between September and December.Story continuesThe airline apologised for the cancelled flights, highlighting delays at Boeing subcontractor Spirit Aerosystems’ fuselage factory in Wichita, Kansas.In summer Spirit acknowledged a “quality issue” at the factory, saying in mid-August “we believe there will not be a material impact to our delivery range for the year related to this issue.”Boeing said: “We value our partnership with Ryanair and are committed to supporting them.”The airliner-maker said issues had also been caused by repair and delivery setbacks at its own plant in Seattle.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

As they cycled, walked, and even ran their way up this challenging mountain pass in the Italian Alps, they did so with a singular purpose: to support an organization working to advance research into personalized cancer treatments.At Illumina, our mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome guides everything we do, from business decisions to our corporate citizenship program activities. Our people are committed to giving back to the communities where we live and work and are passionate about connecting to our mission. And we are not afraid of a little sweat.The hike aims to raise awareness and funding for the Stelvio for Life Foundation. This foundation is unwavering in its commitment to supporting the cancer research carried out by the Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment (CPCT) in the Netherlands. At its core, this research seeks to revolutionize cancer treatment by harnessing the power of DNA analysis. In recent years, the CPCT has conducted groundbreaking studies, including the Drug Rediscovery Protocol trial, a nationwide clinical research effort that matched patients with targeted therapies based on specific DNA alterations identified through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) performed by the Hartwig Medical Foundation.These initiatives have shown great promise in offering cancer patients more effective treatment options tailored to their individual genetic makeup. In fact, evidence generated by the CPCT was fundamental in the Dutch government's decision to reimburse WGS as standard of care for patients facing cancers of unknown primary diagnosis.The 2023 hike drew participants from diverse backgrounds and regions and united them under a common cause. The same dedication of Illumina's 11 employees was reflected in the hundreds of other people who took part, further highlighting the strength of the international community's commitment to finding innovative solutions to cancer.Story continues""It was a great couple of days,"" says cyclist Chris Zwanenburg, an Illumina executive sales specialist based in the Netherlands. ""The spirit was high, and everyone was energized to climb and overcome this giant of a mountain. We were all very proud to see the Illumina banners and logo all over the place. It was a clear message that both employees and the company are supporting this incredible cause so close to our hearts.""The outcome was equally impressive on the financial front. Participants were encouraged to raise one euro for every meter of altitude they climbed, and the event raised a total of 23,000€ for cancer research. This journey up the Passo dello Stelvio aligns with the Illumina Corporate Foundation and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program's commitment to deepening the company's impact on human health, community, and our planet.Illumina's CSR initiatives extend beyond financial contributions. Employees are actively involved in giving back through volunteer opportunities, a matching donation program, and volunteer rewards. This enables employees to connect with causes that both resonate with them personally and align with the company's mission, like Stelvio for Life. For those who participated and those who donated, the event was proof that, united by a shared purpose, individuals can help create a better future for all those affected by cancer.Illumina employees and partners gather on Via Ezio Vanoni in Bormio, the evening before the event.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, from a first glance at Southern (NYSE:SO) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Southern, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.046 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$137b - US$13b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Southern has an ROCE of 4.6%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 4.5% average generated by the Electric Utilities industry. Check out our latest analysis for Southern roceIn the above chart we have measured Southern's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Southern.So How Is Southern's ROCE Trending?There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Southern. The company has employed 26% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 4.6%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.The Bottom Line On Southern's ROCEIn conclusion, Southern has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 91% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesIf you'd like to know more about Southern, we've spotted   4 warning signs,  and 2 of them are significant.While Southern isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $163.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2025. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will procure spare engines, power modules, special test equipment and special tooling to support F135 propulsion systems from the 17th lot, for the F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-U.S. Department of Defense participants, cooperative program partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.Work related to this deal will be carried out in various locations within the continental U.S.RTX’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena. These jets also witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed has delivered 944 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 421 jets in the backlog as of Jun 25, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is likely to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster RTX’s top line.Story continuesPeer GrowthApart from Lockheed and RTX, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 have been discussed below.Northrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales indicates a year-over-year improvement of 5.7%.BAE Systems BAESY: This defense major’s short takeoff and vertical landing experience, along with air systems sustainment, supports F-35’s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35, which includes fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.

Wall Street analysts expect the sports apparel giant to post revenue of approximately $13 billion for the quarter with earnings per share forecasted at $0.75 on an adjusted basis. In addition, analysts estimate Nike's gross margin for the quarter to come in at 43.7%, compared to 44.3% in the same period last year.Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer previews Nike's first-quarter earnings and gives insights into what could impact these earnings.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: Nike set to report its quarterly results after the bell on Thursday. And here to break down what Wall Street is looking for from that retailer is Yahoo Finance's own Josh Schafer. Josh.JOSH SCHAFER: Hey, Josh. Yeah, so we got Nike set to report earnings after the bell on Thursday. And I want to just run through the numbers first that we are expecting from the retail giant. When you take a look at what we're expecting for Nike on a revenue basis, we're expecting nearly $13 billion in revenue. That's what the Street's expecting. Now, that's versus $12.69 billion in the same period last year.On an adjusted EPS basis, we're expecting Nike to report $0.75 of adjusted earnings. That's actually down from what they reported in the same period last year. Last year, Nike reported $0.93 of EPS in that first quarter. And then when you take a look at gross margins, the estimate is for a gross margin of 43.7%. That is also down from what Nike reported last year at 44.3%.So clearly, analysts expecting not necessarily a slowdown for Nike on the top line, but certainly some of these headwinds to come to play for the retailer, some of those headwinds that we think about when we think about the Nike story right now. A general consumer slowdown in North America, is that starting to materialize for Nike? Last quarter, they said it wasn't. Do we hear a little bit different commentary on that earnings call? I'm going to be interested to hear that.Story continuesThen with Nike, of course, we always think about China, right? China's been a big part of Nike's growth story. They do almost $2 billion a quarter in China alone. But China has struggled coming out of COVID, and it hasn't been as robust as people had thought. That's weighed on shares. What do we hear about greater China tomorrow is a big part of that story.And then a final thing that I'm curious about when it comes to Nike is what they say about wholesale. Nike is a big, big part of Foot Locker's business. And we know Foot Locker has struggled this year. Over half of Foot Locker sales are Nike shoes. Foot Locker is struggling, does that mean they're buying less Nike shoes and, therefore, Nike's wholesale department is struggling a little bit? Analysts right now are expecting Nike's wholesale revenue to fall 4% in the quarter. That's going to be a closely watched number tomorrow after the bell.JULIE HYMAN: Right. If it makes up for it in direct-to-consumer or if it's still relying on wholesale, really a lot of interesting questions around Nike. Thanks for laying it all out for us so comprehensively, Josh Schafer. Appreciate it.]"

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 5/10Profitability rank: 5/10Growth rank: 0/10GF Value rank: 2/10Momentum rank: 4/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned VF Corp the GF Score of 55 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Snapshot of VF Corp's BusinessVF Corp, with a market cap of $6.68 billion, designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its portfolio includes renowned brands like Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies.

The company, which traces its roots to 1899, has grown through multiple acquisitions.Story continuesVF Corp (VFC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisVF Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 1.34, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.1 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.9, which is worse than 94.96% of 913 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 15.63, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 92.25% of 774 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Profitability AnalysisVF Corp's low Profitability rank can also raise warning signals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 2, VF Corp's financial health appears concerning. This score, rooted in Joseph Piotroski's nine-point scale, evaluates a firm's profitability, liquidity, and operating efficiency. Given its rating, VF Corp might be facing challenges in these areas.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where VF Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Lastly, VF Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.VF Corp (VFC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven VF Corp's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. It's crucial for investors to consider these factors when making investment decisions. Will VF Corp be able to overcome these challenges and return to its former glory?

Zions’ recent strong rally, up over 70% since May lows, has brought its valuation in line with industry peers, ending a period of consistent discount trading throughout 2023.“We believe this skews risk-reward to the downside in a higher for longer rate environment given the elevated risk of NIB outflow which would need to be replaced with higher cost client deposits currently off-balance sheet,” mentioned Morgan Stanley.Valley National cut to UnderweightMorgan Stanley downgraded Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $8.50 (from $8.00), as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.We think Consensus is underestimating the pressure on Valley's NII in a higher for longer rate environment. VLY has a 101% loan-to-deposit ratio (vs. ~84% for peers) which gives them less flexibility on deposit pricing in a higher for longer rate environment.Three more downgradesGordon Haskett downgraded Macy’s (NYSE:M) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $13.00 from $18.00.CFRA downgraded Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $42.00 from $51.00.Gordon Haskett downgraded Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $215.00.

This will diversify the client market served by private credit and direct lending. The fund will also pursue other transactions, including traditional sponsor-backed direct lending opportunities.Of the $5 billion, anchor investors, including wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, will commit around $2 billion in initial equity commitments. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo will be a minority investor in the initiative and offer the loans to existing customers as an alternative to other financing options.The fund will leverage Wells Fargo’s long-term relationships, extensive client network and preeminent position in the U.S. middle market and asset-based lending space.Particularly, loans from direct-lending funds often carry a higher interest rate than traditional bank loans, making it attractive for private capital providers. Moreover, with higher interest rates and tight credit conditions, banks have also been eyeing opportunities to tap the market. Stricter regulation and increased costs have compelled banks to re-evaluate the types of loans and services they provide. Hence, the move is a strategic fit for WFC.Per WFC management, “As a leader in U.S. middle market and asset-based lending, we are continually focused on finding ways to best serve our clients, and Overland can offer them options for alternative capital structures that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions.”Centerbridge Partners noted, “We believe Overland draws on the unique and complementary capabilities of both Centerbridge’s leading private credit underwriting capabilities and Wells Fargo’s nationwide sourcing and origination network to offer an attractive new proposition for borrowers in the private lending and direct credit space at a particularly compelling time.”Story continuesOver the past six months, shares of Wells Fargo have gained 9.4% compared with the industry’s rise of 1.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, WFC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bank Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks in the banking space are First Business Financial Services, Inc. FBIZ and Southside Bancshares, Inc. SBSI.The consensus estimate for First Business Financial Services’ current-year earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.

The new feature enables Spanish-speaking customers to take advantage of the solution that is already providing a more personalized, convenient, and simple banking experience to customers using the Wells Fargo Mobile® app on their smartphones.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230927306717/en/Wells Fargo’s Virtual Assistant, Fargo, Expands Capabilities with Spanish-Language Feature (Photo: Wells Fargo)""Seeing the volume of Fargo interactions since it went live earlier this year demonstrates that our customers are finding value in an in-your-pocket financial assistant to manage their banking experience,"" said Michelle Moore, head of Digital for Consumer and Wealth &amp; Investment Management at Wells Fargo. ""Managing finances can oftentimes be complex if a customer isn’t well-versed in how to measure how they are spending, saving, or budgeting – now available to the second largest language population of our customers.""Between 2010 and 2020, the U.S. Latino population grew by 23%, now making up 20% of the national population and continuing to grow1. In addition, income and wealth among Latinos are growing faster than the broader population, with median family wealth growing nearly three times faster than the typical U.S. household over the last decade2. Offering a Spanish-language capability that can provide details and context about a customer’s financial journey – to the same extent the English-language solution can – improves accessibility to our growing Latino customer base. To ensure the Spanish-language capability is as comprehensive as possible, Wells Fargo leveraged the knowledge of its Spanish-speaking employees representing over a dozen Spanish-speaking countries to test, train, and fine-tune Fargo to understand a number of different regional language differences and dialects.Story continuesNow, customers who set their language preference to Spanish can input requests to Fargo and receive instant access to their banking details. Just by talking or typing into their smartphone in Spanish, customers can request Fargo to complete a multitude of tasks including checking their spending insights and credit score, viewing rates and fees, managing their spending limits, and transferring money.Since its launch, Fargo has facilitated millions of interactions with customers who are using it to navigate their transactions, manage their card limits, search for their routing numbers, and obtain insights into their spending. In the coming months, Fargo will continue to roll out new capabilities that provide a more sophisticated financial experience. The rollout will leverage predictive analytics to enable meaningful conversations that learn and adapt to each individual customer, and deliver proactive insights for a number of different items including:A spending digest that delivers proactive push notifications to the customer about increases in spending with insights on which spending categories are seeing increases;Monitoring customer deposits and delivering insights and guidance on where to allocate that money depending on the financial goals they have set;Monitoring subscriptions and other recurring transactions in addition to providing the option to cancel or pause subscriptions;Analyzing spending habits and sharing proactive projections for anticipated balances; andSimplifying budgeting, by calculating how much someone can safely spend, while still covering their bills and hitting their savings targets.Today’s announcement marks a continuation of Wells Fargo’s holistic digital transformation, as signified by the rollout of a new consumer mobile app last year, and the development of Fargo, its new virtual assistant. These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of many initiatives in Wells Fargo’s multiyear plan to become digital-first and reinvent personal finance.

The world learned about messenger RNA molecules and their flexibility, speed and power during the COVID-19 battle. Although this virus is still present, mRNA vaccines helped the world cope with this unprecedented health challenge and move on. But this technology is also being tested for use in the battle against rare diseases and even cancer. Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: MYNZ), a molecular genetics diagnostic company specializing in the early detection of cancer just announced it will be presenting groundbreaking results from its ColoFuture study that assessed the potential of mRNA biomarkers in colorectal cancer test screening at the 4th International Conference on Gastroenterology.Mainz Biomed To Present Its Groundbreaking ResultsDr. Moritz Eidens will be speaking about a novel and non-invasive mRNA and AI based early Colorectal Cancer and Advanced Adenoma detection approach. Dr. Eidens will be presenting a detailed first interim data review of the international COLOFUTURE case control study during the International Conference on Gastroenterology that will be taking place in Paris, France, from October 16th to 18th.Promising Trial ResultsMainz Biomed conducted a multi-center international clinical trial with the aim to assess the potential to integrate a portfolio of novel gene expression (mRNA) biomarkers into ColoAlert®, a screening test for CRC. The results were more than encouraging. Novel gene expression biomarkers demonstrated sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 94% with specificity of 97% and advanced adenoma sensitivity of 81%. Currently marketed in Europe, Mainz Biomed is conducting a pivotal FDA clinical study for U.S. regulatory approval, while also developing PancAlert, an early-stage pancreatic cancer screening test.Story continuesA New Era Of mRNA MedicinemRNA technology brought speed to medical science which was not possible with conventional vaccine approaches. In simple words, this technology works by teaching and training the cells to be ready to fight when a specific enemy attacks the body. It is also short-lived and therefore, does not linger in the body as once it is used by the body’s cellular machine to do its job, it’s destroyed, easing concerns of it interacting with the host’s DNA. Pfizer and Moderna showed its power in easing the symptoms of COVID-19 virus, fueling our defense mechanisms. Moderna might have entered the spotlight thanks to COVID-19, but back in June, it reported encouraging results from its mid-stage trail evaluating its experimental mRNA-based vaccine it developed with Merck &amp; Co (NYSE: MRK) in an effort to combat the deadliest form of skin cancer. The study Moderna conducted found that when the vaccine is combined with an immunotherapy treatment from Merck, Keytruda, it reduced the risk of melanoma spreading by 65% compared to the immunotherapy alone. Earlier data showed that this combined Moderna and Merck treatment cut the risk of death or recurrence of melanoma by 44% compared to the immunotherapy, Keytruda, alone.With its latest study, Mainz Biomed showed the immense contribution of this technology to detect CRC that is the third most common cancer. Considering that it is the second most common cause of cancer-related disease across the globe, third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in the United States, this breakthrough in early prevention could save countless lives.Looking ahead, Pfizer is working on using mRNA technology to create a new approach to gene editing, possibly removing or correcting faulty genes in patients. As its mission, Moderna states that it is delivering on the promise of mRNA science to create a new generation of life-changing medicines. Therefore, the power of the mRNA promises to truly revolutionize medicine, improving health and lives across the globe.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

(PFE) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pfizer-inc-130011306.html,1695819611,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this drugmaker have returned -10.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share, indicating a change of -64.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 points to a change of -49.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.22 indicates a change of -3.3% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -33.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.47 billion and $66.16 billion estimates indicate -33.8% and -0.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $12.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -54.1%. EPS of $0.67 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.03%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis and recent news and developments in movie and news media, then head straight to the Top 5 Movie Studio and News Media Stocks. In the fast-changing media landscape, three major stories are making waves. Disney contemplates parting with ABC, Rupert Murdoch exits as chairman of Fox and News Corp, and a breakthrough may be in sight as studios make final offers to end a prolonged writers' strike. So, Why is Disney Selling ABC?Recent reports have indicated that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is in preliminary discussions to sell ABC to Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST), a media conglomerate with an extensive network of local TV stations and well-known networks such as CW and NewsNation. While these talks have garnered attention, it's worth noting that no formal steps have been taken in terms of hiring bankers or circulating sales documentation. Insiders familiar with the situation suggest that Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST) might face challenges meeting Disney's asking price for ABC.The idea of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) parting with ABC was initially floated by former CEO Bob Iger back in June. In an interview with CNBC, Iger hinted that traditional television assets, including ABC, may no longer be considered core to Disney's future strategy. This shift in perspective suggests that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is exploring new horizons and considering a more expansive approach to the television business. However, Iger also acknowledged the significant creative contributions that networks like ABC have made to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) over the years, leaving the door open to the possibility of a sale while emphasizing the value of the content and creativity that these networks have brought to the entertainment giant.Hollywood's Showdown: Inside the 2023 Writer's StrikeThe 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on May 2, 2023, stands as a significant disruption in American television and film production, similar to the setbacks witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the WGA's substantial labor strike in 2007-08. Story continuesRepresenting 11,500 screenwriters, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) is locked in an ongoing labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The strike's central issues revolve around the lack of agreement on a new contract, with writers advocating for improved compensation, enhanced funding and job security, larger writers' rooms, and limitations on the use of artificial intelligence in the writing process.The WGA's demands encompass AI regulations, adjusted pay structures to replace residuals, writers' room preservation, streaming pay standards, and job security. Notably, the Guild's proposals, as estimated by the WGA, could potentially cost studios $429 million annually, while studio counterproposals have been substantially lower, at $86 million.This strike has disrupted TV and film production, gaining support from Hollywood luminaries expressing backing for strike authorization on social media.High-level talks between studios and writers, involving key industry figures like Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s Bob Iger, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal film head Donna Langley, are ongoing. These negotiations come as media companies grapple with making streaming profitable and reviving theater attendance.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), in their securities filing in early September, adjusted their earnings expectations, anticipating a significant loss of $300 million to $500 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, with a full-year range of $10.5 billion to $11 billion, due to the strikes.Zaslav, at Goldman Sachs' Communacopia and Technology conference the next day on September 6, stressed the need to resolve the strikes swiftly, emphasizing the industry's commitment to a fair resolution. “We need to do everything we can to get people back to work,” Zaslav said at the investors’ conference. “We really have to focus as an industry, and we are, on trying to get this resolved in a way that’s really fair.”As of September 20, 2023, optimism surrounds the potential finalization of a deal by Thursday, though there's a warning that without an agreement, the strike could persist throughout the year, further affecting the industry and its stakeholders.Why is Rupert Murdoch Stepping Down?Rupert Murdoch, the iconic leader of News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA). and Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA), is stepping down as chairman to become chairman emeritus after a storied seven-decade career. His eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will assume the role of sole chairman at News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) and continue as Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA)'s executive and CEO. Rupert Murdoch's transition will take effect at the upcoming mid-November shareholder meetings. This move solidifies Lachlan's position as his father's successor, overseeing entities like the New York Post, Fox News, and Fox Entertainment.In a memo shared with CBS News, Murdoch emphasized that he's stepping back while in excellent health, while also stating that it's the opportune moment for him to embrace new roles.Armed with recent headlines about media and news companies, it's valuable to have insights into the stocks of movie studios and news media companies.Without further ado, let's move to the list of top movie studio and news media stocks.Movie Studio and News Media Stocks ListOur Methodology To create our list of movie studio and news media stocks, we initially gathered the largest movie studio and news media stocks listed on U.S. exchanges, focusing on their market capitalization (as of the writing of this piece) as the ranking metric of our list.

The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock appears to be significantly undervalued based on the GuruFocus Value calculation.

Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. PayPal Holdings has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $28.60 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.57.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, PayPal Holdings's return on invested capital is 16.66, and its cost of capital is 12.28.Unveiling PayPal Holdings (PYPL)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PayPal HoldingsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by President Daniel Schulman for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$76.17 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$58.93. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Daniel Schulman.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

IBM also confirmed that the standard contractual intellectual property protections for IBM products will apply to IBM-developed watsonx AI models. IBM's Granite models apply generative AI to the modalities of language and code.IBM Corporation logo.Recognizing that a single model will not fit the unique needs of every business use case, the Granite models are being developed in different sizes. These IBM models — built on a decoder-only architecture — aim to help businesses scale AI. For instance, businesses can use them to apply retrieval augmented generation for searching enterprise knowledge bases to generate tailored responses to customer inquiries; use summarization to condense long-form content — like contracts or call transcripts — into short descriptions; and deploy insight extraction and classification to determine factors like customer sentiment.With these models and watsonx, IBM enables businesses to be AI value creators. Businesses can bring their proprietary data to IBM base models and build a model that is unique to their business and use cases.IBM has heavily invested for years in developing its foundation models. They are custom-built for the specific requirements of business use cases, which by definition are much more focused than consumer AI and demand the highest levels of precision and accuracy. IBM's internal benchmarking shows that specialized models can deliver better accuracy, and do so with lower infrastructure requirements, to achieve improved price-performance.Story continuesIn addition to its own models, IBM provides flexibility to use third-party models like Meta's Llama 2-chat 70 billion parameter model and models from the Hugging Face community.IBM Publishes Information about its Training Methodology for Granite ModelsThese IBM-developed foundation models have been trained on business-relevant datasets from five domains – internet, academic, code, legal and finance – and have been curated for business use by IBM. Training data was filtered for objectionable content and benchmarked against internal and external models to help enable responsible deployment and address key issues including governance, risk assessment, privacy concerns and bias mitigation. As part of this process, IBM is using its end-to-end AI and data model lifecycle governance process and capabilities to manage and help mitigate client risk with the watsonx AI and data platform. This includes the planned release of watsonx.governance, an AI governance toolkit to enable trusted AI workflows. Watsonx.governance will be generally available later this year.IBM Contractual Protections for AI ModelsIBM believes in the creation, deployment and utilization of AI models that advance business innovation responsibly. That is why the company is also announcing its standard intellectual property protection — similar to what it provides for hardware and software products — will apply for IBM-developed watsonx models.IBM provides an IP indemnity (contractual protection) for its foundation models, enabling its clients to be more confident AI creators by using their data, which is the source of competitive advantage in generative AI. Clients can develop AI applications using their own data along with the client protections, accuracy and trust afforded by IBM foundation models.""When it comes to today's AI innovation boom, the businesses that are positioned for success are the ones outfitted with AI technologies that demonstrate success at scale and have built-in guardrails and practices that enable their responsible use,"" said Dinesh Nirmal, Senior Vice President, Products, IBM Software. ""Today's release of IBM's Granite model series and commitment to stand behind IBM-developed watsonx models is a testament to IBM's end-to-end model lifecycle management process in its watsonx AI and data platform that delivers businesses cutting-edge AI outfitted for their unique business needs.""For more than a century, IBM has worked to earn the trust of business and society by ushering powerful new technologies, including AI, into the world responsibly and with clear purpose. To date, the company has built and made available a range of open source tools and AI governance software to help ground the creation and use of this technology in principles of transparency, explainability, privacy, robustness and fairness.To learn more about the IBM Granite model series, now available on watsonx, visit here.Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice and represent goals and objectives only.About IBMIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

A challenging macroeconomic landscape with rising inflation is also a concern. Soaring prices and persistent delays in customer acceptance have resulted in high levels of backlog and cast a pall on the industry’s prospects. Nonetheless, International Business Machines IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE, NCR Corporation NCR and Agilysys AGYS are a few industry participants to watch as they are benefiting from the rise in advanced forms of data management, the rapid shift from traditional silos, increased demand for integration of deployment techniques as well as modern application development.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry comprises companies that provide advanced information technology solutions, including computer systems, software, storage systems and microelectronics. These industry players are increasing investments in data modernization and analytics, cyber defense, remote work, automation and contact-less services, customer &amp; employee experience and supply-chain modernization, which accelerate growth in digital transformation services. Some industry participants also provide technological solutions (both products and services) to help organizations connect, interact and transact with customers. Others develop and market information recognition, data entry software, systems and technologies.4 Computer - Integrated Systems Industry Trends in FocusIntegrated Solutions Driving Demand: The industry is benefiting from rising demand for integrated solutions across small, medium and large-scale enterprises as well as increasing investments in IoT, big data, AI and blockchain software technologies. Moreover, business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and security and social businesses present significant opportunities to an increasing number of remote workers in the wake of the coronavirus-induced work-from-home wave. The industry players are anticipated to benefit from recovering global IT spending, as predicted by Gartner.Story continuesSolid Adoption of Multi-Cloud Model: The growing adoption of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is expanding the scope of industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Supply-Chain Bottlenecks and Backlogs: Industry participants are witnessing supply constraints, softness in server demand and cognitive applications, as well as delays in customer acceptance. These are resulting in consistent backlog levels, particularly in Compute, High Performance Computing &amp; Mass Storage Class and Storage. Moreover, volatility in foreign exchange — primarily due to the current macroeconomic scenario and headwinds in emerging markets — does not bode well for the industry.Semiconductor Chip Shortage Mars Prospects: Industry participants are facing challenges stemming from the ongoing and time-consuming business model transition to the cloud. Further, lower spending across Data-Center Systems — primarily due to component shortages like memory and CPUs, as well as deceleration in hyperscale spending — is likely to dampen the prospects of industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #167, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Sep 30, 2022, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2023 has moved down 14.1%.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching based on a strong earnings outlook.

The group was able to experience firsthand and even contribute to work at the facility. They also learned soft skills to apply to their future careers.""This was definitely a great experience,"" said Celeste Salazar, 22, studying Mechanical Engineering at Michigan State. ""This was more hands on than some other companies offer.""The participants spent the summer learning about the different departments at the refinery, covering refining 101, tech services, safety, maintenance, engineering and operations. Under supervision, they learned how to change the oil on the refinery vehicles, how to weld pipes, and how engineers plan out their projects. They learned the meaning of hazard symbols and how the fire department members are specifically trained to respond to different emergencies.""It makes me feel really good to know that we are helping invest in these young people who are from Detroit in a very real and impactful way.""""We worked together as a group on a project converting 9,000 files into an archive system for easy searching,"" said Javonte Jackson, 18, Grand Valley State University.

""They were impressed with the focus on safety that we have here at Marathon. They heard it in every session.

""During Engineering Week, Kathy in Document Controls was dropping life knowledge on us. She was sharing how to handle actual situations in life. How to act in the workplace. It was meaningful on a personal level.""During the final week of the program, the Mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan visited the students during a session at the Kemeny Recreation Center near the refinery. The students shared what they worked on during the summer and gave the mayor some ideas to continue making improvements in their neighborhoods and the city overall.""The ideas were flowing,"" said Corporate Social Responsibility Representative BreAnna Lockhart, who oversees the program at the refinery.

These students have grown so much over the summer, and I look forward to seeing what they achieve after graduation.""GDYT is a citywide summer jobs program in Detroit that trains and employs young adults ages 14-24, though participants at the refinery are age 18 and over.

Biden backed their call for a 40% pay raise and improved working conditions.In response to Trump's speech, the Biden campaign called the former president a ""billionaire charlatan"" who didn't care about the working class but instead pursued pro-business policies that moved jobs overseas during his time in office.""Donald Trump is lying about President Biden's agenda to distract from his failed track record of trickle-down tax cuts, closed factories, and jobs outsourced to China,"" Biden's campaign said in a statement while Trump spoke.Story continuesThe decision by both Trump and Biden to insert themselves into the historic auto strike highlights the importance both men place on securing support from working-class voters in Michigan and other battleground states in next year's presidential race.Trump, who appears on track to clinch the Republican Party nomination and challenge Biden for the presidency, lost Michigan in 2020 by some 154,000 votes. It is one of three Rust Belt states, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that Trump picked up in 2016 but lost in 2020, and the three will likely prove critical to both parties next year.Jason Roe, a Republican strategist based in Michigan, said Trump was successfully tapping into angst among working class voters who feel they are falling behind economically, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation.""That’s what he's exploiting. That’s what he exploited in 2016,"" Roe said.U.S. automakers have complained that the Biden administration's rules promoting electric vehicles risk burdening them with excessive costs, but there is no evidence to suggest they are headed towards bankruptcy as Trump suggested.Spurred on by incentives, automakers are sinking tens of billions of dollars into new domestic factories to meet demand for electrified vehicle sales, which captured 8.9% of the U.S. market during the first half of 2023 and continue to grow.During Trump's 2017-2021 White House term, his administration generally sided with businesses over the interests of workers on policy matters, though some of his trade policies were aimed in part at protecting domestic manufacturing jobs.The UAW has to date not backed either presidential candidate, making it the only major union not to endorse Biden. The UAW leadership has welcomed Biden's support, however, and spoken about Trump and his record in scathing terms.Promising to end the government's EV push if elected, Trump urged the UAW to back him in the presidential race.""I don't care what you get in the next two weeks or three weeks or five weeks,"" he said. ""They're going to be closing up and they're going to be building those cars in China and other places. It's a hit job in Michigan and on Detroit.""

Investors are left wondering how long Big Three automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA) can hold out.Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst — Global Autos, sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what the profit margin squeeze could look like if the strike continues.""There is some degree of political theater here, right? Both sides that don't really want to cave in,"" Narayan says. ""UAW coming in with a very unprecedented high demand — 40% increase in labor costs — and then the OEMs they have a situation they're facing which is coming off really high price mix that's probably going to start normalizing. So that is going to pressure their profitability, they definitely don't want to pay higher wages on top of that.""Narayan also reacts to Tesla (TESLA) CEO Elon Musk's beliefs that the UAW strike could ultimately bankrupt the Big Three operators.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: I think a lot of people are struggling to understand the dynamics at play here. A lot of fingers being pointed at EVs and some of the incentives being given to that industry. In your mind, how much is that-- of that is sort of the culprit for the squeezed margins of the automakers, which maybe then are leading them to this negotiation with the workers? How are you thinking about this?TOM NARAYAN: Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of this. We have to put everything in context. There is some degree of political theater here, right? You have both sides that don't really want to cave in. UAW coming in with a very unprecedented high demand, right, 40% increase in labor costs. And then the OEMs, they have a situation they're facing, which is coming off really high price mix that's probably going to start normal rising. So that is going to pressure their profitability. They definitely don't want to pay higher.Story continuesWages on top of that, they have given in to as much as 20% wage increase. The UAW wants a lot more. So it's definitely a hot topic. I'm sure it's getting a lot of attention. I do think, ultimately, a resolution will happen, just like it did in 2019. You're getting-- we're in the midst of it, right? It's only been two weeks. So there's going to be a lot of discussion in the media and the press about it. But ultimately, we do think it'll get resolved.JOSH LIPTON: And Tom, as you noted, this is getting a lot of attention, including getting the attention of Elon Musk. And he warned that the UAW demands, Tom, could drive Ford, GM, Stellantis to bankruptcy. I'm sure you saw this. He posted on next. They want a 40% pay raise, a 32-hour workweek, sure, fire away, he says, to drive GM, Ford, and Chrysler bankrupt in the fast lane. Let me get your response to that, Tom. Is Musk right?TOM NARAYAN: No, I think that's some-- I don't know for another way to say it, but that's a lot of Elon speak, I think. It's definitely not positive, right, for the auto industry to have 30% or 40% or whatever wage increases. But we were actually run the math on this, thanks to Ford that provided some data.You know, labor costs is actually only about 3 percentage of sales. So if wages or labor costs increased by 20%, it would only be about a 70 basis point hit to operating income. If it's a 30% increase, which we think might ultimately be what happens, it's only about 100 basis point margin impact. So if you're an 8% margin company, it drops to about 7%.So these companies are not going to go out of business by any means. They have really rich balance sheets. They went through the pandemic and made a lot of money. They don't want to pay more, but they can survive this. So I think this is on--JULIE HYMAN: Tom, we want some-- we want some drama. We need the sky to be falling. Come on. Yeah. You know, I'm also curious, since some of this is performative, some of it is politics, not just on the part of Elon Musk or actual politicians, but on the part of the union, on the part of the people running the automakers. You know, what if-- a lot has been made, not just of what the workers make, but what executives make also. I mean, what if Mary Barra comes out tomorrow and says, fine, I'll take a 25% pay cut, she's still, obviously, would be making a lot of money. I mean, is there any chance in hell that something like that could happen?TOM NARAYAN: No. I don't think so. And I think people realize, right? I mean, all of our pay is based on a free market, right? I mean, the reason why she makes what she makes is because that's what she's worth, right? You can put a CEO in-- a wrong CEO in that job, and it could lose a lot of people's jobs, right?So ultimately, I mean, look how much money Elon Musk has made for Tesla, right? If I can say something positive about him, right, it's $800 billion worth, right? So him alone is worth them not needing to advertise, because he tweets and that creates marketing value for the company, right? So like a CEO is worth a lot at the end of the day. I think this is, yeah, it comes into the political theater debate. I mean, ultimately, you know, she's worth every penny that her shareholders think that she's worth.]"

Former President Donald Trump will be visiting a non-union parts center in Michigan on Wednesday, September 27.Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian, Dan Howley, and Josh Schafer discuss the latest news on the UAW strikes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Let's talk about some trending stories today. Big news here with the UAW. Yahoo Finance has confirmed with the UAW that they will expand their strikes tomorrow, the stand-up strikes, if there's no major progress made with the big three. So we're seeing the UAW again going to do that. This is the second expansion potentially after last Friday when they went to 38 parts distribution centers just for GM and Stellantis, not Ford, because they felt Ford had made some progress with them in their talks.This comes as Trump now, guys, is going to visit Michigan after Biden. But he's going to a non-union parts center called Drake Enterprises. Of course, this being Trump. But there will be supposedly some autoworkers there. A lot going on in Michigan right now. A lot going on in the world of automakers. And I'm not sure what you guys think about this, but I think this is sort of like, we keep hitting more and more new sort of terrain here for this whole battle.JOSH SCHAFER: I mean, it seems like the UAW is certainly living up to what they said they would do, right? They said consistently, basically, no matter where-- it seems like no matter where the negotiations go, as long as they don't sign a new contract, come that next Friday, come the next deadline, they're going to ratchet it up another notch, because they have made progress with Ford. So you were wondering, OK, you've started to make some progress, do you not want to then extend the strike, hurt the autoworkers more or the auto companies more?Story continuesBut it seems like, they don't care. They're like, no, we're on a process here. No matter where the contract negotiations are at, even if we're very close to signing, we're going to follow the schedule, which I think seems to maybe be working at this point. It's hard to-- it's hard to tell, because we're not in the negotiation room, of course.DAN HOWLEY: It's interesting seeing the kind of political movement now, you know, with Trump going to a non-union shop, but also talking to union workers?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: They said, current union workers and some non-current workers, so some maybe some ex-workers. It's just going to be at a park center. Who knows who's going to be there? It could include some UAW, guys. It could not. But that's what they're sort of saying. And he's going to go there to address autoworkers. Who knows who's going to be there.DAN HOWLEY: But then we also have Biden there on the line.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: On the line.DAN HOWLEY: On the picket line, right?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: He went to a GM center-- part center, yep.DAN HOWLEY: So now, is it that they are props at this point, where, you know, there's this-- you know, the workers are trying to get better rates or more-- less work, less hours or fewer hours. And now, you have presidential candidates just showing up and being, like, hey, what's up guys, you want to hang out?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well I will say it was a pretty powerful scene yesterday to see the President of United States go to a picket line. It was, like, maybe a few dozen workers there. And they were sort of just, wow, the president's here supporting us. And he said you guys have kind of done a lot for the country, you guys deserve more.So it's a big sort of chip in the pot for the UAW. Also, really want to add that tomorrow or Friday, you know, they could not strike at Ford, or they could ratchet it up at Ford and maybe back off GM or Atlantis if they feel they're making progress. So we'll see what happens. It's a very interesting chess game they're doing. But, you know?JOSH SCHAFER: And a political chess game, too, as you said. If one person from one party goes, the other party is going to feel like they have to go, right? And that's probably something we're going to start seeing business-wide, industry-wide, as we sort of heat up in a political season.]"

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the autonomous vehicle industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy Now.According to Allied Market Research, the size of the autonomous vehicle industry is set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% between 2021 and 2030. At the end of 2020, the size of the autonomous vehicle and trucking industry was valued at $76.13 billion. It is anticipated to reach $2.16 trillion by the end of this decade. The global autonomous vehicle market can be broken down into six sub-categories, namely application, automation, component, propulsion type, region, and vehicle type. According to a report released by leading management consulting firm McKinsey in January 2023, autonomous driving has the potential to contribute $300 billion to $400 billion to the top line of companies involved in this industry by 2035. Within this estimate, around $170 billion to $230 billion is expected to be contributed by Level 4 automation, which refers to a high level of automation where the vehicle can drive itself under certain conditions, but a human driver must be able to take over when the system requests. The driver does not need to constantly monitor the driving environment. The analysts at McKinsey believe that the hardware and software cost of Level 3 and Level 4 automation could be as high as $5,000 per vehicle. McKinsey anticipates that 12% of new passenger cars sold by 2030 will have at least Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities. Meanwhile, the adoption of advanced autonomous driving technologies is expected to reduce the number of accidents by 15% in Europe by 2030.Transforming the Trucking Industry with Autonomous TechnologyInvesting in the best autonomous driving stocks requires a long-term view. Numerous self-driving car companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have introduced autonomous vehicles across various cities in the US and across the world. Investors who opt for an early buy-in into this theme could see a significant upside down the line. The introduction of autonomous technology into the trucking industry holds significant importance due to its critical role in various industries' supply chains. It’s worth noting that trucks are involved in over 500,000 accidents annually, equivalent to 9.5% of total accidents in the US. Truck drivers have a 10 times higher probability of death on the job as compared to an average American. According to the CEO of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based autonomous technology provider Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR), Chris Urmson, 29 of the 30 incidents that took place between Dallas and Houston could have been avoided if Aurora Driver had operated the truck instead of a human. This reflects the high level of safety guaranteed by autonomous driving technologies. The company is working on introducing completely autonomous driving trucks without the presence of a human by the end of 2024. This could play a pivotal role in overcoming the shortage of long-haul truck drivers in the US, which currently stands at 80,000 and is anticipated to double by 2030. Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR) is considered among the best under-the-radar autonomous vehicle stocks.

Experts believe that the Silicon Valley state already has the toughest regulations for autonomous vehicles in the US. The state has only allowed light-duty trucks on its public roads, and companies must undergo numerous tests before deploying any new automobile-related technology on the roads. Meanwhile, China is also amongst the countries at the forefront of promoting autonomous driving technology. In Beijing, the world's first fully connected cloud-controlled autonomous driving demonstration zone has been established. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a leading name in the autonomous driving industry in China through its Apollo Go division. During the first quarter of 2023, approximately 42%  of new passenger vehicles sold in China were equipped with varying levels of autonomous driving assistance features. China boasts a vast network of over 20,000 kilometers (km) of roads available for autonomous vehicle testing. With this context in mind, let's take a look at our autonomous driving companies' rankings.12 Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy NowRasica/Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyWe have shortlisted the 12 best autonomous driving stocks to buy using Insider Monkey's database of 910 elite hedge funds. Each of the companies listed below provides exposure to either one or multiple sub-categories of the autonomous trucking and vehicle industry. We have ranked the best autonomous driving stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2023.Best Autonomous Trucking and Vehicle Stocks To Buy Now12. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $1,759,298,500Market Capitalization: $46.62 billionBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based artificial intelligence (AI) and internet company. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has taken a major initiative to advance autonomous vehicles through its Apollo program. The company has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in China since 2018 using its Apollo open self-driving platform. Its test fleet has logged over 60 million kilometers of autonomous driving. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) recently expanded its fleet of driverless taxis in Wuhan to 300.Here's what Ariel Investments said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“By comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China’s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company’s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”11. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $404,462,190Market Capitalization: $3.84 billionLyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a San Francisco, California-based ride-hailing service provider and a competitor of Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the North American region. The company claims to have provided 100,000 rides in autonomous vehicles. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is developing self-driving car technology through its Level 5 division. Level 5 aims to build ridesharing vehicles that can operate safely without human drivers. The company is at the eleventh position on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The sale of rideshare provider Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), similar to our moves in communication services, prunes a smaller position to consolidate the portfolio in our highest conviction ideas. We initially purchased Lyft in May 2021 when rideshare volumes were still depressed due to COVID-19. While Lyft was a clear #2 behind Uber in domestic rideshare, we believed it was a cleaner way to play the U.S. recovery due to the focused nature of its business. However, poor execution and the uneven nature of the U.S. recovery, with West Coast markets where Lyft has historically had greater exposure lagging due to a lack of return to office work, further weakened its market position. In March, Lyft announced co-founder Logan Green would step down as CEO with David Risher, a former Amazon executive, taking his place. While Risher has laid out ambitions to drive Lyft’s market share higher, we believe doing so will require more than a few quarters fix. Furthermore, while the company has looked for areas to right size their cost base, we see necessary investments in price, service levels and product differentiation to drive this turnaround further pushing out the path to improved profitability.”10. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $895,505,810Market Capitalization: $49.75 billionFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) has established a dedicated subsidiary known as Latitude AI solely focused on the development of autonomous driving technology. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker intends to bring together experts in the field of machine learning, operations, sensors, software, and systems engineering together for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has recorded over 50 million miles of hands-free driving through its Active Driving Assistance System, Ford BlueCruise.9. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $1,823,077,500Market Capitalization: $27.69 billionAptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is a Troy, Michigan-based automotive technology company focused on advanced safety, connectivity, and self-driving solutions for major automakers. The company has the distinction of rolling out autonomous ride-hailing services on a commercial level in the city of Las Vegas. As of 2023, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) has provided over 100,000 self-driving rides to the general public and claims it has received 100% ratings from 98% of the customers.Here's what Artisan Partners said about one of the best autonomous driving stocks in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Along with Catalent, we ended our investment campaigns in Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) and Nasdaq during the quarter. Aptiv is a leading provider of safety, infotainment and electronic control components to the automotive market. Our view was that the company was well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular industry trends—the shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, autonomous driving and increased computing intensity in vehicles. Over our holding period, a volatile macro environment (pandemic, supply chain shortages) steadily weighed on the profit cycle despite the company’s strong new business announcements. Furthermore, we believe the company may be increasingly disadvantaged as leading auto manufacturers work around tier-one suppliers (such as Aptiv) to maximize profits and speed to market. While the profit cycle may ultimately take hold, we concluded that several of our semiconductor holdings (ON Semiconductor, Lattice Semiconductor and Monolithic Power Systems) offer stronger leverage to these important new auto trends and decided to exit the position.”8. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $2,513,405,900Market Capitalization: $44.82 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is betting heavily on autonomous vehicles as it anticipates generating annual revenue of $50 billion through its Cruise autonomous vehicle division by 2030. To achieve this goal, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has expanded the presence of Cruise to cities in Arizona and Texas. Of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database at the end of Q2 2023, 72 funds reported owning a stake in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).7. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $2,303,052,600Market Capitalization: $120.17 billionQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a San Diego, California-based chipmaker that is targeting the autonomous vehicle industry through the Snapdragon Ride platform. The platform integrates multiple critical components for self-driving, including cameras, radars, LIDAR processing, CUDA cores for neural network AI, functional safety capabilities, and autonomous driving software. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) claims that Snapdragon Ride delivers over 700 trillion operations per second to run deep learning-based perception and planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has secured the seventh position on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy now.6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $6,517,644,300Market Capitalization: $777.25 billionTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) gains exposure to the autonomous driving industry through its Full Self Driving (FSD) software.

FSD is Tesla's advanced driver assistance system that uses onboard cameras, sensors, and neural net processing power to enable autonomous driving features in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. The platform’s capabilities include auto lane changing, automated parking, stopping at traffic lights and stop signs, and highway autopilot features.Here's what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:Many factors contributed to the strong performance of our largest Disruptive Growth position, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), in the period. Investors’ concerns regarding Tesla in 2022 continue to dissipate, and the company’s business has continued to grow materially, although at below peak margins. Tesla’s deliveries in China are recovering. The company’s newest factory in Texas has ramped production and should contribute to improved domestic sales and margins. U.S. government policies have lowered the cost to own Tesla vehicles, while also reducing the company’s battery production expenses.We continue to believe that Tesla is only scratching the surface of its potential. We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers. EV adoption is at a tipping point. And Tesla, with its approximately 60% domestic market share of EVs, should be the most important beneficiary of this shift…”  (Click here to read the full text)In addition to Tesla, Inc.

I think you're in the same kind of situation now.The auto workers have never been of a single mind when it comes to politics. There's always been division, and there is a sizable conservative or populist wing in the auto worker membership, and Trump appealed to that in 2016, perhaps somewhat less so in 2020, but he's here to broaden that appeal, and he's going to appeal directly over Sean Fein's head.He has no interest in talking to Sean Fein. He wants to talk to the membership, and he knows that there are a lot of people that work in the auto industry that are employed by non-union employers, and he's concerned about the exodus of jobs and the fact that America is behind in the electric vehicle manufacturing game, so to speak, and that if we don't do something to catch up quickly, we're going to lose the industry.]"

The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.Story continuesAccording to our valuation method, McCormick (NYSE:MKC) appears to be modestly undervalued. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance.

405,94eebb38-2558-3fbf-b828-fe4bd824fb37,MKC,2023-09-28,Earnings Preview: McCormick (MKC) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-mccormick-mkc-q3-140002583.html,1695736802,STORY,['MKC-V'],"[The market expects McCormick (MKC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 3, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.69 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick?For McCormick, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.02%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McCormick will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of $0.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.60, delivering a surprise of +5.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McCormick doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

United expects to launch these new tools early next year.""By offering customers an easy way to know if their personal wheelchair fits on a particular airplane, we can give them the peace of mind they deserve when they fly with us,"" said Linda Jojo, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer for United. ""Plus, collecting this information ahead of time ensures our team can handle these special items with proper care and attention.""New Flight Filter and Fare ReimbursementThe new flight filter on united.com will enable customers to enter the unique dimensions of their personal wheelchair as part of the flight search. The search results will then prioritize flight options on aircraft with cargo hold doors large enough to accommodate the wheelchair dimensions. The size of aircraft cargo hold doors varies, so some aircraft are better able than others to handle larger motorized wheelchairs, which must travel upright. If a customer is unable to take a preferred flight because their wheelchair will not fit through the aircraft's cargo door – and takes a United flight with a higher-fare that can accommodate their wheelchair on the same day and between the same origin and destination – the customer may seek a refund of the fare difference. Customers seeking a refund of the fare difference will need to follow United's process, including completing a short form after they've traveled. United will promptly ensure they receive the difference in fare after review.Story continuesAirport Experience Improvement ProgramLater this year United will begin a six-month pilot program at George Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport to explore ways to better accommodate customers in the unlikely event their wheelchair was damaged or delayed while traveling. The program will focus on the timeframe between a customer's arrival and when United returns the wheelchair or provides an appropriate loaner wheelchair if the original is damaged. United will collaborate with its Accessible Travel Advisory Board to explore several initiatives aimed at improving the airport experience during this challenging period, including providing specialized seating onsite and reimbursing the customer for transportation expenses should they choose to wait at a location other than the airport.United entered an agreement earlier this month with the U.S. Department of Transportation to deliver these initiatives through a mutual commitment to increase accessibility and improve the travel experience for customers who require the use of a wheelchair. United carried about 150,000 wheelchairs in 2022.United's other recent measures to improve accessibility include:Providing ramp agents new mobile technology that indicates when a wheelchair is on a flight to ensure they are prepared to receive and load it. The technology also inhibits ramp agents from closing out a flight until they acknowledge that they've loaded all wheelchairs.In August, United became the first U.S. airline to add Braille to aircraft interiors, helping millions of travelers with visual disabilities more easily navigate the cabin independently. United expects to outfit its entire mainline fleet with Braille by the end of 2026.The United mobile app was recently redesigned to make it easier to use for people with visual disabilities with increased color contrast, more space between graphics and reordering how information is displayed and announced to better integrate with the screen reader technologies like VoiceOver and TalkBack.United's latest Inflight Seatback Entertainment screens offer a wide range of accessible features such as closed captioning, text-to-speech controls, magnification, explore-by-touch capabilities, audio-described movies, and adjustable and high-contrast text and color correction. As part of United Next, the airline's historic growth plan, the carrier expects to take delivery of about 700 new narrow and widebody aircraft by the end of 2032, all of which will include the latest in seatback screen entertainment options.Through Bridge, United's Business Resource Group for people of all abilities, employees help create a workplace environment where all can strive to achieve their maximum potential and support our commitment to being an ally for customers with disabilities.For the eighth-straight year, United was recognized as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion and earned a top score on the Disability Equality Index benchmarking tool, a joint initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities and Disability:IN, to advance the inclusion of people with disabilities.About UnitedAt United, Good Leads The WaySM.

408,42333d7e-ca5d-39d9-a745-18232e56fd13,UAL,2023-09-28,Government shutdown could impact airlines' efficiency: Expert,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/government-shutdown-could-impact-airlines-155634615.html,1695743794,VIDEO,"['LUV', 'UAL', 'AAL', 'ULCC', 'ALK', 'SAVE', 'JBLU']","[The looming threat of a government shutdown could carry significant challenges for the travel industry, potentially resulting in daily losses nearing $140 million. The aviation sector is anticipated to be the hardest hit, with the possibility of essential workers being required to work without pay.Yahoo Finance Live is joined by Boyd Group International President Mike Boyd to discuss the implications for consumer travel and the challenges that may arise for the Federal Aviation Administration.""Overall, it's just going to accelerate a decline in the efficiency of our air transportation system... also issues of oversight of airlines, oversight of airports, oversight of manufacturers and components,"" Boyd says. ""That's where the real sand might get into the works.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: A government shutdown would have dramatic implications for the US travel economy, with some estimates putting the hit at around $140 billion a day. The aviation sector is a key focus. While many essential staff like air traffic controllers are expected to report for duty without pay, workers calling in sick could be an issue yet again.We want to bring in Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. And, Mike, lay this out for us because estimates are all over the place and exactly what a government shutdown-- the impact that is going to have on the travel industry. What's your view?MIKE BOYD: Well, I think initially, air travel will be just as inconvenient as ever. We have understaffed air traffic control systems right now and the employees know they're going to get paid eventually. The real issue is long term.And it's not just things like training. [? Buddha Air ?] brought that up. That really won't come into play. What really will come into play is the day-to-day regulation that the FAA has over airports, airlines, and also aircraft manufacturers, where Boeing won't be able to get that inspector to take a look at that new system they want approved on an airport. And Eastern Wyoming won't be able to get an FAA inspector to come and look at the New runway. Over a period of time that could have a hit.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Would this also impact some infrastructure projects, especially, given the environmental reviews permitting that would be disrupted and some of these infrastructure projects taking place in or around or at airports?MIKE BOYD: It would. In the near term it certainly wouldn't have much of an effect because it's only going to be several days probably. But nevertheless, in terms of hurting the environment, that's not going to be the case. I don't think, per se. It'll just-- you shut down the whole air transportation system, that's a lot less jet fuel going into the air.But nevertheless, the bottom line of the whole thing is the FAA is in a situation right now where it needs to get reorganized and revisited. We've got new electric airplanes coming along line that are really heading for a brick wall regulation wise. We really can't take these people off of those jobs because thats critically important. You and I don't see that. But in five years-- in five weeks, five months, we probably will.SEANA SMITH: Mike, what about the traveler's behavior? Do we typically see people maybe canceling their trips if we see a government shutdown?MIKE BOYD: I think people that don't really look into it, probably would assume, yes, if the government shuts down, my airplane might shut down. Let's not go see grandma right now. There'll be some of that. But I think overall at least if this doesn't last more than a couple of-- more than a week or so, we're not going to see a whole lot of anything.I don't see a walkout. I don't see people calling in sick. These controllers and TSA people, they know they're going to get paid. It's just going to be a little late paycheck and there might be something after accelated when it comes.BRAD SMITH: Certainly, and that was the case back in 2019, where we did see absenteeism on the rise, especially, after that two week period because of delayed paychecks. Now, what kind of impact would that mean for the airline operators should we get to that point?MIKE BOYD: Well, right now, today, our air traffic control system has been a wonderfully bipartisan, mismanaged thing over the last 20 years. So I don't think we're going to see anything missing right now. But overall, it's just going to accelerate a decline in the efficiency of our air transportation system, mainly because of the ATC system. But also issues of oversight of airlines, oversight of airports, oversight of manufacturers and components, that that's where the real sand might get into the works.BRAD SMITH: And, so, as you were mentioning earlier, it also impacts the safety checks therein. So what type of resumption would we be talking about thereafter?MIKE BOYD: Well, I don't think we'll see anything with safety. Look, the airline industry today, they know that safety is really expensive. So you're not going to have that problem. But getting back on, we bring up a real good point.When you shut something down, getting it back. Getting that FAA inspector back to take a look at that new system that a component manufacturer is putting together might take weeks. So it'll delay a lot of things and will hurt some companies. There's no question about it because it won't be able to produce the systems they want to produce or develop them, that sort of thing.It could be again-- that's where you got these billions of dollars and millions of dollars a hit-- it's not people getting on the airplane at gate seven at LaGuardia.BRAD SMITH: All right, Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. Mike, always a pleasure to get some of your insights and analysis around this. We'll hope that we don't get to that point. But you may be getting another call from us.MIKE BOYD: I'd love to. Thank you, sir.]"

""Ubuhle Women: Beadwork and the Art of Independence"" highlighted a contemporary form of bead art, the ndwango (translates as ""cloth"" or ""rag""), created by the women in South Africa's rural KwaZulu community.Founder and curator Beverly Gibson and artist Ntombephi ""Induna"" Ntobela established Ubuhle, which means ""beauty"" in South Africa's Xhosa and Zulu languages, in 1999 for women to learn the community tradition of beadwork using Czech glass. In the rural, mountainous community of KwaZula-Natal province, cattle-raising and corn and sugar crops drive the local economy, and women often are denied opportunities to earn a steady income or obtain a Western education.1Ubuhle Beads opened an opportunity for the Xhosa and Zulu women to sell the pieces to establish some financial freedom.Jarrod Ingle, regional president and head of corporate banking for PNC's Orange County-Inland Empire market, says sponsorship of the traveling Ubuhle exhibit brings visibility to the importance of moving all forward financially.""The exhibition is representative of women's ingenuity and the inequity they face around the world and here in our own community,"" Ingle says. ""Our team is dedicated to supporting the achievement of women financial decision-makers across the region and will remain diligent in our work to help close the economic gender gap.""Story continuesProgress, But Much Work NeededThe bank's PNC-Certified Women's Business Advocates (WBAs) have been providing resources to women financial decision-makers for nearly two decades. In 2021, on Sept. 14, the 257th day of the year, PNC launched Project 257®, inspired by the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Gender Gap Report, which declared that it would take 257 years for women to catch up to men economically. The recently released 2023 report shows improvement: 169 years to reach economic parity at the current rate of progress.1""It's a hopeful sign that nearly a century's worth of progress toward economic equality can be achieved in just a few short years, but 169 years is still too long to wait,"" says Beth Marcello, director of Women's Business Development at PNC. ""The new data gives me confidence that closing the gap is within the realm of possibility if everyone works together to increase women's representation in the workforce, income equality and access to credit.""Across the country, the bank continues to look for opportunities to support women. A coast-to-coast network of 5,000 men and women PNC-Certified WBAs are dedicated to supporting the financial success of women, including those who own or lead businesses. Dozens of those WBAs serve the Orange County-Inland Empire market.The bank makes further impact through partnerships that align with PNC's values and commitment to supporting women, including relationships with the global nonprofit Coralus, which provides 0% interest loans, mentorship and support to women entrepreneurs, and Women Presidents Organization, which provides a peer network to women presidents across the globe. Another example is PNC's annual Women in Business Week, which offers motivating experiences and insights on a variety of topics relevant to women financial decision-makers.PNC's support for accelerating women's financial equality also shows up through its role as The Official Women's Business Champion for the Angel City Football Club in Los Angeles and the enterprise-wide Women in Motorsports partnership with Chip Ganassi Racing, an internship program that engages a selected group of women college students in on-site learning and career-development experiences in the traditionally male-dominated sport of auto racing.Moving All Forward in Orange County-Inland EmpireTo help launch the Ubuhle exhibit last month, local PNC WBAs presented a panel discussion on women and finance that included Ubuhle curator Gibson along with community leaders Mary Cramer, member of Bowers board of governors, and Debora Wondercheck, founder and chief executive officer of the Costa Mesa-based Arts and Learning Conservatory. Gibson led a tour of the exhibit following the discussion.Raquel Bone, managing director for Institutional Asset Management in Southern California, moderated the conversation that touched on everything from establishing the early foundations of financial wellness to the responsibilities of managing childcare while building a successful business or career.""These kinds of conversations can help lift the veil to reveal the barriers to financial success that women often face,"" Bone says, ""and they also serve as a great source of inspiration that can guide women to the many resources in our community that can help accelerate financial equality.""https://www.britannica.com/place/KwaZulu-Natalhttps://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2023/digestThese articles are for general information purposes only and are not intended to provide legal, tax, accounting or financial advice.

The closing of the stores, which will be effective on Oct 21, includes three stores in Portland, OR, three in the San Francisco Bay Area, two in Seattle and one in New York City.The company invests significantly in boosting the safety and security of its workers and customers by adding more security workers, hiring third-party guard services and installing theft-deterrent tools such as locking up merchandise. It also provides training to store operators and security team members to de-escalate any potential safety issues.Despite the retailer’s efforts to improve loss prevention measures, instances of theft and retail crimes soared by 120% in the first five months of the year compared with the year-ago period. This led the company to anticipate an additional theft-related loss of $500 million in the current fiscal year compared with the last fiscal year. The company came up with the decision to close stores due to the above-mentioned challenges.Target noted that it will still operate more than 150 stores in the markets where the store closures will take place.  The company will offer its affected store workers the option to relocate to other locations.TGT highlighted that it will continue making strong investments in order to prevent theft and organized retail crime incidents, thereby securing the safety of its workers and customers. These include making payroll investments in additional security forces, using theft-deterrent tools and providing training to store workers.The company will also invest in cyber defense and collaborate with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations division to prevent retail theft and fraud. It will work on developing custom tools for detecting criminal activity and integrating them into in-store and online processes.Target highlighted that it will cooperate with industry participants and participate in the National Store Walk Month initiative to combat the issues of organized retail crime and theft.It will collaborate with the national and local retail industry associations, including RILA and the National Retail Federation to fund advocacy and educational initiatives.Story continuesWhat’s MoreTarget continues to emphasize developing flexible-format stores to penetrate deeper into urban and suburban areas. It opened 23 new stores and completed 140 full-store remodels in fiscal 2022. It plans to open about 20 new stores in a variety of sizes in fiscal 2023. The firm is also investing in approximately 175 of its existing stores, ranging from full remodels to the addition of Ulta Beauty at Target or Apple at Target shop-in-shop experiences or expanded capacity for same-day fulfillment services.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have declined by 17.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 3.7%.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks are Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, Boot Barn BOOT and Brilliant Earth Group, Inc.

418,ae27756c-acd2-3066-a112-7c3ddac53b2a,TGT,2023-09-28,What Costco's earnings are saying about the retail sector,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/costcos-earnings-saying-retail-sector-140944283.html,1695823784,VIDEO,"['WMT', 'COST', 'TGT']","[Costco (COST) topped earnings and revenue estimates as other retailers are reporting weakness across the sector. Forrester Research Retail Analyst Sucharita Kodali joins Yahoo Finance Live to react to Costco's fourth-quarter earnings report and how it compares to the consumer narratives playing out in the larger retail space.""Costco's business does tend to be fairly recession-proof, similar to other mass merchants like Walmart, in large part because when a consumer may have lower expectations for the future, they're going to fly to value,"" Kodali says. ""Costco absolutely offers that.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Let's start with Costco results because they had strong grocery sales but weaker trends in some of those discretionary items. What does this tell us just about the state of the consumer at this point heading into that very important holiday season?SUCHARITA KODALI: Yeah, well, I mean, it's a pretty consistent story through all of retail. You have the groceries doing particularly well, in large part because these are the items that-- Food, in general, food, both at home and away from home, has done incredibly well in the last couple of years. It's been one of the beneficiaries in spite of waning consumer confidence and inflation numbers, so that's not surprising.The discretionary piece is also not surprising. It's the same story that we heard with Target. Walmart said the same thing in its last earnings call. And you see it in the overall consumer spend numbers that the census releases on a monthly basis, which is categories ranging from apparel to electronics, which are absolutely categories that Costco carries which just haven't done as well.Home, as well, is one that's particularly soft in the last year and-- and Costco, as far as discretionary is concerned, has historically sold a lot of things like firepits and patio furniture. So there's no doubt that those are categories that are challenged, and you're not seeing the strength, even at Costco, in those sectors.Story continues- The expectations index, as we kind of look at some of the Conference Board data that had come out, showed that consumer short-term outlook for income, business, labor markets, it declined, and expectations falling below 80, a level that historically signals a recession in the next year. If we were to see that, how would that dovetail into the number of consumers that are either signing up as members in Costco or leaning into some of the broader, kind of buying-in-bulk patterns of spending?SUCHARITA KODALI: Yeah, what is important about Costco's business is that it does tend to be fairly recession-proof, similar to other mass merchants like Walmart, in large part because when a consumer may have lower expectations for the future, they're going to fly to value, and Costco absolutely offers that. We've known that, historically, most-- their profit, for the most part, their net income is their-- is very correlated to their membership fees. They're not really making that much money off of the sale of the physical goods themselves, and that very much is about passing value onto shoppers. It is very much about providing the best value and the best product assortment that you can for the consumer.I mean, Costco has been incredibly well-managed as a company pretty much since its inception. I mean, 10 years ago, it was a $100-billion retailer. Now it's $200 billion.I know that its stock today may be taking a mild hit. But when you also step back and look at its performance over time, its stock price is at nearly its high. Its highest was, I think, last spring in 2022. It's comping that, and it is very comparable to the overall NASDAQ index. So it's actually-- overall, when you step back and look at the macro, and you look back at the bigger picture, it's actually doing very, very well. It's held up in spite of some of these issues related to consumer confidence and the fact that people are pulling back from discretionary.]"

I'm so excited to be here. Three things you need to know to get your business and investing day started right, and I'm so excited about these three things I'm actually reading off my phone here today. Normally I don't do that-- I just go off the cuff-- but my phone it is.First up, Goldman Sachs saying 90% chance of a government shutdown that lasts two to three weeks. They think it could trim almost 2/10 of a percent of growth each week that the government is shut down. How do I read that? That probably wouldn't be good for markets and government workers who need that paycheck to live week to week, so that's the first thing.Number two, Costco and Target. Target first up really-- I encourage you to look at this story written by our very own Brooke DiPalma. Target saying closing nine stores in this country because of rising retail crime. They have been warning about this all year long, but to hear of Target closing nine stores because of rising retail crime, wow. Mind-blowing.And then Costco on its earnings call last night saying they did not see a dramatic increase in theft, which makes sense. It's hard to walk out of a Costco carrying 30-- a 30-pound container of mustard and mayonnaise, so I get it. But they are likely seeing some increase in retail theft, which is very interesting.Next thing, three, Marriott out this morning reaffirming its outlook for growth that they put out there in August. That is good to hear from Marriott. Anthony Capuano, CEO of that company, leading the charge, but good to hear considering we just saw a weak consumer confidence report. It looks like people are still putting on their bathing suits and going vacation. And then bonus-- here's a forth thing because I just live that type of life-- Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong exclusive interview today on Yahoo Finance with our all-star Fed reporter Jen Schonberger. Tune in. Watch it, share it, everything. Brian Sozzi out.]"
420,d61db3c8-5efc-3e62-93ee-8a24bbfe6333,TGT,2023-09-28,Dell Technologies and OneWater Marine have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-technologies-onewater-marine-highlighted-115000658.html,1695815400,STORY,"['DELL', 'ONEW', 'M', '^GSPC', 'TGT']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 27, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Dell Technologies DELL as the Bull of the Day and OneWater Marine ONEW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Target TGT, Macy's M and Amazon AMZN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Dell Technologies stock is showing considerable relative strength in a weak market environment and is further bolstered by a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Dell Technologies is a provider of information technology solutions including servers, storage, and networking products as well as commercial and consumer notebooks, desktop computers and workstations.In addition to a rebound in PC sales, which seem to have bounced off a bottom, its growth in server sales is being accelerated by the explosion in Artificial Intelligence opportunities. 20% of server orders YTD were AI enabled.DELL continues to adjust to the technology market's needs and with a reasonable valuation, and strong price momentum is a worthy investment consideration for any investor's portfolio.Earnings Estimates Snap HigherAt the most recent quarterly earnings report Dell Technologies beat analysts estimates by a whopping 54% and marked its sixth consecutive upward earnings surprise. These strong results have prompted analysts to make some significant revisions higher to future earnings expectations, as can be seen in the chart below.Current quarterly earnings estimates have been revised higher by 8.1% and FY23 earnings estimates have increased by 13.5% over the last two months. EPS are forecast to climb 12% annually over the next 3-5 years.Strong Stock in a Weak TapeSince the last Federal Reserve interest rate meeting on September 20, stocks have been reeling, as Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated that he would continue to keep interest rates higher for longer. And while the S&amp;P 500 is down nearly -6% month to date, Dell Technologies shows immense relative strength.Story continuesFurthermore, the price action in DELL stock has been forming a compelling technical chart pattern. The stock has been building out this bull flag consolidation over the last two weeks and if the price can breakout and close above the $70 level, it should make a bull run.Critical to DELL moving higher in the short term will be how the broad market acts. However, even if there is some market weakness that pulls down DELL stock in the very short term it remains a convincing investment over the medium and long term.Reasonable ValuationEven with double digit earnings growth estimates, and a strong position in its respective market, Dell Technologies trades at a very reasonable valuation. Today, it is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 13.1x, which is well below the industry average of 34.5x, and above its three-year median of 10.3x.DELL also pays a generous dividend yield of 2.1% and raised the payout by 12% over the last year.Bottom LineDell Technologies, with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), demonstrates resilience and adaptability in a volatile market, making it a noteworthy investment consideration. The company's innovation in AI-enabled server sales and its rebound in PC sales highlight its potential for sustained growth. Despite broader market uncertainties, its reasonable valuation, strong price momentum, and substantial dividend yield enhance its appeal, making Dell a promising investment for the discerning investor.Bear of the Day:OneWater Marine, a premium boat retailer, is trading in a steep down trend, punctuated by dismal guidance from management, falling earnings estimates, and compressing margins. These developments have led analysts to revise earnings estimates lower, giving OneWater Marine a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating.Falling Earnings EstimatesEarnings estimates have been revised considerably lower over the last two months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been lowered by -73% and are projected to fall -66% YoY to $0.43 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised lower by -37% and are forecast to decline -50% YoY to $4.58 per share.Highlighting a bright spot for the boat retailer is that sales growth is expected to remain marginally positive this year and next, which is better than some of its competitors expect. Nonetheless, the industry is expected to see headwinds going forward.Bearish Technical PatternAfter gapping down more than -30% following the bleak Q3 earnings report, ONEW stock has remained under pressure. The price action isn't encouraging as a bearish wedge has formed in the chart, and a breakdown on Tuesday indicates there may be further downside action ahead.ValuationOneWater Marine is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 5.4x, which is in line with its historical median, and well below the industry average of 24.8x.Bottom LineThe leisure and recreation industry currently sits in the bottom 3% (237 out of 245) of the Zacks Industry Rank, showing a broad weakness in the segment. After the incredible boom period following the Covid-19 pandemic, it seems a lot of consumer spending, especially big-ticket items like boats was pulled forward a couple years. However, there will be a time in the future where demand for ONEW products again picks up, and the stock will again be worth considering. But until those earnings estimates begin to trend higher, I would avoid the stock.Additional content:Retailers Ramp Up Staffing Ahead of Holiday SeasonWith the holiday season approaching, retailers are actively preparing to meet the high expectations of shoppers eager for exciting deals. Players in the industry are all geared up to walk the extra mile this festive season to capitalize on any potential upswing in demand. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending, exhibiting remarkable resilience despite a challenging economic environment.Strategies to Meet Consumer PreferencesThe holiday season holds significant importance for retailers as it contributes a substantial portion of their annual revenues. Consequently, retailers must proactively address logistical and inventory challenges while devising comprehensive strategies to deliver a seamless shopping experience, both in physical stores and online. Keeping all these aspects in mind and to keep pace with any unprecedented increase in demand, retailers are unveiling hiring plans for the holiday season.To cater to consumers' product preferences, retailers are focusing on replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization. These efforts are expected to result in the recruitment of a considerable number of seasonal associates who will play crucial roles in managing curbside and in-store pickups of online orders as well as doorstep deliveries. Furthermore, retailers are likely to expand their warehouse staff to ensure a smooth flow of inventory from distribution centers to stores throughout the festive season.Retailers' Hiring InitiativesTarget is set to appoint nearly 100,000 seasonal workers, aiming to provide a seamless shopping experience for its customers. The company is launching its holiday deals early, featuring thousands of new items priced under $25 across various categories.Target Circle members will enjoy exclusive access to the ""Deal of the Day"" shopping event, both in the store and online. From Oct 1 through Dec 24, customers can avail of incredible offers, including discounts on renowned national brands such as Apple, Nespresso, Dyson and Nintendo, along with an additional 5% discount with the RedCard.Keeping in mind the festive rush, Macy's plans to fill more than 38,000 full and part-time seasonal associates across its Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury stores, along with its distribution centers. The company is committed to offering competitive wages, with many positions starting at a minimum of $15 per hour.Macy's is on track to strengthen its omnichannel capabilities with investments in online shopping experiences, data and analytics, technology infrastructure as well as better fulfillment capabilities.Meanwhile, Amazon has ambitious plans to deploy 250,000 associates for the crucial festive season. The e-commerce giant aims to recruit individuals for both part-time and full-time positions, including roles in fulfillment centers and transportation, across the entire nation.Final ThoughtsThe significance of the holiday season for retailers cannot be overstated. This period marks a crucial juncture, often accounting for a substantial portion of annual sales. The influx of enthusiastic shoppers provides retailers with the opportunity to showcase their offerings, boost revenues and solidify brand loyalty. Retailers leverage this period to not only maximize sales but also leave an indelible impression on consumers.However, market analysts are skeptical about whether the upcoming holiday season will meet retailers' expectations. They believe that cautious consumer spending, influenced by diminishing household savings and ongoing economic uncertainties, could potentially hinder the season's performance. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 3.7% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period spanning from Nov 1 to Dec 24.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Walmart's stronger sales growth has been reassuring to investors with many retailers dealing with other headwinds such as shrink.Walmart’s e-commerce presence has also continued to expand through its online delivery and in-store pickup. While Target's online sales dropped -10% during Q2, Walmart’s jumped 24% with the company still deriving much of its sales from groceries and not having to rely on other non-essential products like many of its omnichannel competitors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDell's Technology Solutions are in the AI MixMany tech stocks have dwindled lower in September including Dell Technologies' artificial intelligence partner Nvidia NVDA.However, DELL is only -4% from its 52-week highs at around $69 a share. Investors look eager to buy the dip for Dell’s enticing generative AI proponents that have been embedded in many of its hardware products (workstations) and technology solutions.With Dell’s stock up +74% for the year it may still be a more affordable option for AI exposure than Nvidia. The trend of rising earnings estimate revisions is very compelling as well which is indicative of more short-term upside especially as broader markets stabilize.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNew Relic Keeps Expanding The road to profitability and expansion for software analytics company New Relic has gained steam as its offerings are also being harvested by AI.Founded in 2008 and public since 2014, New Relic is expecting expansive double-digit percentage growth on its top and bottom lines with NEWR soaring +52% YTD and on the cusp of its 52-week highs of $86 a share back in May.Those late to the party may certainly be waiting for a pullback as New Relic’s AI for IT operations (AIOps) is expected to catapult the company among the Internet-Software realm.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line With the broader indexes starting to curtail as of late these stocks look like prime buy-the-dip candidates as they continue to flirt with the possibility of higher highs.

This project was unveiled during Huntsman's 2021 Investor Day event and is now taking shape. Once completed, this plant will stand as one of the most extensive facilities in the Americas. It signifies a substantial stride in advancing the commercialization of MIRALON technology and marks a significant step closer to establishing a large-scale production facility.MIRALON structural carbon products are advanced materials based on carbon nanotubes. They can be produced in various forms, including sheets, tape, yarn, or as additives and dispersions. Remarkably, these materials are thinner than human hair and possess a strength up to 25 times greater than that of steel. They are also lightweight and exhibit excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. These attributes make MIRALON carbon nanotube materials suitable for various applications across industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction and more. Some applications include electric vehicle batteries, high-performance composites, engineered thermoplastics, conductive adhesives, specialized concrete and longer-lasting tires.Significantly, the manufacturing process yields clean hydrogen with minimal to no CO2 emissions, holding great promise within the global energy transition landscape. It can potentially lower the carbon footprint associated with various industries. The carbon footprint linked to this manufacturing process can be up to 95% less compared with the traditional steam methane reforming (SMR) process, effectively mitigating most CO2 emissions typically associated with hydrogen production. Furthermore, the potential to establish small MIRALON manufacturing units on customer sites opens up the possibility of on-site hydrogen production, further reducing carbon emissions and potentially qualifying for CO2 sequestration/capture credits.The new plant is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2023, in line with the commitments made during the 2021 Investor Day. In the interim, Huntsman's technical and commercial teams are actively collaborating with customers interested in harnessing the innovative capabilities of MIRALON materials to develop groundbreaking solutions.Story continuesShares of Huntsman have lost 1.5% in the past year against a 10.9% rise of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, in its second-quarter call, noted that it sees stable demand for the Advanced Materials unit in the third quarter, with some modest volume decline due to typical seasonality.

The company has been trading in Dublin for over 80 years. CRH had completed the necessary changes to transfer its primary listing from Euronext Dublin to NYSE. The company's shares were 2% higher in early trading in New York today.The decision to shift its primary listing to New York was made earlier this year, with a secondary listing in London also chosen. CRH will still maintain its headquarters and tax residency in Ireland. The move was approved by CRH shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) in June.Albert Manifold, CEO of CRH, said that the move would allow the company to leverage large US government spending programs and future tax advantages in mergers and acquisitions. This could facilitate a ""higher vector of growth"". He noted that being recognized as an American company would put them on a level playing field with their competitors in a very competitive market.Last year, the US market accounted for about 75% of CRH's core earnings, making it the largest building materials supplier in the country. In 2022, CRH reported group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.4bn and revenues of $32.7bn.Notably, billionaire investors George Soros and Seth Klarman established positions in CRH during the summer. Over two dozen hedge funds disclosed new or increased positions in CRH’s American Deposit Receipts on Nasdaq recently.Following CRH's departure from Euronext Dublin, Flutter Entertainment, owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, became the largest Irish company listed on the exchange. Flutter is also considering moving its primary listing to New York later this year or early in 2024, following a majority of its investors backing the plan. However, Flutter has not yet confirmed this move.Additionally, paper and packaging giant Smurfit Kappa is planning to merge with US-based WestRock (NYSE:WRK). If the deal proceeds, it will also delist from Dublin and be listed on the NYSE. The merged entity, Smurfit WestRock, would be a $20 billion paper and packaging giant, still headquartered in Ireland.Story continuesThe departure of CRH and the potential exits of other companies have raised concerns for Euronext Dublin, which has seen several A-listers leave in recent years. However, Siobhan Talbot, CEO of Glanbia, reassured that the group has no intention of leaving its Dublin listing for the US.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

AAN has opened its latest GenNext store in Fort Smith, AK. This move will help expand the company's GenNext store initiative and offer better in-store customer experience. Store timings are from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.The GenNext initiative was originally launched in 2018 and has received positive customer feedback since then. The initiative includes new and remodeled stores. To date, Aaron's has converted or opened 32 GenNext stores, bringing the total to 243.These stores come with re-engineered store layouts, updated signage, expanded product assortment, enhanced technology-enabled checkout and an innovative operating model.What’s More?This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been gaining from cost-reduction initiatives and a solid online show. It continued to witness strength in its e-commerce platform. In second-quarter 2023, e-commerce lease revenues rose 5.5%, accounting for 17.9% of the total lease revenues. The uptick can be attributable to increased website traffic and a higher conversion rate.Some other notable efforts include increased investments in digital marketing, improved shopping experience, same-day and next-day delivery services, the personalization of products, and a broader assortment, including the latest product categories. Its express delivery program also bodes well.The company’s latest acquisition of appliance and electronics retailer, BrandsMart, enabled AAN to offer high-quality furniture, appliances, electronics, and other home goods on affordable lease and retail purchase options to its customers. In second-quarter 2022, Aaron’s included BrandsMart revenues for the first time since its buyout.For the BrandsMart segment, revenues were $143.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, driven by strength in small appliances and housewares, and e-commerce. The company is optimistic about the segment’s performance in the near term. The buyout is likely to strengthen Aaron’s market position and help expand the customer base.However, weak lease revenues and fees, and drab retail sales at both Aaron's and BrandsMart businesses are headwinds. This led to a consolidated revenue decline of 13.1% in the second quarter.Also, continued inflationary and other economic pressures affecting customers' payment activity act as deterrents. Both segments are expected to continue experiencing softness in customer demand in its core product categories, including appliances, furniture and electronics, in the second half of the year.Consequently, management anticipates 2023 revenues of $2.12-$2.22 billion compared with the earlier stated $2.15-$2.25 billion. The lowered revenue outlook is mainly due to lower early purchased options and drab retail sales at the Aaron's business in the second quarter, which is likely to continue throughout the year.For 2023, adjusted EBITDA (excluding stock-based compensation) is likely to be $140-$160 million. The company expects earnings per share of 55-80 cents compared with the earlier stated 70-95 cents. For the BrandsMart business, revenues are anticipated to be $615-$645 million, lower than the $645-$675 million stated previously.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research As a result, AAN shares fell 25.9% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 9%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean RCL and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(NASDAQ:ADI). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$200 and falling to the lows of US$172. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Analog Devices' current trading price of US$173 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Analog Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices What's The Opportunity In Analog Devices?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 8.39% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Analog Devices today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $159.44, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Analog Devices’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Analog Devices?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Analog Devices' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ADI’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with SBA Communications should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.4. These indicators suggest that SBA Communications, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Unpacking the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesIntroducing SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC)SBA Communications owns and operates almost 40,000 cell towers throughout North America, South America, and Africa. It leases space on its towers to wireless service providers, who install equipment on the towers to support their wireless networks. The company has a very concentrated customer base, with most revenue in each market being generated by just the top few mobile carriers. The company owns more than 17,000 towers in the U.S., which accounted for about three fourths of the company's total revenue in 2022. Internationally, SBA's greatest presence is in Brazil, where it operates roughly 10,000 towers. SBA operates as a real estate investment trust, or REIT.Is SBA Communications (SBAC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDissecting SBA Communications's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of SBA Communications's Altman Z-score reveals SBA Communications's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating SBA Communications's historical data, 2021: -0.68; 2022: -0.75; 2023: -0.69, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates SBA Communications's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap?Considering the low Altman Z-Score and declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio, SBA Communications may be a potential value trap.

(NYSE:V), a world leader in digital payments, spotlighted the evolution of its dispute program, making it easier for merchants to fight first-party misuse, also known as friendly fraud or first-party fraud, for card-not-present transactions. This change could save small businesses over a billion dollars in losses globally over the next five years, in turn benefitting the entire ecosystem of consumers and merchants.The rule change gives merchants more ways to show a disputed charge is valid and authorized, helping business owners keep money that is rightfully theirs, while protecting legitimate cardholder activity.The impact of first-party fraud can be devastating for small businesses. ""This rule change is going to be a gamechanger for my business,"" said Kaseedee Pilarz, owner of PilatesBKLYN, a duo of fitness studios in Brooklyn, NY. ""I have been in tough situations where legitimate membership charges have been disputed. If I lose the dispute, not only do I lose the membership fee, I also get a penalty. That can be the difference between making payroll or not. This change will help ensure I have a fair shot during those disputes.""""The change we’ve made to our dispute process is an important part of our strategy for fighting all types of fraud on the Visa network,"" said Paul Fabara, Chief Risk Officer, Visa. ""The dramatic rise in first-party fraud rates necessitated this change.

The scene deteriorated further last week, with the Federal Reserve keeping its policy interest rates unchanged in the 5.25%-5.5% range in its September FOMC.While the Fed's decision should have otherwise come as a major boost for the cryptocurrency market, investors' sentiments were dampened. Investors' concerns grew following the post-FOMC statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who stated that another quarter percentage point interest rate hike is required this year as inflation remains stubbornly high.Powell also lowered the forecast for interest rate cuts from four to two in 2024, which is likely to not start before September. This means higher interest rates are going to stay for a longer period than expected earlier.Also, a 25-basis point hike, which is expected in the Fed's November FOMC, will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, much higher than the earlier forecast of 5.1%.The hawkish stance of the Fed saw treasury yields soar to multi-year highs. The yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note hit 5.441% on Sep 22, its highest level since 2006. This link is closely linked to the possibility of a near-term economic downturn.Moreover, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield reached 4.494%, hitting its highest level since 2007.Higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency.

High inflation, monetary tightening, the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and slowing demand from key trading partners is contributing to the economic slowdown. However, 2024 will witness the nation's economic growth strengthen significantly, reaching 2.6%, driven primarily by the resurgence of private consumption and investment, as well as increased public expenditure.As such, Poland is a dynamic destination for businesses and expatriates. July 2022 saw the Polish government adopting the “Productivity Strategy 2030,” aimed at creating a digitized industry, increasing technological use, and developing an algorithmic data-based economy. Efforts to expand the economy include supporting high-tech investments, supporting scientific research, entrepreneurship, and innovation, as well as increasing productivity and foreign trade. To enable this, the country welcomes foreign investment to enjoy unrestricted access to the Polish market as a source of its growth, capital, jobs, and also a vehicle for transferring technology and integration into global supply chains.Currently, more than 1500 American companies operate in the country.

With this new investment, across our sites in Warsaw we will have capacity for 2500 employees, with potential for future growth,""Magdalena Kotlarczy, Country Director, Poland.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), subsidiary of Google has launched a Cloud region, the first of such an investment in Poland and Central and Eastern Europe. Similarly, April 2023 saw Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) opening its newest trusted cloud region, the first in Central and Eastern Europe, in the country too.“Microsoft’s investment in Poland will accelerate our country’s transformation into a technology hub for the Central and Eastern European region, thanks to the development of the Polish Digital Valley, hundreds of engineers and developers will be able to play a key role in the global economy without leaving the country. This is responsible development.”Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.Poland is also set to serve as the ideal location for Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)'s first strategic Tech and Product Hub. Visa Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, Block Inc. SQ, Visa Inc. V and PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Crypto Stocks to Watch as Volatility LoomsOn Sep 21, the cryptocurrency market suffered a setback courtesy of the Fed. In its September FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5%, as stated on Sep 20. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dampened market participants' sentiments.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two maximum rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.As a result, the yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note reached 5.202%, its highest level since 2006. This link is closely linked to the possibility of a near-term economic downturn. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4.494%, its highest level since 2007.A higher market interest rate is detrimental to high-growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency. Notably, the crypto space suffered a huge blow last year as the Fed pursued a rigorous interest rate hike regime.Story continuesConsequently, on Sep 21, prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) slid 1.7%, 1.9%, 1.9%, 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Stocks in FocusRobinhood Markets Inc. operates a financial services platform in the United States.

I'm so excited to be here. Three things you need to know to get your business and investing day started right, and I'm so excited about these three things I'm actually reading off my phone here today. Normally I don't do that-- I just go off the cuff-- but my phone it is.First up, Goldman Sachs saying 90% chance of a government shutdown that lasts two to three weeks. They think it could trim almost 2/10 of a percent of growth each week that the government is shut down. How do I read that? That probably wouldn't be good for markets and government workers who need that paycheck to live week to week, so that's the first thing.Number two, Costco and Target. Target first up really-- I encourage you to look at this story written by our very own Brooke DiPalma. Target saying closing nine stores in this country because of rising retail crime. They have been warning about this all year long, but to hear of Target closing nine stores because of rising retail crime, wow. Mind-blowing.And then Costco on its earnings call last night saying they did not see a dramatic increase in theft, which makes sense. It's hard to walk out of a Costco carrying 30-- a 30-pound container of mustard and mayonnaise, so I get it. But they are likely seeing some increase in retail theft, which is very interesting.Next thing, three, Marriott out this morning reaffirming its outlook for growth that they put out there in August. That is good to hear from Marriott. Anthony Capuano, CEO of that company, leading the charge, but good to hear considering we just saw a weak consumer confidence report. It looks like people are still putting on their bathing suits and going vacation. And then bonus-- here's a forth thing because I just live that type of life-- Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong exclusive interview today on Yahoo Finance with our all-star Fed reporter Jen Schonberger. Tune in. Watch it, share it, everything. Brian Sozzi out.]"

Marriott will outline its plan to add 230,000 to 270,000 net rooms over three years, expanding its industry-leading global portfolio to nearly 1.8 million rooms by year-end 2025.  This represents a three-year CAGR for net rooms of 5.0 to 5.5 percent.  In addition, the company's model assumes global RevPAR growth at a two-year CAGR of 3 to 6 percent from 2023 to 2025, after rising 12 to 14 percent this year.""With global travel poised for continued robust growth, our strategy is to deliver the best brands and experiences for consumers, to attract and retain the most loyal guests and to be in more places around the world.

""As consumers continue to prioritize travel and experiences, we are focused on transforming our technology platform while leveraging our powerful revenue engines and our leading Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program to connect people through the power of travel.  With our extraordinary associates around the world, I am incredibly optimistic about Marriott's future.""Given the assumptions in its three-year model, the company could produce the following results:Total gross fee revenues could rise 16 to 18 percent year-over-year in 2023 and at a 6.5 to 9.5 percent two-year CAGR to reach $5.4 to $5.8 billion in 2025.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) could increase 18 to 21 percent year-over-year in 2023 and at a 7 to 10 percent two-year CAGR to reach $5.2 to $5.7 billion in 2025.Adjusted diluted earnings per share (adjusted diluted EPS) could rise 25 to 29 percent year-over-year in 2023 and at a 10 to 15 percent two-year CAGR to reach $10.10 to $11.45 in 2025.Shareholders could see $1.9 to $2.0 billion in dividends, assuming a 25 percent payout ratio, and $9.8 to $11.6 billion in share repurchases, for total shareholder returns of $11.7 to $13.6 billion over the three-year period through 2025.Story continues""Our asset-light and resilient business model drives powerful results,"" said Leeny Oberg, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Development. ""We expect to produce significant free cash flow and earnings growth over the next few years and create meaningful value for our shareholders.""Growth AreasAs part of the presentation of its three-year financial model, Marriott will discuss the priority it is placing on generating valuable global rooms growth over the long term. The company will discuss its efforts to grow the distribution of its more than 30 leading brands, while also introducing new brands and offerings that meet customers' evolving needs.  It will highlight the following key priorities that support its growth plans – midscale, extended stay, leisure and luxury, and conversions.The company expects to follow a tailored development approach in its expansion in the affordable midscale segment, recognizing differences by continent to accommodate regional customer and owner expectations.  To date, Marriott has completed an acquisition (the City Express brand portfolio) in the Caribbean and Latin America region, created a midscale extended stay brand in the U.S. &amp; Canada region (StudioRes) and, just this morning, announced a new brand for its Europe, Middle East and Africa region (Four Points Express by Sheraton).  The company also plans to further expand in the extended stay segment, having recently announced the launch of Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy.Marriott is also emphasizing luxury and leisure offerings.  It is currently leading in luxury distribution globally, with nearly 500 open luxury hotels and 17 percent of the market, approximately 1.5 times the size of its next largest competitor.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis and recent news and developments in movie and news media, then head straight to the Top 5 Movie Studio and News Media Stocks. In the fast-changing media landscape, three major stories are making waves. Disney contemplates parting with ABC, Rupert Murdoch exits as chairman of Fox and News Corp, and a breakthrough may be in sight as studios make final offers to end a prolonged writers' strike. So, Why is Disney Selling ABC?Recent reports have indicated that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is in preliminary discussions to sell ABC to Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST), a media conglomerate with an extensive network of local TV stations and well-known networks such as CW and NewsNation. While these talks have garnered attention, it's worth noting that no formal steps have been taken in terms of hiring bankers or circulating sales documentation. Insiders familiar with the situation suggest that Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST) might face challenges meeting Disney's asking price for ABC.The idea of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) parting with ABC was initially floated by former CEO Bob Iger back in June. In an interview with CNBC, Iger hinted that traditional television assets, including ABC, may no longer be considered core to Disney's future strategy. This shift in perspective suggests that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is exploring new horizons and considering a more expansive approach to the television business. However, Iger also acknowledged the significant creative contributions that networks like ABC have made to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) over the years, leaving the door open to the possibility of a sale while emphasizing the value of the content and creativity that these networks have brought to the entertainment giant.Hollywood's Showdown: Inside the 2023 Writer's StrikeThe 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on May 2, 2023, stands as a significant disruption in American television and film production, similar to the setbacks witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the WGA's substantial labor strike in 2007-08. Story continuesRepresenting 11,500 screenwriters, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) is locked in an ongoing labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The strike's central issues revolve around the lack of agreement on a new contract, with writers advocating for improved compensation, enhanced funding and job security, larger writers' rooms, and limitations on the use of artificial intelligence in the writing process.The WGA's demands encompass AI regulations, adjusted pay structures to replace residuals, writers' room preservation, streaming pay standards, and job security. Notably, the Guild's proposals, as estimated by the WGA, could potentially cost studios $429 million annually, while studio counterproposals have been substantially lower, at $86 million.This strike has disrupted TV and film production, gaining support from Hollywood luminaries expressing backing for strike authorization on social media.High-level talks between studios and writers, involving key industry figures like Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s Bob Iger, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal film head Donna Langley, are ongoing. These negotiations come as media companies grapple with making streaming profitable and reviving theater attendance.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), in their securities filing in early September, adjusted their earnings expectations, anticipating a significant loss of $300 million to $500 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, with a full-year range of $10.5 billion to $11 billion, due to the strikes.Zaslav, at Goldman Sachs' Communacopia and Technology conference the next day on September 6, stressed the need to resolve the strikes swiftly, emphasizing the industry's commitment to a fair resolution. “We need to do everything we can to get people back to work,” Zaslav said at the investors’ conference. “We really have to focus as an industry, and we are, on trying to get this resolved in a way that’s really fair.”As of September 20, 2023, optimism surrounds the potential finalization of a deal by Thursday, though there's a warning that without an agreement, the strike could persist throughout the year, further affecting the industry and its stakeholders.Why is Rupert Murdoch Stepping Down?Rupert Murdoch, the iconic leader of News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA). and Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA), is stepping down as chairman to become chairman emeritus after a storied seven-decade career. His eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will assume the role of sole chairman at News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) and continue as Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA)'s executive and CEO. Rupert Murdoch's transition will take effect at the upcoming mid-November shareholder meetings. This move solidifies Lachlan's position as his father's successor, overseeing entities like the New York Post, Fox News, and Fox Entertainment.In a memo shared with CBS News, Murdoch emphasized that he's stepping back while in excellent health, while also stating that it's the opportune moment for him to embrace new roles.Armed with recent headlines about media and news companies, it's valuable to have insights into the stocks of movie studios and news media companies.Without further ado, let's move to the list of top movie studio and news media stocks.Movie Studio and News Media Stocks ListOur Methodology To create our list of movie studio and news media stocks, we initially gathered the largest movie studio and news media stocks listed on U.S. exchanges, focusing on their market capitalization (as of the writing of this piece) as the ranking metric of our list.

This customized solution enables firms hitherto crippled with coverage gaps, lost connectivity, fractured security, data congestion and inconsistent service quality to have a dedicated capacity with adequate bandwidth to minimize costly downtime and missed opportunities.With about 68% of Verizon customers possessing 5G-capable smartphones, there is an increasing propensity to consume more 5G traffic, consequently freeing up capacity on the 4G network.

In the enterprise and wholesale business, it is changing its revenue mix toward newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services.The company has further expanded Fios Forward to support digital inclusion and provide opportunities for underserved households to thrive in the digital world.

This evaluation helps Vestberg decide whether to work from home or engage with his employees to ensure he can maximize his productivity and be at his best.Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer, Pras Subramanian, and Rick Newman break down Vestberg's mood-tracking practice and examine how it could relate to them.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Do you rate your guys mood, by the way, daily every day?RICK NEWMAN: It's usually bad.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Usually bad. I'm less than a five today, I think, but our former employer or boss, Hans Vestberg of Verizon said at the Fast Company Innovation Festival, that every day since the year 2009 he's rated himself on a 1 to 10 scale as to whether he's happy or not or high energy. If he's a 1, 2, 3, meaning low energy or unhappy, he says that he should work from home or avoid other co-workers, because he's not in a good head space, as you see there.3 to 7 is his, I'm energized, best productive self. He can work with employees, be a good-- be a good boss. And then the extreme end, which is really funny to me, too much energy, he wears people-- literally says, he would wear people out, because he's too energetic and asking too much of them.Hans, I got to credit you, man. That's very reflective, very self-aware of himself. But maybe every day since 2009 is a bit too much. What do you guys think?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.RICK NEWMAN: Well, I mean, so I think-- I'm a 1 or 2 every day. If that's an excuse to avoid my co-workers--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: We have these--RICK NEWMAN: No offense to anybody personally. But if one or two, I mean, I'm a two every day. I'm like, sorry, I need to avoid you guys. I'm a 2 today. I got to stay home.JOSH SCHAFER: I like being fake happy. You know, I think when you walk into the office, you kind of just perform a little bit and you put a big smile on for everyone. You bring some--Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You're a young guy.JOSH SCHAFER: Because I just think that's how--RICK NEWMAN: You're so naive.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

I go into the subway, hour-long--RICK NEWMAN: Now, you're a 2.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I was a 3, 2, 2, 3. I should be Hans and go home. Go to my office, my office and shut the door. But, yeah, I mean, should I be here today? I don't know? What do you think, Rick?RICK NEWMAN: I-- just gave you the way out, man. I mean, if you're a 2, you don't want-- you shouldn't be around. You might be a danger to your coworkers. I mean, you don't to bring the rest of us--JOSH SCHAFER: I do think it does kind of make sense, though, like, not necessarily always stay home, but just like when you're in some kind of mood or something, everyone does that. You put-- you just kind of go alone, right? You put your headphones on. And you're like, I probably shouldn't talk to people right now.RICK NEWMAN: We're only missing one thing here. The boss can rate himself or herself, but the other people should also be able to rate the boss on a daily basis and say, you're a 2 today, go home.]"

While this massive undertaking is not over, the results have been unmistakable, with customers using the network in more places in more ways and having a better experience on the Verizon network.“It’s been a tremendously dynamic and exciting few years for our network, introducing 5G to the market, redesigning the network core functions, accelerating our fiber build and introducing a host of advanced technologies to improve our customers’ experience with us,” said Joe Russo, EVP and CEO of Global Network and Technology. “These changes mean more people can do more things in more places more reliably, and that’s what we’re all about as a company.”A massive, multi-year network transformationMajor upgrades to Verizon’s network over the past few years include:Introducing 5G service to more than 230 million people, accelerating C-band spectrum deployment and strategically using premium mmWave spectrum to serve customers in high 5G usage areas.Expanding 5G Fixed Wireless Access Internet availability to cover more than 40 million households.Accelerating the fiber build plan, deploying nearly 57k fiber miles since 2020 and now connecting over 51% of its cell sites with its own fiber.Upgrading 76% of pro sports venues with 5G Ultra Wideband service to provide greater coverage and exponentially more capacity in major gathering and event spaces to better support high data traffic.Redesigning the core of the network to function in a cloud-native environment and introducing advanced technologies such as virtualization, automation and orchestration throughout the network. Introducing virtualization (throughout the core and in over 15,000 cell sites), re-architecting to a Kubernetes-based cloud-native platform, and integrating extensive automation and orchestration have been largely invisible to customers, but those changes are making a world of difference. Not only is Verizon able to make changes that benefit customers faster (like introducing new security measures, improving handoffs between cell sites, improving latency, and reducing call drops) but it can now implement those enhancements without taking the network offline, so customers are getting the benefits with zero down time.Story continuesThese significant changes to the network exponentially increased capacity and performance, created a scalable platform to manage the increase in usage, increased network efficiency, improved security and reliability for customers, and created the platform for exponential growth the company is now seeing.Customer experience and habits have changedThe massive speed and capacity increases resulting from recent network changes have encouraged customers to use more data and do more in more places than ever before. A year after the launch of 5G, about 24% of Verizon customers were on 5G devices. Today, more than 68% of customers have 5G capable cell phones and they are using exponentially more data. At present, 5G traffic using C-band spectrum makes up more than 38% of the total data on the network, up from over 14% one year ago. As 5G data usage increases, there is a correlated decrease of data volume on the 4G network with customers currently using just over 56% compared to a year ago when nearly 81% of data traffic ran over 4G service. This shift results in all customers having a better experience – 5G customers are experiencing the speed and massive capacity of 5G, while 4G customers are seeing increases in performance because so much traffic is shifting onto the 5G network freeing up capacity on the 4G network.Not only are customers using the network more, they are using it differently. Home Internet, Business Internet and Private Networks have altered how, when and where customers access the network. Verizon sees a steady pace of approximately 400,000 net adds for Home Internet each quarter, a majority of which are fixed wireless access (FWA). As of August, over 2.5 million consumer and business customers are using Verizon’s FWA service with each using just over 300 GB of data per month. Private networks are gaining momentum as well with solutions like the Cleveland Clinic and the NFL’s Coach-to-Coach coming online in all 30 NFL stadiums.While customers are using more data and using it differently, the massive network upgrades have enabled customers to have a markedly better experience than ever before. Customers can do things faster, with Ookla showing median 5G download speeds increasing 98.45% since January of 2021* and RootMetrics showing download speeds increasing more than 176% since the second half of 2021 in the top 125 metros tested.** And in rigorous scientific network tests, RootMetrics concluded that Verizon’s network is undefeated in 96.8% of the metro drive tests (121 out of 125 markets) they performed in the first half of 2023.****Based on analysis by Verizon of Ookla® Speedtest Intelligence® data for median 5G download speeds, U.S., Q1 2021 vs. Q2 2023.

They share the experience their customers share, so engineers are working every day, relentlessly, to make the Verizon network even better than it was the day before.This new campaign shows how obsessed Verizon engineers are with providing an amazing experience for customers. In homage to the “Can you hear me now?” campaign, Verizon’s Test Force – a fleet of specialized engineers – test the network relentlessly in all the ways customers use it today - not just for voice calls, but for downloading, texting, streaming, sharing, uploading and so much more.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:There has been a notable improvement in the earnings outlook in recent months, with positive revisions for several key sectors since the start of Q2 helping offset continued pressure on estimates for others. These cross-currents have helped keep the overall earnings picture essentially unchanged since April 2023.For 2023 Q3, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -2.2% from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues, the 4th back-to-back quarter of declining earnings for the index.Excluding the drag from the Energy sector, whose earnings are expected to decline -39.7% in Q3, earnings for the other 15 Zacks sectors in the S&amp;P 500 index would be up +3.1% on +3.5% higher revenues.Estimates for 2023 Q3 are holding up much better than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters. In fact, Q3 earnings estimates in the aggregate are barely down since June 27th, with estimates modestly up when negative revisions to the Energy or Finance sector estimates are excluded.We have regularly been flagging the steady improvement in the revisions trend since April 2023, with the trend becoming more entrenched in recent months. In order to see this improvement, we have to look below the index level to appreciate the cross-current in estimates at the sector levels.The aggregate Q3 earnings estimate for the S&amp;P 500 index has declined about -0.1% since the start of the period, with rising estimates for six sectors, including the Tech sector, offsetting continued weakness of varying magnitudes in the remaining sectors. Had it not been for weakness in the Energy or Finance sector estimates, the revisions trend for Q3 for the S&amp;P 500 index would be modestly positive since the start of the period.Story continuesIn addition to the Tech sector, Q3 estimates have moved higher for the Construction, Autos, Medical, Retail, and Industrials sectors.For the Tech sector, you can see this favorable revisions trend in estimates for operators like Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA and others.As we have noted in this space before, the magnitude of positive revisions that Nvidia is experiencing is in a league of its own.The gains in estimates at Alphabet, Meta, and others are as material and indicative of the overall improving earnings outlook.The long-feared recession doesn't show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn't leave much room for a recession either.Given the emerging consensus on the 'soft-landing' outlook for the economy, one can expect this favorable turn in the overall earnings picture to strengthen further as companies report Q3 results and share trends in underlying business.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

""I will say that we've got a pretty substantial silicon investment that we've had for years. The thing that we will do is make sure we're making the best choices for how we build these systems, using whatever options are available.

(Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Vox Media) (Jerod Harris via Getty Images)Scott was also cagey about whether Microsoft would ever move on or diversify away from its Nvidia partnership, such as by pursuing chips from AMD (AMD).But he did say that, from the customer perspective, it shouldn't make a difference where the chips powering their AI experiences come from.""For us, it's a big complicated software stack, but the only part the customer sees is the API interface,"" he told the audience.Though the industry is in the midst of a headline-making AI chip shortage, Scott was optimistic about the chips that are out there right now and the trajectory that the technology is on.""Chips are getting better price [and] performance-wise generation over generation,"" Scott said, adding: ""The software techniques that we're using to optimize the models are bringing tons of performance without compromise to quality.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

AMAT, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO, McKesson Corp. MCK and NetEase Inc. NTES.Dive into Dividends: Top 5 Bargain Growth Stocks to BuyVolatility and uncertainty in the stock market have taken the front seat in recent weeks on worries over higher interest rates for a longer time. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems to be a prudent option to fight the current market turmoil. Though dividend-paying stocks don't offer dramatic price appreciation, they provide a consistent income stream.In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Applied Materials Inc., PulteGroup Inc., Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc., McKesson Corp. and NetEase Inc.— that could be compelling picks for investors.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 12 stocks that fit the bill:California-based Applied Materials is one of the world's largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules. The company has a P/E ratio of 17.29 compared with the industry average of 22.12.

CTLT is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its product and service launches over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with a slew of strategic deals over the past few months, is expected to contribute further. Catalent’s operation in a competitive landscape and forex fluctuations pose threats.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 40.2% compared with the 8.5% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 15.1% growth in the said time frame.The renowned global developer and supplier of better treatments has a market capitalization of $8.23 billion. Catalent projects 18% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Catalent’s earnings yield of 1.8% is favorable to the industry’s negative yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product and Service Launches: We are upbeat about Catalent’s product and service launches over the past few months. In March, Catalent announced the launch of the ProteoSuite Oral suite, which allows the rational selection of orally developable targeted protein degrader candidates and their advancement into clinical trials. The same month, Catalent announced the expansion of its UpTempo platform process for the development and cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) manufacturing of adeno-associated viral vectors.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about Catalent’s robust growth opportunities via its recent tie-ups and buyouts. In August, the company entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Elliott Investment Management L.P., one of Catalent’s investors. This agreement is likely to improve operational efficiencies and drive long-term value.In March, the company signed a commercial supply agreement with Harm Reduction Therapeutics.Strong Q4 Results: Catalent’s solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment. Management’s confirmation regarding Catalent’s continued progress in improving its operational performance and winning new business with new and existing customers raises our optimism.Story continuesDownsidesForex Fluctuations: Catalent has significant operations outside the United States. Hence, changes in the exchange rates or any other applicable currency to the U.S. dollar will affect its operations. Volatility in currency exchange rates and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort the company may undertake to manage or mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies.Stiff Competition: Catalent operates in a highly competitive market, wherein it competes with multiple companies, including those offering advanced delivery technologies and outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing. The company also competes in some cases with the internal operations of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health customers with manufacturing capabilities and chooses to source these services internally.Estimate TrendCatalent has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 43.1% south to 82 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $933.2 million, suggesting an 8.7% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.DaVita, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

DXCM and privately-held RxFood Corporation have entered into an agreement to bring their respective expertise together and introduce an improved digital health solution for those with diabetes. The companies have partnered to introduce such services currently in Canada.RxFood is a leading company in the medical nutrition therapy segment. It uses powerful Artificial Intelligence models that help in dietary assessments and recommendations leveraging images of foods consumed by the users. The company is trying to create an impression of personalized nutrition and food as medicine.RxFood app has been primarily tested on families with diabetic children. Clinical data demonstrated that the app has helped reduce the time associated with day-to-day diabetes management for children by parents. The company’s technology enables personalized care recommendations by providing more complete food records with higher accuracy (compared to manual entries) to clinicians.Price PerformanceShares of DexCom have lost 21.7% year to date compared with the industry’s 8.9% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 14.2% growth in the said time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSignificance of the DealDexCom is already providing a cutting-edge technology through its continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems like G6, G7 and others that is leading to better management of diabetes. The company’s CGM technology has made it a leader in the diabetes care technology segment.DXCM has always focused on bringing industry-leading technology to improve and transform day-to-day management of diabetes. It will now introduce automatic food and nutrition tracking (with the help of RxFood app’s image-recognition technology) to its CGM users.The company believes that continuous glucose monitoring is a key part of diabetes management but type, amount and timing of food intake are also important. The partnership will provide unified, time-matched food and glucose data reports. The addition of RxFood app to DexCom’s CGM universe will help seamless recording of dietary metrics, which when combined with glucose data will enable personalized nutritional guidance at scale.Story continuesThe combined system will be available to Canadians with diabetes, following the commercial launch of Dexcom G6 CGM system or the Dexcom G7 CGM system. Currently, the RxFood app, featuring the Dexcom CGM glucose data integration, is available to health care program stakeholders across Canada including hospitals, insurers and employers.We note that DXCM is also partnering with automated insulin delivery makers like Insulet Corporation’s PODD. The company’s progress with its services will likely lead to the creation of an ecosystem, which will lead to more seamless diabetes management for patients through glucose monitoring, dietary assessment and insulin delivery, all without manual intervention. An efficient diabetes management system should lead to the accelerated adoption of DXCM’s products.Notable DevelopmentsEarlier this month, DexCom announced that its G6 CGM system can now connect with the Insulet Corporation’s Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system in Germany. Insulet’s Omnipod 5 automatically adjusts insulin delivery and manages glucose levels both day and night. Insulet’s Omnipod 5 AID system is cleared for individuals with type 1 diabetes, aged 2 years and older.In July, DexCom announced that its next-generation G7 CGM system received Health Canada’s approval for people with all types of diabetes, aged two years and above. The DexCom G7 has been built on the performance of DexCom CGM, which has been clinically proven to lower A1C, reduce hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and improve time in range.DexCom, Inc.

492,ce6c687d-7fe5-3a11-a9de-a16cf8b85b4d,MCK,2023-09-28,Dive Into Dividends: Top 5 Bargain Growth Stocks to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dive-dividends-top-5-bargain-114800981.html,1695815280,STORY,"['ARCO', 'MCK', 'AMAT', '9999.HK', 'PHM']","[Volatility and uncertainty in the stock market have taken the front seat in recent weeks on worries over higher interest rates for longer time. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems to be a prudent option to fight the current market turmoil. Though dividend-paying stocks don’t offer dramatic price appreciation, they provide a consistent income stream.In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO, McKesson Corporation MCK and NetEase Inc. NTES — that could be compelling picks for investors.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 12.Here are five of the 12 stocks that fit the bill:California-based Applied Materials is one of the world’s largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules. The company has a P/E ratio of 17.29 compared with the industry average of 22.12. It has an estimated growth rate of 2.60% for the fiscal year (ending October 2023).Applied Materials has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.

The company has a P/E ratio of 6.36 compared with the industry average of 8.15. Its earnings are estimated to grow 7.6% for this year.PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of B.Argentina-based Arcos Dorados operates as a franchisee of McDonald's, with its operations divided in Brazil, North Latin America, South Latin America and the Caribbean divisions. It also runs quick-service restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean. Arcos Dorados has a P/E ratio of 12.17 compared with the industry average of 20.73 and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 13%.  Arcos Dorados has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.California-based McKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company. The stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.2% for the fiscal year (ending March 2024). It has a P/E ratio of 16.51 compared with the industry average of 21.81.McKesson has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.Beijing-based NetEase is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services and other technologies in China.

INSP is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its focus on research and development (R&amp;D). The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and a few regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on the Inspire system and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.1% against the industry’s 32.1% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 19.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical technology company focused on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has a market capitalization of $5.43 billion. The company projects 74.4% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Inspire Medical has delivered an earnings surprise of 45.6% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Focus on R&amp;D: Inspire Medical’s foundational commitment to driving innovation and improving patient lives fuels its continuous product development, raising our optimism. Per management, the company intends to invest in existing and next-generation technologies to further improve its products and clinical outcomes, optimize patient acceptance and comfort and broaden the patient population that can benefit from Inspire therapy. Recent examples of Inspire Medical’s product innovation include the next generation of the Inspire neurostimulator, which is in development, and an active project to improve the physician programmer.Regulatory Approvals: We are upbeat about Inspire Medical’s receipt of a slew of FDA approvals over the past few months. In June 2023, Inspire Medical submitted a premarket approval supplement to the FDA for its next-generation Inspire system. Also, in June 2023, it received approval from the FDA on an expanded indication, which includes an increase on the upper limit of the Apnea Hypopnea Index to 100 events per hour from 65, and raises the Body Mass Index warning in the labeling to 40 from 32.Strong Q2 Results: Inspire Medical’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust improvement in the top line and strength in year-over-year geographic results. Activation of new U.S. centers and the creation of new U.S. sales territories were also recorded during the reported quarter.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on Inspire System: Sales of Inspire Medical’s Inspire system accounted for primarily all its revenues for the past few years. The company’s ability to execute its growth strategy and become profitable will, therefore, depend upon the adoption of the Inspire therapy to treat moderate-to-severe OSA in patients who are unable to use or get consistent benefits from continuous positive airway pressure. Management cannot ensure that the company’s Inspire therapy will achieve or maintain broad market acceptance among physicians and patients.Stiff Competition: The medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Inspire Medical’s competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat moderate to severe OSA.Estimate TrendInspire Medical has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has widened from $1.18 to $1.76.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $155.2 million, suggesting a 42.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.DaVita, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

(NYSE: TRV) today released its 2023 Travelers Risk Index results, and for the ninth straight year, cyber threats were one of the top three business concerns among the 1,200 survey participants from small-, medium- and large-sized companies.Of those taking the national survey, 58% said they worry some or a great deal about cyber, ranking it just behind medical cost inflation (60%) and broad economic uncertainty (59%).Tim Francis, Enterprise Cyber Lead at Travelers, said, ""Cyber risks have extremely serious consequences – one attack can weaken an organization or potentially put it out of business. Fortunately, there are effective measures that companies can take to address vulnerabilities and successfully manage through a cyber event.""Respondents expressed confidence that their company had implemented best cyber practices. However, according to their responses, at least 25% of businesses have not taken essential steps, such as installing firewall or virus protection and implementing data backup and password updates. A much larger percentage say they don’t use endpoint detection and response (64%), conduct cyber assessments for vendors (57%) or customers’ assets (56%), have an incident response plan (50%), or utilize multifactor authentication for remote access (44%).CyberattacksNearly one-quarter of survey participants (23%) said their company has suffered a cyberattack, with almost half of those (49%) occurring in the last 12 months.Phishing emails, when a cybercriminal convinces an employee to transfer company funds to a fraudulent account, have been on the rise. The percentage of survey respondents from large companies who said they’ve experienced a phishing scam nearly doubled in the past year, from 14% to 27%. A security breach, when someone gains unauthorized access to a company’s computer system, remains the most common event among companies of all sizes, accounting for nearly one-third (32%) of attacks.Story continuesOther Notable FindingsAdditional highlights from the survey include:Ransomware ranked ninth among cyber-specific business worries, despite it being a leading cause of cyber-related claims in the industry.Among medium-sized businesses, 74% said they have a cyber policy, up from 67% in 2022. Large companies came in at 72%, the same percentage as a year ago, while small businesses (34%) are still the least likely to secure cyber insurance coverage. Overall, 60% said their company has cyber insurance; five years ago, it was 39%.Awareness of cyber-specific risks keeps increasing: 81% of respondents feel that having proper cybersecurity controls in place is critical to the well-being of their company, up from 78% last year and 69% in 2018.""While the business community has come a long way in preparing for and responding to a cyberattack, the survey results show that more can still be done,"" Francis added. ""A well-designed, multi-layered cybersecurity program can help mitigate the threat of a cyber event, and we encourage organizations to work closely with their independent insurance agent as we all navigate an evolving cyber landscape.""In recognition of national Cybersecurity Awareness Month, the Travelers Institute, Travelers’ public policy division, will host three educational programs for the business community and broader public in October to help increase cyber preparedness. In-person programs that are part of the Travelers Institute’s Cyber: Prepare, Prevent, Mitigate, Restore symposium series will take place Oct. 17 in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Oct. 20 in Kansas City, Missouri.

Moreover, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) paints an optimistic picture of a hydrogen market swelling to a staggering $1 trillion annually.Fueling this enthusiasm further, the U.S. Department of Energy proposed to inject a whopping $1 billion into hydrogen initiatives. As the landscape shifts, it’s resonated by projections from the Hydrogen Energy Association, which anticipates hydrogen fulfilling an impressive 14% of U.S. energy needs by 2050. In this electrifying transition, now might be the opportune moment for investors to consider enriching their portfolios with three of the best hydrogen stocks.Best Hydrogen Stocks: Plug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), a standout in the hydrogen fuel domain with over 60,000 fuel cell deployments globally, has proven resilient to the volatility in the stock market. While many wavered, Plug marched to the beat of its own drum, exemplified by a stellar 72% revenue increase in the second quarter to an impressive $260.18 million. That performance eclipsed market expectations by a noteworthy 8%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMoreover, after clinching a significant deal in Australia, Plug Power made a pronounced entry into the European oil and gas market with its 100 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer, reducing approximately 516 tons of CO2 daily. Moreover, a new agreement with Blue EnerFreeze, part of the STEF group, aims to establish a green hydrogen ecosystem at two primary distribution centers, with the potential to expand to many more in the future.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products truck on motorway. APD stock.Source: Bjoern Wylezich / ShutterstockStory continuesAir Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) stands out as a compelling consideration for savvy investors in the ever-evolving universe of green hydrogen. Despite a recent 6% decline post-earnings, TipRanks analysts project a bright horizon, with an average price target of $328.40, pointing to a promising 14% upside. Currently valued with a forward price-earnings ratio of 26 and providing a 2.43% dividend yield, APD exudes an enticing financial profile.Moreover, a robust third quarter saw adjusted earnings soar to $2.98 per share, marking an impressive 16% annual uptick. As forecasts hint at a 4% to 6% ascent in fourth-quarter earnings per share, APD’s trajectory demonstrates robust momentum.The story continues to unfold. APD’s involvement in Saudi Arabia’s NEOM Green Hydrogen Company is set to deliver 600 tonnes of carbon-free hydrogen each day. Added to that is a sizable 1.6 billion CAD project in Canada and a significant $4 billion partnership with AES Corp (NYSE:AES) in Texas.Linde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comStanding tall as the world’s largest industrial gas titan, Linde (NYSE:LIN) is undeniably a force in its domain. Recent catalysts amplify its allure. The company had robust second-quarter financials, with reported sales hitting the $8.2 billion mark and earnings-per-share at $3.57, marking a 15% year-over-year bump — outshining expectations. Even more tantalizing, Linde nudged its full-year earnings-per-share forecast upwards, aiming for a commendable 12% to 14% year-over-year growth.But Linde’s narrative isn’t confined to figures alone. Early this year, the firm unveiled its ambitious plans for green hydrogen projects across the U.S., reflecting its commitment to sustainability. Linde’s robust track record speaks volumes as the LIN stock ascends, marking a 34.56% year-over-year bump and inching towards its 52-week high of $393.Moreover, Linde’s recent ventures extend its footprint further. Key renewable energy agreements in Brazil and collaborations like fueling the world’s maiden hydrogen-powered ferry and teaming up with Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) in Texas are a testament to Linde’s forward-thinking prowess.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The companies have strong catalysts behind them, which could attract investor enthusiasm. Many of the companies on this list already built up good momentum and look primed for takeoff.Despite the economy throwing mixed signals, there’s still a good chance these companies could move to new heights. They are suitable for holding as a short-term momentum play or a long-term investment.So here are the best hydrogen stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is poised to be a significant player in the global green hydrogen market. Plug Power is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for green hydrogen, especially in sectors that are challenging to decarbonize.There have been some developments for PLUG stock, which could make investors feel bullish. Northland analyst Abhishek Sinha raised Plug Power’s rating, highlighting its path to cash flow generation and forecasting break-even margins by 2023. Free cash flow is an important objective measure of a company’s intrinsic value.On the technicals for PLUG stock, things also look attractive. It trades below its long-term moving averages, which implies additional upside. It’s also below its consensus analyst price target of $17.93.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is a global leader in supplying industrial gases and has a vast infrastructure of over 100 hydrogen plants worldwide.Things also look very positive for APD stock. It is currently in an ascending parallel channel, with some analysts predicting it could reach $350 by the end of 2023. The stock has shown growth from support of $281 since August 2023, trading above multiple daily moving averages.APD also impresses when it comes to its fundamentals. A return on equity (ROE) of 15% indicates it generated $0.15 in profit for every $1 of shareholders’ equity. That’s in line with the sector. However, it’s unusual for hydrogen stocks to have a positive ROE since most of its resources are tied up in expanding growth. That helps make APD one of those hydrogen stocks to buy now.Story continuesLinde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comLinde (NYSE:LIN) is rapidly establishing itself as a major supplier of electrolyzers used for green hydrogen production. As the world’s largest industrial gas supplier, Linde generated $33 billion in revenue in 2022. The stock’s current price is $385.6 at the time of writing, with its estimated fair value at $352.21 by some analyst estimates.However, these estimates were based purely on the present value of its future cash flows. On the stock’s technicals, it has been in an upward ascending channel since the middle of the year. It used this channel as support, with prices bouncing off them during this period.Momentum is also firmly on the upside, giving it more of a bullish bias compared to some of the other stocks on this list. The trend is, therefore, expected to continue. Analysts expect to see another positive quarter from LIN stock, so we could see it enter into breakout territory. That helps make it one of those hydrogen stocks to buy now.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis and recent news and developments in movie and news media, then head straight to the Top 5 Movie Studio and News Media Stocks. In the fast-changing media landscape, three major stories are making waves. Disney contemplates parting with ABC, Rupert Murdoch exits as chairman of Fox and News Corp, and a breakthrough may be in sight as studios make final offers to end a prolonged writers' strike. So, Why is Disney Selling ABC?Recent reports have indicated that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is in preliminary discussions to sell ABC to Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST), a media conglomerate with an extensive network of local TV stations and well-known networks such as CW and NewsNation. While these talks have garnered attention, it's worth noting that no formal steps have been taken in terms of hiring bankers or circulating sales documentation. Insiders familiar with the situation suggest that Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXST) might face challenges meeting Disney's asking price for ABC.The idea of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) parting with ABC was initially floated by former CEO Bob Iger back in June. In an interview with CNBC, Iger hinted that traditional television assets, including ABC, may no longer be considered core to Disney's future strategy. This shift in perspective suggests that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is exploring new horizons and considering a more expansive approach to the television business. However, Iger also acknowledged the significant creative contributions that networks like ABC have made to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) over the years, leaving the door open to the possibility of a sale while emphasizing the value of the content and creativity that these networks have brought to the entertainment giant.Hollywood's Showdown: Inside the 2023 Writer's StrikeThe 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on May 2, 2023, stands as a significant disruption in American television and film production, similar to the setbacks witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the WGA's substantial labor strike in 2007-08. Story continuesRepresenting 11,500 screenwriters, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) is locked in an ongoing labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The strike's central issues revolve around the lack of agreement on a new contract, with writers advocating for improved compensation, enhanced funding and job security, larger writers' rooms, and limitations on the use of artificial intelligence in the writing process.The WGA's demands encompass AI regulations, adjusted pay structures to replace residuals, writers' room preservation, streaming pay standards, and job security. Notably, the Guild's proposals, as estimated by the WGA, could potentially cost studios $429 million annually, while studio counterproposals have been substantially lower, at $86 million.This strike has disrupted TV and film production, gaining support from Hollywood luminaries expressing backing for strike authorization on social media.High-level talks between studios and writers, involving key industry figures like Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s Bob Iger, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal film head Donna Langley, are ongoing. These negotiations come as media companies grapple with making streaming profitable and reviving theater attendance.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), in their securities filing in early September, adjusted their earnings expectations, anticipating a significant loss of $300 million to $500 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, with a full-year range of $10.5 billion to $11 billion, due to the strikes.Zaslav, at Goldman Sachs' Communacopia and Technology conference the next day on September 6, stressed the need to resolve the strikes swiftly, emphasizing the industry's commitment to a fair resolution. “We need to do everything we can to get people back to work,” Zaslav said at the investors’ conference. “We really have to focus as an industry, and we are, on trying to get this resolved in a way that’s really fair.”As of September 20, 2023, optimism surrounds the potential finalization of a deal by Thursday, though there's a warning that without an agreement, the strike could persist throughout the year, further affecting the industry and its stakeholders.Why is Rupert Murdoch Stepping Down?Rupert Murdoch, the iconic leader of News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA). and Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA), is stepping down as chairman to become chairman emeritus after a storied seven-decade career. His eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will assume the role of sole chairman at News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) and continue as Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA)'s executive and CEO. Rupert Murdoch's transition will take effect at the upcoming mid-November shareholder meetings. This move solidifies Lachlan's position as his father's successor, overseeing entities like the New York Post, Fox News, and Fox Entertainment.In a memo shared with CBS News, Murdoch emphasized that he's stepping back while in excellent health, while also stating that it's the opportune moment for him to embrace new roles.Armed with recent headlines about media and news companies, it's valuable to have insights into the stocks of movie studios and news media companies.Without further ado, let's move to the list of top movie studio and news media stocks.Movie Studio and News Media Stocks ListOur Methodology To create our list of movie studio and news media stocks, we initially gathered the largest movie studio and news media stocks listed on U.S. exchanges, focusing on their market capitalization (as of the writing of this piece) as the ranking metric of our list.

Each night, his primetime program features a signature monologue where he breaks down trending topics of the day, followed by headline-generating interviews. Hannity ended August 2023 as the number one rated program in cable news in the 25-54 demo and averages 2.4 million viewers each night year-to-date, routinely ranking in the top five programs overall.Throughout his FNC tenure, he has interviewed numerous key newsmakers and political figures, including most recently actor and director Sean Penn, former President Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then-President George W.

His eponymous program has dominated the cable news landscape, ranking number one in its time slot with both viewers and in the 25-54 demo for 13 consecutive years since launching as a solo hour in January 2009, according to Nielsen Media Research. His debut program, Hannity &amp; Colmes with the late Alan Colmes, became a ratings hit and overtook Larry King after just five years of its existence, ranking as top-rated program in its timeslot beginning in 2002 in the key demo and in 2003 with viewers. From 2017 to 2019, Hannity reigned as the most-watched program in all of cable news in the coveted 25-54 demo and marked four consecutive years as the most-watched show in total viewers (2017-2020).FOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service and has been the number one network in basic cable for the last six years and the most-watched television news channel for more than 21 consecutive years, currently attracting nearly 50% of the cable news viewing audience according to Nielsen Media Research.

(AP) — Facing a backlash, Walt Disney World's governing district will pay a stipend to employees whose free passes and discounts to the theme park resort were eliminated under a policy made by a new district administrator and board members who are allies of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.The stipend will be $3,000 a year, which is around the equivalent value of the theme park passes, Glen Gilzean, district administrator of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, told board members during a meeting Wednesday evening. The board then unanimously approved the stipend.Board members said they had taken to heart the criticism of employees who said the free passes gave them lasting memories with their families and allowed relatives to see the fruits of their work. Without the free passes, the parks would be unaffordable, many employees said.“We heard you and have worked to respond accordingly,” said board member Ron Peri.Employees had enjoyed the perk for decades when Disney controlled the governing district. The district was taken over by DeSantis and the Florida Legislature earlier this year in retaliation to Disney’s opposition last year to a state law critics have called “ Don't Say Gay,” which banned classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. Formerly known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the now renamed Central Florida Tourism Oversight District provides municipal services like mosquito control, drainage and wastewater treatment.In justifying their elimination, board members claimed the $2.5 million in theme park season passes, as well as discounts on hotels, merchandise, food and beverages, that their Disney-supporting predecessors provided governing district employees amounted to unethical benefits and perks.The arrangement was self-serving to the company because it funneled money back to Disney, with the district footing the bill, according to board members. Outside experts, though, have likened it more to an employee benefit rather than a taxpayer scam, similar to the way professors at a university may get free passes to athletic events or free tuition for family members.Story continues“The old way this program was structured could no longer legally be continued,” board member Brian Aungst said Wednesday evening.DeSantis, who is campaigning for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, took over the the governing district previously controlled by Disney allies through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But the new supervisors’ authority over design and construction was restricted by the company’s agreements with Disney-supporting predecessors, which were signed before the new board took over.In response, Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney has sued DeSantis in federal court, claiming the governor violated the company’s free speech rights. The district has sued Disney in state court, seeking to nullify the agreements.___Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.]"

In response, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery shares rose more than 2% each, followed by Netflix and Disney whose shares went up 1% and 0.5% respectively. The WGA contract could act as a template for Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) to draft its own deal with the studios.AMPTP Has Adhered To WGA’s DemandsThe Writers Guild of America which represents 11,500 film and television writers successfully fought for an increase in minimum pay, a new residual for streaming based on viewership and limiting the use of artificial intelligence. The guild negotiated also negotiated better right in streaming with a new residual based on viewership.New Streaming StructureStreamers like Netflix will be obliged to provide the guild with statistics such as the number of hours streamed both domestically and internationally for self-produced high budget streaming programs. With the new residual implies that high budget subscription video on demand series and films that are viewed by 20% or more of the service’s domestic subscribers during the frst 90 days of release get a bonus equal to 50% of the fixed domestic and foreign residual.AI Restrictions To Protect WritersThe use of AI to write or rewrite literary material has been prohibited with AI-generated content will not be considered as source material.Contract TermsThe agreed upon deal will last until May 2026 and once ratified, it includes a 5% minimum pay increase along with another 4% rise expected in May 2024 and a 3.5% increase in May 2025. WGA members can vote in favor or against the contract until October 9th.Story continuesThe AMPTP Also Needs To Deal With SAG-AFTRAA five-month strike ended with better compensation and protection for writers but producers need to make a deal with SAG-AFTRA that is representing 160,000 film and television actors, stunt performers, voiceover artists and other media professionals. Although their requests are similar to those requested by writer, they have some additional requests such as the standardization of the self-tape process, which became popular during the pandemic, as actors have observed inequity in auditioning between those who can afford quality camera and lighting equipment and those who can’t. When SAG-AFTRA joined the strike in mid-July, it literally put Hollywood on pause as this was the first time in 63 years that two unions went on strike at the same time.The Damage Goes Beyond BillionsAccording to an estimate from Milken Institute economist Kevin Klowden, the economic cost of the two strikes costed California and other U.S. production hubs at least $5 billion. But the damage goes beyond billions, beginning with Disney who has been exploring AI possibilities in an effort to cut its costs, enraging writers and actors who fought fiercely over the last 150 days to limit the industry’s exploration of this technology. The once-beloved Disney CEO Bob Iger is no longer America’s most beloved CEO. Disney has already been dealing with several internal issues and an urgent need to reinvent its linear TV model in the streaming age, but Iger’s return didn’t helped bring back the magic. Moreover, by finding the demands of the unions ‘unrealistic’, Iger threatened the image of the world’s biggest entertainment company, and damaged his legacy, failing to find a diplomatic way out of this blunt statement. The cost of the strikes only made the already challenging remaking of Disney more difficult, with the deal further limiting Disney in exploiting the cost-cutting possibilities of AI.New Rules Are In PlayAlthough it is more challenging to evaluate the standing of Apple and Amazon when it comes to streaming as they report their results as part of larger divisions, Netflix showed during the strike that it is undoubtedly in a better shape compared to its rivals, especially Disney whose stock crashed to the lowest level in nine years at the end of August. Although Netflix didn’t tell the whole story of its successful projects, it was at least more transparent compared to its reluctant rivals by posting weekly updates about its best-performing content. In contrast, Amazon and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) never revealed how well any of their original productions have performed on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV Plus. But from now on, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Disney will need to reveal more official viewership data, kicking off a massive power shift on the streaming front and in the overall industry.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

OKE announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. This $18.8-billion merger deal created one of the largest oil and natural gas pipeline companies in the United States. The initiative is focused on providing consumers with essential energy goods and services and enabling better return opportunity for investors by creating a more diversified North American midstream infrastructure company.The transaction involves ONEOK's acquisition of all outstanding units of Magellan through a mixture of cash and stock. Magellan’s unitholders received $25.00 in cash and 0.667 shares of ONEOK common stock for each outstanding Magellan common unit. Magellan common units will no longer be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.Benefits of the MergerThe acquisition of Magellan by ONEOK is likely to have a positive impact on the prospects of the combined company.Owing to the acquisition, ONEOK will have access to Magellan's assets and customers that will allow it to expand operations and develop new revenue sources. Additionally, it is anticipated to produce considerable cost savings and synergies, enhancing the profitability of the merged company. ONEOK expects to achieve annual cost savings of nearly $200 million from this merger.The agreement will open up Magellan's primarily fee-based refined products and crude oil transportation business to ONEOK. The combined infrastructure company is expected to generate stable cash flows even through diverse commodity cycles.  In the first four years, the combined company is expected to generate an average annual amount of around $1 billion. This represents a significant improvement in free cash flow after dividends and growth capital.Oil &amp; Gas Sector’s ConsolidationThe oil and gas sector has experienced significant consolidation over the years, with many large companies acquiring smaller ones. This trend is expected to continue as companies look to streamline operations and reduce costs.Other companies like Chevron Corporation CVX and Liberty Energy LBRT are also expanding their operations through mergers and acquisitions.In August 2023, Chevron completed its acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. following approval from PDC Energy shareholders. The purchase gives the global energy giant 275,000 net acres in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, next to assets already operated by Chevron, and 25,000 net acres in the Permian Basin where Chevron already has a leading position.CVX’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 14.27%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.8% in the last four quarters.In April 2023, Liberty Energy announced the purchase of Siren Energy — an integrated natural gas compression and CNG transportation company with a Permian focus. The latter offered transportation, logistics and pressure-reduction services in addition to two expandable Permian sites with a 16-MMcf-per-day capability for natural gas compression. Subject to customary closing adjustments, Liberty Energy paid an overall cash price of $78 million to acquire Siren.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LBRT's 2023 earnings per share (EPS) indicates a 46.5% increase year over year. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 12.1% in the last four quarters.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the past three months, ONEOK’s shares have risen 11.8% compared with the industry’s 7.5% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderONEOK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the same sector is Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today released  a new State of the Internet report that explores existing and emerging cyberattacks against the financial services industry. The new report, The High Stakes of Innovation: Attack Trends in Financial Services, includes regional data as well as a look into what is driving the increased number of attacks against the sector.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)The report notes that application and API attacks in the financial services vertical grew by 65% when comparing Q2 2022 with Q2 2023. This amounts to more than 9 billion attacks over a period of 18 months. The attacks were driven in part by cybercriminal groups conducting zero-day and one-day vulnerability abuse as pathways for initial intrusion. The High Stakes of Innovation: Attack Trends in Financial Services report shows that financial services has surpassed gaming as the top vertical for DDoS attacks. This is due to Layer 3 and Layer 4 DDoS attacks caused by the dramatic surge in the power of virtual machine botnets and hacktivism motivated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The High Stakes of Innovation: Attack Trends in Financial Services features commentary and recommendations from Teresa Walsh, Global Head of Intelligence for the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC). She writes, ""One of the key threat vectors facing the global financial sector is supply chain risk. As shown by Akamai's research, the significant increase in attacks and vulnerabilities through third-party APIs and scripts requires firms to take an increasingly active approach to hardening systems and third-party risk management more broadly.""Other key findings of the report include:The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region accounts for 63.5% of DDoS events. The number of attacks against this region nearly doubled the number for the next top region. This is likely due to political motivations of attack groups against European banks.Financial services remains the most targeted web attack vertical in the Asia, Pacific, Japan (APJ) region, which experienced nearly 50% of all web application and API attacks during the reporting period.The rapidly climbing number of malicious bot requests (1.1 trillion), which increased by 69%, exemplifies the continued assault against customers and their data through attacks like account takeover and the risks posed by financial aggregators.Although the financial services vertical has fewer third-party scripts than other industries, at 30%, they are prone to attacks like web skimming. However, financial services entities are proactively fighting back with the adoption of solutions to comply with the new requirements of PCI DSS 4.0.Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities are driving the surge in web application and API attacks with 53% growth in the last year. LFI has consistently remained the top web attack vector.Story continues""Financial services is heavily targeted by attackers with both old and new security threats,"" said Steve Winterfeld, Advisory CISO at Akamai. ""The High Stakes of Innovation: Attack Trends in Financial Services evaluates Akamai's massive volume of threat traffic to provide insights and analysis that will help this sector defend critical data and improve security for customers.""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

The locations in Amsterdam, Netherlands; Jakarta, Indonesia; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Milan, Italy; Osaka, Japan; and São Paulo, Brazil, are the third installment of Akamai's rollout of new core compute regions since its acquisition of Linode last year, and represent a key step in Akamai's push to redefine how the cloud operates.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)With the addition of São Paulo and Miami, Akamai makes it easier for companies to do business in Latin America. The two new core compute regions make Akamai an attractive competitor in a market long dominated by larger hyperscale providers. Akamai's entry into São Paulo lets customers run workloads in one of the southern hemisphere's most populated cities and countries, removing a significant economic and performance hurdle that today requires workloads to transit across continents. São Paulo and Miami are representative of Akamai's push to establish core compute regions in hard-to-access markets around the world, connecting them to the same underlying backbone that powers its edge network today — a massively distributed footprint spanning more than 4,100 edge PoPs across 131 countries.Akamai is changing how organizations approach cloud architecture, emphasizing a more distributed and decentralized, low-latency, and globally scalable design. Akamai's cloud computing services are ideal for higher-performance workloads that need to run closer to end users, like those often found in streaming media, gaming, and ecommerce applications. The services are part of Akamai Connected Cloud, a massively distributed edge and cloud platform for cloud computing, security, and content delivery that keeps applications and experiences closer, and threats farther away.Story continues""The need for companies to provide a better user experience increasingly exposes the limits of the legacy centralized cloud model,"" said Adam Karon, chief operating officer and general manager, Cloud Technology Group, Akamai. ""We're solving this challenge for customers by flipping the script. With Akamai Connected Cloud, we're taking an outside-in, distributed-first approach built on a commitment to cloud-native technologies and the same network many of the world's largest companies have relied on for more than two decades. It's an approach focused on a future where scale becomes as much about the size of the network as it does the size of the data center.""Seven New Global Core Compute RegionsThe latest batch of strategic new core compute regions will begin to come online and be available to customers throughout September and October. They expand Akamai's cloud computing network to key data-intensive connection points that will ultimately allow customers to bring improved connectivity and experience to end users.Akamai's new region in Amsterdam is home to the second-largest internet exchange in the world. It joins Akamai's recently launched Stockholm region to power customers in northwest Europe with a new level of cloud connectivity.The company's Jakarta region is located in the heart of a nation experiencing a rapidly growing digital economy. Indonesia is anticipated to increase its number of internet users by 36 million by 2028.Akamai's new core compute region in Los Angeles, a leader in the global media and entertainment market, is positioned to expand the company's robust services in an industry in which for years it has honed considerable expertise and a deep enterprise customer bench.The company's Miami-based core compute region lets the company better serve customers doing business in Latin America, bringing Akamai's distributed connectivity to a rapidly growing business hub, which has seen an explosion of tech talent and venture capital investment.Akamai's presence in Milan puts a stake in the ground in Italy's second-largest city. The Italian market for cloud services grew 250% from 2015 to 2022. In addition to serving customers in Europe, the location will also support customers in the Middle East.The company's new Osaka region will connect Japan's population of 125 million to the massively scalable Akamai backbone. Japan ranks eighth in the world for countries with the largest digital populations.With one of the largest and hardest-to-reach digital populations in Latin America, São Paulo is Akamai's first core compute region in Latin America, with additional connectivity planned later this year.Over the past 90 days, Akamai has opened 13 new core compute regions. Today's announced regions join existing locations in Atlanta, Dallas, Fremont, Newark, Toronto, Frankfurt, London, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo, and recently announced regions in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Paris, Stockholm, Seattle, and Chennai. Akamai plans to roll out more global core compute regions later this year.More information about Akamai Connected Cloud and Akamai's cloud computing services is available on the Akamai website.About Akamai TechnologiesAkamai powers and protects life online.

Crude demand destruction will clearly happen globally if this bond market selloff extends,” added Moya.Moya put major support for Brent at $87.75 and WTI at $84. That would mean a downside of another $5 to $7 in both the benchmarks if de-risking extends.WTI for delivery in November settled at $91.71 per barrel, down $1.97, or 2.1%, on the day. It earlier reached $95.04, its highest since August 2022. On Wednesday alone the U.S, crude benchmark jumped 3.7%.London-traded Brent for December delivery settled at $93.10 a barrel. That was down $1.26, or 1.3%, on the day. On Wednesday, it rose 2.1%.OPEC+ production squeezes ... helped by U.S. producersOil prices have gained between $25 and $30 from May lows of beneath $64 for WTI and $72 for Brent. The rally was largely in response to production squeezes by Saudi Arabia and Russia in their bid to “balance” the market — or rather create an imbalance so great between short supplies and stagnant demand that prices would have no choice but to rise.Story continuesThe two prime movers of the OPEC+ alliance — which bands the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers steered by Russia — have also benefited from a tacit collusion by U.S. oil producers.While antitrust laws forbid U.S. energy companies from participating in OPEC-like schemes that are against the spirit of free-market competition, American oil majors, lured by the Saudi bent in getting a barrel back to above $100, have restrained production too whenever possible in the name of returning cash to shareholders.Demand for U.S. crude has, however, exploded internationally as it began to fill some international markets underserved by the Saudi-Russian squeeze. That has led to a plunge in inventory levels at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that serves as a central delivery and storage point for U.S. crude. This is especially so with the pick up in shipments of a new U.S. crude grade called WTI Midland — which is comparable to the viscosity of the heavier Arab and Russian oils versus the typically light-grade that’s WTI.OANDA’s Moya isn’t the only one who thinks the oil rally will have to cool with the global economy.Long oil: An overcrowded tradeReuters' market analyst John Kemp says oil traders have placed so many bullish bets on crude prices that the trade has become overcrowded and was due for a correction.In his latest column on oil buying among institutional traders, Kemp pointed out that over the past four weeks, traders had bought a total of 183 million barrels of crude and fuel futures. That has brought the total up to 525 million barrels. More importantly, the ratio of bullish to bearish bets on oil and fuels had risen to almost 8:1.According to Kemp, this is a sign that oil prices may start reversing their gains before too long.Others, however, anticipate even higher prices, with JP Morgan saying this week that Brent could reach $150 per barrel. Other commodity analysts see Brent hitting $100 before this year's end.Wall Street: Watch that bond market selloff more than oilBut Wall Street’s forecasters are often too caught up in chasing a market one way that they ignore counteracting forces. And one of the bigger risks to the oil rally remains the Federal Reserve and its higher-for-long regime for U.S. interest rates.Fed Chair Powell told a news conference last week that energy-driven inflation was one of the central bank’s bigger concerns.The Fed has raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023, adding a total of 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%. It could add another quarter point in November or December and more likely in 2024.U.S. Treasury yields, benchmarked to the U.S. 10-year note, shot to fresh 16-year highs on Thursday, on expectations over Fed hikes. That bond market selloff could do the oil rally in ultimately, say analysts.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related Articles]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Comcast investors that purchase the stock on or after the 3rd of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.29 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.16 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Comcast stock has a trailing yield of around 2.6% on the current share price of $44.6. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Comcast's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Comcast is paying out an acceptable 73% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Comcast generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 41% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Comcast's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Comcast's 20% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Comcast has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.Final TakeawayIs Comcast an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Comcast from a dividend perspective.If you're not too concerned about Comcast's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Comcast and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Internet access is at the center of our modern lives and the quality of those lives will be greatly enhanced here, thanks to Comcast.”Story continues“The Central Valley continues to be a big focus for us here at Comcast as we continue to invest and expand our high speed, high-capacity network in the State,” said Regional Senior Vice President David Tashjian. “We understand that fast, reliable and secure Internet access has become a necessity for everyone, and we’re excited to be able to bring our Xfinity 10G Network to these communities to create lasting impactful change.”Through September 30, Comcast will be showcasing products and services available to customers and providing a number of raffle prizes and giveaways to attendees at the Caruthers District Fair, California’s largest and longest-running free gate fair.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Comcast (CMCSA). CMCSA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 10.94, which compares to its industry's average of 11.40. Over the last 12 months, CMCSA's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.59 and as low as 7.48, with a median of 10.22.CMCSA is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.16. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CMCSA's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.24. CMCSA's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.56, with a median of 0.81, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is CMCSA's P/B ratio of 2.19. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.24. CMCSA's P/B has been as high as 2.30 and as low as 1.44, with a median of 1.97, over the past year.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that CMCSA has a P/CF ratio of 9.10. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 9.92. Within the past 12 months, CMCSA's P/CF has been as high as 9.56 and as low as 4.82, with a median of 8.46.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Comcast is likely undervalued currently.

Cimpress (CMPR) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Consumer Discretionary peers, we might be able to answer that question.Cimpress is one of 282 individual stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #14 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Cimpress is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMPR's full-year earnings has moved 6.6% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.Our latest available data shows that CMPR has returned about 153.9% since the start of the calendar year. At the same time, Consumer Discretionary stocks have gained an average of 4.1%.

ORCL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ORCLEstablished in 1977, Oracle Corp provides database technology and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to enterprises globally. As a pioneer of the first commercial SQL-based relational database management system, Oracle now boasts 430,000 customers in 175 countries, supported by a workforce of 136,000 employees. The company's market cap stands at $289.90 billion, with sales reaching $51 billion. Considering these figures, we aim to determine whether Oracle's current stock price of $105.83 aligns with its GF Value, an estimate of its fair value.Unveiling Oracle (ORCL)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding Oracle's GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the ideal fair trading value of the stock. If the stock price significantly exceeds the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued, indicating potentially poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, suggesting higher future returns. For Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), the GF Value suggests that the stock is fairly valued at its current price of $105.83 per share.As Oracle is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth, offering a balanced investment opportunity.Story continuesUnveiling Oracle (ORCL)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Oracle's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can pose a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, it is crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Oracle's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.14, ranking worse than 89.35% of companies in the Software industry. This indicates that Oracle's overall financial strength is poor, with a rating of 4 out of 10.Unveiling Oracle (ORCL)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideOracle's Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those consistently profitable over the long term, is usually less risky. Oracle has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years, with an operating margin of 28.11%, ranking better than 94.43% of companies in the Software industry. This indicates strong profitability with a ranking of 9 out of 10.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. Oracle's 3-year average annual revenue growth is 15%, ranking better than 65.48% of companies in the Software industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 9.4%, ranking in the top 50% of the Software industry. This suggests decent growth prospects for Oracle.Comparing Oracle's ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate a company is expected to pay on average to finance its assets. When ROIC is higher than WACC, the company is creating value for shareholders. Oracle's ROIC for the past 12 months is 9.92, while its WACC stands at 10.17.Unveiling Oracle (ORCL)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Craig-Hallum upgraded WW (WW) to Hold from Sell with a price target of $10, up from $4.

The firm says DocuSign is making progress in stabilizing revenue and that it is ""incrementally positive on the new risk/reward.""HSBC upgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $69, up from $58. The stock's recent underperformance provides a good entry point to a business with exposure to decarbonization and sustainable buildings, the firm says.Piper Sandler upgraded Guardant Health (GH) to Overweight from Neutral with a $40 price target. The firm is a buyer of Guardant Health shares given recent weakness mixed with its industry data that suggests the company's position in profiling should help it sustain about 20% growth for a number of years.Evercore ISI upgraded XPO, Inc (XPO) to Outperform from In Line with a price target of $79, up from $72.

While the off-price retail space has been a ""bright spot over the past couple of quarters,"" Burlington's performance has lagged its peer group, the firm tells investors.Gordon Haskett downgraded Tractor Supply (TSCO) to Accumulate from Buy with a $215 price target.

The firm expects earnings growth to stabilize, which should be a positive catalyst for each stock, ""especially given their current historically low multiples.""Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Hasbro (HAS) with an Overweight rating and $84 price target. The firm expects upward earnings revisions as new management executes on its strategic plan to simplify Hasbro's business, cut costs, invest in innovation, and drive core topline growth. Morgan Stanley also started coverage of Mattel (MAT) with an Overweight rating and $27 price target.UBS initiated coverage of e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) with a Buy rating and $138 price target, implying 26% upside from current levels.

In fiscal Q4, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin above the midpoint of our guidance, with EPS above the high end of the range. These results reflect our strong execution, and we are well positioned to drive significant improvements in our financial performance. We believe pricing has now bottomed. Ongoing demand growth, customer inventory normalization and industry-wide supply reductions have set the stage for increased revenue along with improved pricing and profitability throughout fiscal 2024. We continue to expect record industry TAM in calendar 2025, with more normalized levels of profitability. Fiscal 2023 was a challenging year for the memory and storage industry as the revenue TAM reached a multiyear low, resulting in a significant impact to financial performance. Despite this difficult backdrop, the Micron team stayed focused on our strategy, executed well and accomplished several important milestones.We achieved record annual automotive revenue, record NAND QLC bit shipments for the full fiscal year and reached record levels in calendar Q2 for revenue share in data center and client SSDs. We were the first in our industry to introduce 1-beta DDR5 and LP5X DRAM products and the first to ship HBM3E samples with industry-leading performance and power efficiency. We were also the first to introduce 232-layer NAND SSD products in data center, client and consumer markets. These accomplishments were underpinned by our leadership technology and continued strong progress in manufacturing execution. We achieved world-class mature yields in record time on our industry-leading 1-beta, DRAM and 232-layer NAND technologies. In addition, Micron took several prudent and timely actions to reduce our CapEx and supply in order to address the market imbalances through the course of fiscal 2023. Our industry-leading technology road map continues to progress well. As we have mentioned before, the vast majority of our bits are on leading-edge nodes, 1-alpha and 1-beta in DRAM and 176-layer and 232-layer in NAND. We continue to make good progress on 1-gamma DRAM development using EUV and are on track for production in calendar 2025. Development of our next-generation NAND node is also well on track. Now turning to our end markets. Customers continue to reduce their excess inventory for memory and storage in fiscal Q4. Most customer inventories for memory and storage in the PC and smartphone markets are now at normal levels, consistent with our prior forecast. Inventory levels are normal across most customers in the automotive market as well. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize in early calendar 2024. Consequently, we see demand continuing to strengthen, which has led to an inflection in pricing. Some customers have made strategic purchases in DRAM and NAND to take advantage of unsustainably low pricing as the market begins its recovery. In data center, traditional server demand remains lackluster while demand for AI servers has been strong. Data center infrastructure operators have shifted budgets from traditional servers to higher-priced AI servers. Total server unit shipments are expected to decline in calendar 2023, the first year-over-year decline since 2016. We expect total server unit growth will resume in calendar 2024 to help fulfill ever-increasing workload demand. We also expect content growth in both, AI and traditional servers. Compared to traditional servers, AI training servers contain significantly higher DRAM and NAND content with greater technology complexity, robust product value and higher profitability. We believe our data center revenue has bottomed, and we expect growth in fiscal Q1 and increasing momentum through fiscal years '24 and '25 in our data center business. Micron has a strengthening portfolio of solutions optimized for bandwidth, capacity and power. These include HBM3E, DDR5 and associated high-capacity modules, LPDRAM and data center SSDs. This portfolio of industry-leading products positions us well to capture the opportunities presented by data-centric computing architectures and AI. The introduction of our HBM3E product offering has been met with strong customer interest and enthusiasm. Our HBM3E provides superior bandwidth, power and capacity for generative AI workloads. We developed this industry-leading design using our 1-beta technology, advanced TSV and other innovations that enable a differentiated packaging solution. We have been working closely with our customers throughout the development process and are becoming a closely integrated partner in their AI road maps. Micron HBM3E is currently in qualification for NVIDIA compute products, which will drive HBM3E-powered AI solutions. We expect to begin the production ramp of HBM3E in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5. We expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 in early calendar 2024, ahead of the industry. We expanded our high-capacity D5 DRAM module portfolio with a monolithic die-based 128-gigabyte module and have started shipping samples to customers to help support their AI application needs. We expect revenue from this product in Q2 of calendar 2024. Last month, we announced the introduction of 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte CXL 2.0 memory expansion modules. By leveraging a unique dual channel memory architecture, we are able to deliver higher module capacity and increased bandwidth. We have shipped samples to several customers and key partners. In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio utilizes 176-layer or 232-layer NAND in production, a testament to our product and technology leadership. We are well positioned to serve the growing demand for fast storage as data-intensive AI applications proliferate. We saw strong demand for our data center NVMe SSDs across our AI-focused, industry-leading 30-terabyte product as well as our mainstream products. Micron ended the second calendar quarter with a record high revenue share in data center SSDs based on independent industry assessments. We expect to build on this momentum in fiscal 2024. In PCs, we continue to forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024. AI-enabled PCs will drive content growth and an improved refresh cycle over the next 2 years. In fiscal Q4, we saw a strong sequential bit shipment growth at PC OEMs, driven by demand for LPDRAM in thin client notebooks. We expect to begin revenue shipments of our industry-leading 1-beta based client D5 in fiscal Q1 to PC OEMs. According to third-party analysts, in calendar Q2, we reached record revenue share in client SSDs for PC OEMs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our 232-layer NVMe client SSD is now qualified at large OEMs and shipping in volume production. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the second consecutive quarter with growth in both, client and consumer markets. We continue to expand our footprint in the high-end consumer SSD space, with the launch of 3 new products that extends our reach into professional content creators and enthusiast PC gamers. In mobile, we expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down by mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024. Elasticity, along with a mix shift towards premium phones with greater capacity is contributing to memory content growth. About 1/3 of smartphones sold today have at least 8 gigabytes of DRAM and 256 gigabytes of NAND, up more than 7 percentage points versus smartphone units a year ago. Similar to our view on PCs, AI-enabled mobile phones could drive content growth and a stronger refresh cycle over time. Longer term, we see generative AI applications executing on handsets. These applications will continue to drive new requirements for higher capacity, lower power and increased performance in memory and storage. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets which contribute to more stable revenue and profitability. Fiscal 2023 marked another record revenue year for our automotive business. Micron continues to lead in automotive market share in quality. Long term, we expect memory and storage content per vehicle to increase in both, ADAS and in-cabin applications. In addition, fast-growing EVs typically contain higher memory and storage content. Our automotive design win trajectory remains strong. The industrial market showed signs of recovery in fiscal Q4. Inventory levels for memory and storage are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. We expect the volume recovery that we observed in the second half of fiscal 2023 to continue into 2024. We see strong growth prospects in this market over time as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement IoT, AI and machine learning solutions. As previously discussed, the CAC or Cybersecurity Administration of China decision earlier this year has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China. We remain committed to serving our customers in China for those areas of their business, not impacted by the CAC decision. While there is near-term impact to our demand due to these challenges in China, we remain focused on maintaining Micron's global market share. Our team's grit and Micron's deep relationships with our customers, underpinned by our technology leadership, increasing product momentum, excellent product quality and extensive manufacturing and supply chain capabilities position us well towards these goals. Now turning to our market outlook, starting with demand. We expect calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. In NAND, our expectations for demand growth this calendar year have increased from high single digits to high teens percentage. These are below the expected long-term bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and low 20s percentage range in NAND. While calendar 2023 DRAM demand has been in line with expectations, NAND growth expectations have increased due to stronger-than-expected demand in certain parts of the consumer market and the trend of greater elasticity in per unit content. While macroeconomic factors remain a risk, we expect robust year-over-year bit demand growth in calendar 2024 for both, DRAM and NAND, driven by improving end market demand, normalized customer inventory levels, content growth across products and ongoing growth in AI. Calendar 2024 bit demand growth is expected to exceed the long-term CAGR for DRAM and to be near the long-term CAGR for NAND. Turning to supply. Significant supply and CapEx reductions across the industry have helped to stabilize the market and are enabling the recovery that is now underway. We see both, DRAM and NAND, year-over-year supply growth in calendar 2023 to be negative for the industry. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. In calendar 2024, we expect industry DRAM and NAND supply growth to be below industry demand growth and meaningfully so for DRAM. We believe calendar 2024 is positioned to be a year of recovery in the memory and storage industry. A sustained period of supply growth less than demand growth will strengthen the pace of recovery. HBM production will be a headwind to industry bit supply growth. Across the industry, the HBM3E die is roughly twice the size of equivalent capacity D5. The HBM product includes a logic interface die and has a substantially more complex packaging stack that impacts yields. As a result, HBM3 and 3E demand will absorb an outsized portion of industry wafer supply. The ramp of HBM3 and 3E production will reduce overall DRAM bit supply growth industry-wide, with particular supply impact on non-HBM products as more capacity is diverted to addressing HBM opportunities. Micron is experiencing a similar impact of our planned HBM3E ramp on our bit supply capability. Micron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 is planned to be well below demand growth for both, DRAM and NAND. And we expect to decrease our days of inventory in fiscal 2024. We continue to execute to our strategy of maintaining global bit shipment market share for DRAM and NAND while sustaining tight supply and CapEx management discipline. Micron's fiscal 2024 CapEx is projected to be up slightly compared to fiscal 2023 levels. WFE CapEx will be down again year-over-year in fiscal 2024. We remain focused on carefully managing overall supply growth. In last quarter's earnings call, we communicated that total wafer start reductions in both, DRAM and NAND, are approaching 30% versus peak 2022 levels. Amid an intense focus on capital efficiency over the last few quarters, we have redeployed a portion of the underutilized equipment to support production ramp of leading-edge nodes in both, DRAM and NAND. Given the higher process step count of these leading-edge nodes, transitioning this equipment results in a significant and structural reduction to our overall wafer capacity in both, DRAM and NAND. Due to the structural reduction in capacity, our DRAM and NAND wafer starts will remain significantly below 2022 levels for the foreseeable future. Our industry supply projections assume a similar structural reduction in wafer capacity industry-wide. Lead times to increase this wafer capacity will be long and will depend on improving demand, pricing and financial performance. We expect underutilization to continue in our legacy nodes well into calendar 2024. We see our demand at leading-edge nodes exceeding our supply in fiscal and calendar 2024, particularly in the second half of the year. Construction CapEx will be elevated to support our plans to build leading-edge memory fabs in Idaho and New York, for which we filed CHIPS applications in August. As we have highlighted before, the requested level of CHIPS grants for our Idaho and New York projects are essential to the viability and global competitiveness of each of these projects. Our CapEx plans assume that a certain level of CHIPS grant funds will be made available to us in fiscal year 2024. Assembly and Test CapEx is projected to double year-over-year in fiscal 2024, predominantly driven by investments to support HBM3E production. Our planned fiscal 2024 CapEx investments in HBM capacity have substantially increased versus our prior plan in response to strong customer demand for our industry-leading product. Over the course of calendar 2024, we see accelerating AI-driven opportunities for memory and storage across multiple market segments from the data center to the edge. We are encouraged by the improving industry demand and supply fundamentals. We believe that the CapEx constraints created by the industry profitability environment, coupled with improved inventories, announced supply reductions and the impact of the HBM ramp on DRAM bit supply growth will create conditions that will increasingly tighten the supply-demand balance, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year. Our Micron team is executing well and is taking prudent and proactive actions to navigate through the near-term environment and position the company to emerge stronger from the current downturn. We look forward to a recovery in our business financials taking shape in fiscal 2024. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.Mark J. MurphyThanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin higher than the midpoint of the guidance range and EPS above the high end of the range. We are exiting the fiscal year with the business improving due to multiple factors, including higher volumes and inflection in the pricing environment, strong productivity and ongoing capital discipline. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was approximately $4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down 40% year-over-year. Fiscal 2023 total revenue was $15.5 billion, down 49% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $2.8 billion, representing 69% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 3% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-teens percentage range and prices declining in the high single-digit percentage range. For the fiscal year, DRAM revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $11 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $1.2 billion, representing around 30% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 19% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing over 40%, driven by the timing of shipments, including strategic purchases and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range. For the fiscal year, NAND revenue declined 46% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, representing 27% of total revenue. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.2 billion, down 14% sequentially. Data center revenue remained weak as customers continue to adjust inventories and as a result of the CAC decision. In fiscal Q1, we expect sequential growth in data center. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.2 billion, up 48% sequentially due to seasonal effects and timing of shipments. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $860 million, down 6% sequentially. Embedded Consumer revenue increased sequentially, helped by seasonality, while automotive and industrial revenue declined modestly. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $739 million, up 18% sequentially and driven by increased shipments across most of the product portfolio. SBU bit shipments set records for fiscal Q4 and the fiscal year. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was negative 9%, improving 7 percentage points sequentially. Gross margin was impacted by lower pricing and underutilization costs while the sell-through of previously written-down inventory provided some uplift. For the fiscal year, consolidated gross margin was negative 8%, down 54 percentage points year-over-year, driven by price effects, inventory write-downs and the burden of underutilization. Approximately 6 percentage points of the reduction is from net inventory write-downs. Operating expenses in fiscal Q4 were $842 million, down $24 million sequentially due to ongoing expense reduction initiatives and the timing of certain R&amp;D program expenditures. For the fiscal year, operating expenses were $3.6 billion, down $209 million year-over-year, driven by expense reduction initiatives. On OpEx for the fourth quarter and year, we ended below the target we communicated starting with our September call a year ago. As market conditions improve, we will remain disciplined in all spending, including operating expenses, focusing R&amp;D on the most critical programs and leveraging a competitive and more productive overhead structure. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.2 billion in fiscal Q4, resulting in an operating margin of negative 30%, improved from negative 39% in the prior quarter. Fiscal 2023 operating loss was $4.8 billion, resulting in an operating margin of negative 31%. We recorded a tax benefit of $14 million in fiscal Q4, better than expectations and due primarily to lower-than-expected foreign taxes related to currency effects. For fiscal 2023, total taxes were $142 million. The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q4 was $1.07 compared to a loss per share of $1.43 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $1.45 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was a loss per share of $4.45 for the fiscal year. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $250 million in fiscal Q4. For the fiscal year, we generated $1.6 billion of cash from operations, representing 10% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $1 billion during the quarter and totaled $7 billion for the fiscal year. This was in line with recent guidance and for the year, at the low end of the range of estimates we provided on our December 2022 earnings call. Free cash flow was negative $758 million in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 ending inventory was $8.4 billion or 170 days. As mentioned last quarter, we are holding approximately $1 billion of strategic inventory stock associated with build-ahead of products for cost optimization and risk mitigation. We see days of inventory improving into the first half of the fiscal year. And adjusting for this strategic stock, expect to have only a few weeks of above-target inventories as we enter the second half of fiscal 2024. Inventory levels and profitability will remain principal factors in our decisions around wafer starts and capacity planning. Continuing with the balance sheet, we maintained historically high levels of liquidity. At year-end, we held $10.5 billion of cash and investments and had $13 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. We ended the year with $13.3 billion in total debt, a weighted average maturity of 2030 on debt and low net leverage. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter. Demand is improving as customer inventory levels continue to normalize, and secular growth drivers remain intact. We expect record DRAM bit shipments in fiscal Q1. For NAND, we expect fiscal Q1 bit shipments to decline somewhat from fiscal Q4 levels but remained relatively strong. In China, the Cyberspace Administration of China decision continues to impact our revenue opportunity, and the associated headwinds is reflected in our guidance. Fiscal Q1 gross margin is projected to improve sequentially on a greater mix of DRAM and more sell-through of written down inventories. We expect approximately 60% of the remaining benefit from lower cost inventories to clear in fiscal Q1. Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate any additional inventory write-downs due to pricing. Period costs associated with underutilization will weigh on gross margins in the quarter as first quarter period costs are projected to be similar to the prior quarter. Beyond fiscal Q1, we project gross margin improvement to continue as prices increase and period costs become less of a factor. We expect the rate of price improvement in the second fiscal half to exceed the first half. We now forecast gross margins to be positive throughout the second half of fiscal 2024. As mentioned last quarter, we expect fiscal Q1 operating expenses to increase sequentially, driven by an increase in R&amp;D and as temporary reductions to employee compensation come to an end. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect operating expenses to be up by a low single-digit percentage versus fiscal 2023. On taxes, we project a material, sequential quarterly increase as we move from a credit in Q4 to a more normal expense. As discussed previously, the overall profitability remains low, a minimum level of taxes will occur based primarily on local jurisdiction profit. As we are forecasting a consolidated pretax loss in fiscal 2024, these local factors will drive tax expense again this year. We estimate our full year fiscal 2024 taxes to be under $200 million. Our first quarter tax estimate of $80 million reflects our forecasted Q1 results in proportion to full year projected tax expense. Changes in the distribution of profit within the year may result in changes in the tax expense recognized each quarter. We project our fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to increase slightly versus fiscal 2023 as we balance the long-term capacity needs of the business with ongoing capital discipline and near-term cash flow objectives. Consistent with our comments in the last few quarters, we do see WFE CapEx decreasing from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024. When factoring higher construction spend and expected grants in fiscal 2024, we forecast our CapEx to be more evenly distributed over fiscal 2024. A sequential increase in quarterly CapEx, together with improving but still challenging profitability levels in the near term, means free cash flow will remain significantly negative in the first half of the fiscal year. We forecast improved free cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year. We project our balance sheet to remain strong and net leverage ratio to peak in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. To support the long-term investment priorities of the business, we have ample liquidity and ready access to multiple sources of credit. We will continue to manage our business to maintain financial flexibility and in a manner, consistent with our commitment to our investment-grade rating. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 4%, plus or minus 200 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expense of approximately $80 million.Based on the share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2023 despite facing a historic downturn. We sustained our technology, product and manufacturing leadership and achieved mature yields in record time on the industry's most advanced nodes in DRAM and NAND. Micron's leading product announcements position us well to address the growing performance requirements of data-centric computing. In response to severe market conditions, we acted quickly and decisively to cut supply and capital spend to reduce operating costs and improve productivity and to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet. As the business improves in fiscal 2024, we will leverage our strengths in technology, product and manufacturing, while maintaining the productivity and capital discipline that we displayed in fiscal 2023. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.Sanjay MehrotraThank you, Mark. The past 4 quarters tested the resilience and agility of our entire industry. While the recovery from this downturn has begun, Micron will exercise continued supply discipline to drive a return to sustained profitability. I'm proud of our team's response to adversity, sustaining our technology leadership, improving time to mature yield and launching a suite of leading-edge products that represent one of the strongest portfolio expansions in Micron's 45-year history. As our global investment announcements throughout the year clearly show, Micron remains keenly focused on building our business to meet future demand driven by the proliferation of AI from the data center to the edge. I have full confidence in our team, the position we have built for Micron and our collective ability to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question for today comes from the line of Tom O'Malley from Barclays.Thomas James O'MalleyI just want to understand the trajectory here on the NAND business. You guys, in the quarter, kind of took your demand profile from high-single digits to high teens, and you pointed out consumer in particular. What can you do to give us confidence that, that wasn't a pull-in from some of your large consumer customers and that later this year, there might be a little hole there? And just talk about the trajectory of where you see that business going, just given you said that bits are going to be down sequentially into November.Sanjay MehrotraSo with respect to NAND, yes, I mean, compared to what we have said before, we saw a strong demand, particularly on the consumer, including some parts of the channel. And the consumer part included likes of smartphones, PCs, et cetera. And again, as I pointed out, the channel as well. And keep in mind, with the pricing that has existed for NAND, elasticity has certainly kicked in. The content is continuing to increase in the devices. Today's flagship smartphones have minimum of 8 gigabyte DRAM and 128 gigabyte of NAND. So that's the overall trend. And same thing in PCs that the elasticity is driving increasing average capacities. And overall, certainly -- strategic buyers, they have influenced some of the NAND demand for the year as well. And keep in mind that next year, in 2024, we see that the demand growth will be pretty much close to the long-term CAGR for the NAND. And the strat buyers -- the strategic buyers that I mentioned, of course, they help improve the inventory position for NAND as well. So overall, of course, supply cuts have been made in NAND as well. And as we look ahead, we do see that the demand and supply fundamentals will continue to improve on the NAND side as well. And the inflection in pricing as well has occurred. And particularly in the second half of our fiscal year, we would see that continued improvement in the pricing as well.Thomas James O'MalleyHelpful. And then just as a follow-up, Obviously, you're facing headwinds from CAC [band.] Can you just talk about areas of the market where you guys are targeting to help make up some of those bits? Is it just conversations with customers in the consumer space, or are you looking at content increases in the data center? Just given the puts and takes of where you're making up that double-digit percentage hole. And if you see kind of any change to that? Is it getting worse, or is it getting better into February and May of this year?Sanjay MehrotraSo as we have mentioned before, the CAC headwinds are primarily in the data center and networking markets for us in China. And the impact -- the negative impact of revenue as a result of CAC decision is already baked in, in our CQ4 [results] and is also included in our CQ1 -- FQ1 guidance here. And keep in mind that the CAC decision, I mean, continues to remain a risk for our business and the impact in our China demand is meaningful. However, Micron has made strong progress with respect to mitigating the effects as well with our global customers who are not impacted by the CAC decision. And we are mitigating that and effect of the mitigation also is reflected in our FQ4 results as well as in FQ1 guidance. So the Q4 results and Q1 guidance reflect the net effect of the loss of revenue in China as well as the success with some of the mitigation. And of course, we are working on mitigating the China revenue loss with increases in demand for us across our multiple end markets across all our global end markets. And remember that our goal remains to maintain our global share. While there may be some ebbs and flows in the near term, but our goal absolutely remains to maintain our global market share here in terms of bits.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.Toshiya HariI had a gross margin question for you, Mark. You're guiding November quarter up 5 percentage points sequentially. I was hoping you could provide a bridge, if you will, on a sequential basis. You talked a little bit about period cost continuing to be a headwind. You gave a little bit of color for the benefit you'll see from selling through written down inventory, but what are your thoughts on pricing, what are your thoughts on cost downs? And if you can give directional guidance for Feb and the puts and takes there, that would be helpful as well.Mark J. MurphySure, Toshiya. So on the fourth to first quarter bridge, as you mentioned, we are forecasting roughly a 500-basis point improvement. We did say over the last few quarters that this would be the profile of our improvement. I will say that it's gotten incrementally better in that we said before that our profile would be that we would be positive gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24. We now believe we'll be positive gross margin through fiscal '24, and so you'll see this positive margin trend continuing. As it relates to the first quarter, we do get a small benefit, roughly 1 point of incremental low-cost inventory pass-through from what passes through in the first quarter, which will be around $600 million versus what we had pass-through in the fourth quarter, which was roughly $550 million. We also will see a slight benefit in price in the first quarter. As we've mentioned in the last several quarters, we first saw pockets of improvement. And then we mentioned that price was bottoming. We're mentioning on this call that it has bottomed, and we are seeing in the first quarter price improvement. And we expect that in this transition period to be somewhat muted in the first half and then pick up momentum and strengthen considerably in the second half. So that's the general walk for the first quarter. I will -- because there's a lot of puts and takes, maybe just -- it's been a very difficult several quarters around both utilization write-downs. And fortunately, we're on the other side of that, which we can cover later in this call or the after call.Toshiya HariAnd then maybe as a quick follow-up on HBM for Sanjay. 3 months ago, you guys talked about or at least hinted that in fiscal '24, you might be able to generate several hundred million dollars in revenue. Is that sort of target still intact? Have things improved since then? And I guess, at what point do you expect your presence in HBM to be similar to your presence in DRAM overall?Sanjay MehrotraWe are very excited with our HBM product. It is an industry-leading product with respect to performance, power, capacity, capability. And as we have mentioned, this product is in the qualification stages with our customers here, and we expect revenue to begin in early 2024. And yes, we are very much still on track for meaningful revenue, several hundred million dollars in our fiscal year '24. So pleased with the progress, continuing to make good progress. It is an exciting opportunity for the memory industry. And Micron will be well positioned to capture the generative AI opportunities that require the kind of attributes that our HBM3E memory brings to the market.And of course, as we proceed through the fiscal year, we expect to be gaining share in this important part of the -- in this important high-growth part of the memory market.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.Timothy Michael ArcuriMark, I wanted to clarify the statement on gross margins. So you had said in the prepared remarks that it would be positive in the back half of the fiscal year. But in response to the question just before, you said that it will be positive through fiscal '24. So since you're guiding negative in fiscal Q1, does that tell us that fiscal Q2 gross margin will be positive?Mark J. MurphyGood question, Tim. I didn't comment on fiscal Q2. Fiscal Q3, we believe, will be positive. And there'll be a trend of improving gross margin fiscal Q1 through fiscal Q3.Timothy Michael ArcuriOkay. So you don't want to state that fiscal Q2 will be positive. Maybe it will be, maybe it won't be.Mark J. MurphyIt may be. It depends on, of course, pricing. And we're continuing to drive productivity, and we'll just have to see it. These profitability levels, mix and other things matter. I mean we do have favorable mix of DRAM going into the first half. We're increasing DRAM relative to NAND in the first half of the year, so that helps. Pricing, the momentum is definitively positive. It's just a case of we're in a transition period. We did see -- we kind of had to meet the market on some special deals here in the fourth quarter, and yes, those effects will continue in the first half. But we're definitely seeing new deals being struck at higher prices, and we certainly expect that to strengthen in the second half.Timothy Michael ArcuriGot it. And then as follow-up, just on that comment you just made about ""special deals"" that you struck in fiscal Q4. NAND demand, you're more positive on NAND demand, but pricing was still as bad, if not worse, than at least I thought it would have been inside of fiscal Q4. So is -- can you kind of [foot] that? Is that maybe you offering some big deals on the NAND side, some customers coming in and being opportunistic and you offering some big deals to move bits and maybe shore up your NAND share but at the expensive price? Can you just walk through that for us?Mark J. MurphyYes. I would say, Tim, that really NAND pricing was not -- was basically in line with the downs that we saw in the third quarter. So I would say that prices -- the decrease had slowed and that the price -- or the market was beginning to firm up. Customers realize that this is a period that's ending, the market is firming up. And so there's also some mix effects in there. We do see price and NAND improving in the first quarter. It will be up actually in the first quarter. And so I think that's all, I'd say, on price for NAND.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group.Mehdi HosseiniYes. Two follow-ups. I would like to better understand the dynamics of seasonality. You talked about the NAND-based shipment declining in the Q1 fiscal year and most of the growth coming from DRAM. But how should we think about seasonality impact in February quarter? And I have a follow-up.Sanjay MehrotraSo certainly, the typical seasonality will be in place. But just keep in mind that at Q4, we had a very strong sequential bit growth in the NAND business. And I mean, coming off that big sequential growth, we are just guiding to normalized level of overall shipments as part of FQ1. And overall, again, the content continues to increase across the end market applications, and that will continue to drive increased demand growth for us as well.Mehdi HosseiniSo would there be seasonality in February quarter?Sanjay MehrotraWell, typical seasonality trends that exist in the consumer market would be there, but keep in mind that it all depends on the mix of the business as well for us. In terms of NAND, we have already guided to the trends. But overall, when we look at the full year basis, we would look at that calendar year '24, NAND will be growing in line with the long-term CAGR or near the long-term CAGR. And DRAM will be growing in terms of demand, much ahead of the long-term CAGR as well. And all of that will, of course, take into account the typical seasonality that occurs in the industry.Mehdi HosseiniGreat. And second question has to do with the puts and takes in reducing wafer starts. And I understand that more emphasis is on the trailing edge. But as I think about memory, like there is no trailing edge. And in that context, as you think about bringing utilization rate back up to the normal level then some of the trailing edge converted to the leading edge. Could that help with a bigger step-up in gross margin improvement? How should we think about it, assuming that the trailing edge would be phased out?Sanjay MehrotraWell, good question. And I think I would like to take the opportunity to provide some context here and overall background. As you know that in 2023, the industry has experienced extreme oversupply and extreme negative effect on the profitability as well. And you see now that CapEx cuts and underutilization in the fab have been implemented across the industry, given the CapEx constraints that we have as well as given the poor profitability. And certainly, Micron has done that, but this is happening across the industry as well. And at the same time, the demand for the new products is increasing that require as you were pointing out, leading-edge technology as well. And in order to maintain our supply discipline, and to meet the demand for these new products such as HBM such as GDDR5. We are shifting some of our equipment from older nodes into the newer technologies to ramp up those newer technologies into production. In the past, we would have done this with more CapEx, but we are being extremely mindful of CapEx spend, extremely disciplined about supply. So as a result, when we move the equipment from older nodes to support the ramp-up of leading-edge nodes, it results in a net reduction in overall -- in a net reduction in the structural reduction in the wafer capacity as well. And that overall bodes well for the industry demand-supply fundamentals. So keep in mind that as we go through the year and as we shift more of the equipment toward ramp-up of leading-edge nodes, this will result in overall wafer capacity reduction and lowering underutilization as well. Of course, the legacy nodes will continue to have underutilization through the course of the year. And these are all helpful factors in terms of the demand/supply balance in the industry. And some of the phenomena that we have described regarding structural wafer capacity reduction, this is not unique to Micron. We believe this is happening with other suppliers as well as they grapple with the same supply, profitability and CapEx considerations as we are addressing. So the reduction in wafer capacity is actually the headwind in supply growth. And this you know that increasing wafer capacity has a high bar for ROI -- CapEx investments, it has a high bar in terms of ROI. And of course, it would require longer lead time as well given the new equipment that would be required. So structural reduction in wafer capacity is overall good, coupled with the underutilization in the legacy nodes. And as we pointed out, the new products in the leading-edge nodes also do require more wafer capacity for the same gigabits of production, given the nature of like HBM, that where the die size is twice as big. So these new products also actually have a favorable impact on the industry supply growth capability. And these trends of supply growth with respect to structural wafer capacity reduction and the new products that end up requiring more new wafer capacity are extremely important. It factors in terms of really understanding the improving, strengthening demand supply fundamentals as we look at our fiscal year '24 and calendar year 2024.OperatorThank you, and this does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.]"

BrandsOriginally Published on the Taco Bell Blog""Before the war in Ukraine, life was so good, everything was fine. Then, it changed.""Alex Murza grew up in Kyiv, Ukraine where he spent his whole life. He received his MBA at Ukraine's International Academy of Personal Management and graduated with his law degree from University of Ukraine. Back home, he was an attorney with a background in real-estate. While getting his degree, Alex also gained some experience working at a local restaurant. However, when the war hit Ukraine, Alex had to change his course like many others. He started volunteering to support those around him.""I volunteered to help refugees and those in need of necessities. I brought materials and food for refugees and helped them connect with their family.""After five months of volunteering, Alex decided to move his family to the United States in hopes of a better life.""It was different starting with nothing. The first month was very hard. I had no money, no home. Back in Ukraine, if you rent a house, it came with furniture. Here in the U.S., it came empty.""While trying to make ends meet and searching for a job, Alex came across Taco Bell. He applied for a position at a local corporate restaurant and was promptly hired. Bringing some of his restaurant experience from Ukraine to Taco Bell, Alex started working with his General Manager Jess and Area Coach Charlie James to learn more about the quick service restaurant space.""When I first started, Charlie and Jess helped me a lot with work, giving me advice on how to do better. With their help, and my team, I have also been learning English. It's hard to communicate and understand because people talk fast and in slang. I am new to this country, but Taco Bell gave me opportunity because they have helpful ways to adapt when needed.""Amongst a foreign language and country, Alex has been exposed to new food for the first time as well. His favorite item at Taco Bell is the Breakfast Crunchwrap because he's never had something like that before. His son is an even bigger fan of Doritos® Locos Tacos!Story continuesWhen Alex isn't working at the restaurant, he's spending his weekends enhancing his education in a new line of work. He is currently a culinary student following his passion of becoming a chef and opening his own restaurant. He recently received a $5.1k scholarship from the International Culinary Arts and Sciences Institute (ICASI) to pursue his dreams.""I lost everything and started life from new. That's why I changed my career to a chef. I cannot use Ukrainian degree here, and if I start law in U.S., it's from the beginning and very different. Now, I follow my passion to cook, and my favorite thing to make is bread.""If Alex can share one thing he's learned in the past year, it's to just keep moving forward no matter how tough the times get.""Be strong and never give up. If you have dreams, do everything to make the dreams happen and everything will be fine. This country has opportunity, but you need to work hard, have a growth mindset, take risks and continue learning something new.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend Aristocrats are a select group of publicly traded companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. These companies are mainly known for their financial stability and the ability to generate consistent cash flows, which allows them to sustain and grow their dividend payments even during economic downturns. While dividend stocks haven't performed as well as the overall market this year, their attractiveness and advantages are pulling investors back toward them. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has gained 0.04% this year so far and its 12-month returns came in at 9.27%, as of September 25.One of the main reasons for the growing appeal of dividend stocks is the power of compounding. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividends have played a vital role in the profits investors have made over the past 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total gains in the S&amp;P 500 Index can be traced back to the practice of reinvesting dividends and the power of compounding. The report also mentioned that between 1930 and 2022, dividend income typically made up 41% of the total return from the S&amp;P 500 Index.Dividend stocks are mainly defensive. Despite everything that has occurred this year, such as the regional banking issues, it's important not to overlook how well the Aristocrats performed last year. They had a negative return of 6.5%, which was much better than the S&amp;P 500's negative return of 18%. Furthermore, the Aristocrats also offered some protection from the bond market's significant losses in various asset categories. In 2022, when investors were concerned about the stock valuations, high dividend funds did well because they offered attractive yields to income-seeking investors.Story continuesAlso Read: S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Analyst RatingsSimeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, spoke to Barron’s about the benefits of dividend aristocrat stocks, which include their history of raising dividends, financial stability, and solid cash generation. He also highlighted that in the second quarter, while earnings for companies in the S&amp;P 500 decreased by nearly 6% compared to the previous year, the Aristocrats saw an average earnings increase of about 10%, according to Bloomberg data. Here are some remarks from the analyst:“The ability [of the Aristocrats] to grow those earnings in an earnings recession and the ability to crank that out without using a lot of capital is the tangible benefit of quality.”Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

Similarly, the Dow and the Nasdaq finished at their lowest levels since Jul 10 and Jun 7, respectively.The possibility of a partial government shutdown has been stoking fears among investors. If Congress is not able to strike a deal on a dozen spending bills by the end of this week, the U.S. government is likely to get shut down.Scores of government workers won't get their paychecks, thereby injecting a fresh doze of uncertainty into the economy. By the way, traditionally, the stock market saw a lot of volatility in the days leading up to the government shutdown.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s intention to hold interest rates high is also weighing on stocks. This is because an increase in interest rates decreases the present value of a company’s future earnings.Also, the cost of borrowing rises and consumer outlays decrease as interest rates increase, which doesn’t bode well for economic growth.In its recently concluded policy meeting, the Fed said it intends to hike rates by another 25 basis points by the end of this year to curb elevated inflation, which is still hovering way above the central bank’s target of 2%. The Fed has also hinted at keeping interest rates higher for longer in 2024 (read more: Fed Anticipates Higher Rates for Longer: 5 Big Winners).Thus, with the government shutdown and rate hike concerns looming and the stock market subjected to bouts of volatility, it’s prudent for investors to place bets on dividend aristocrats like Caterpillar CAT, Abbott Laboratories ABT, McDonald's MCD, Aflac AFL and Automatic Data Processing ADP for steady income.

Moghadam and The Home Depot Chair, President and CEO Ted Decker kicked off the day with a conversation focused how AI is impacting industry, particularly the global supply chain.""I think AI is a big, fast-moving train. You better get on it or you're going to get run over by it,"" said Moghadam. ""But before you can engage with AI and get value out of it, you have to have data and you have to have data digitized.""Decker agreed, saying: ""Every company has to be a technology company, a data company and increasingly a data science company.""The Home Depot CEO reflected on how AI is helping their company adjust their consumer strategy: ""We've always been an anonymous mass retailer. What we are increasingly being known for is that we will be mass personalization.""Data Impacts HR StrategyThe need for innovation and ways to develop and upskill talent for sustainable career paths has never been greater – and data is a difference maker. That was the shared perspective of Alison Caplan, chief people officer for CBRE; Aaron Demerson, commissioner, Texas Workforce Commission; Christina Hall, Instacart's CHRO and Scott Marshall, Prologis' chief customer officer, in a discussion about the expectations employers are facing in a post-pandemic labor market.""We've done a lot of work around understanding the employee experience. Where do our employees value what we do? How do we pull those levers and give them more of those own experiences? Where are the experiences that we need to improve?"" asked Caplan. ""By really shoring up that employee experience, you're going to ultimately have higher engagement, lower turnover.""Story continuesThe Shift Toward Clean EnergyA panel of experts explored how quickly companies are evolving their mobility strategies – and the challenges they are facing. In a conversation moderated by FreightWaves Founder and CEO Craig Fuller, Stella Li, EVP at BYD Company Ltd. and CEO, BYD Americas; Dave Merrill, co-founder and CEO, Elroy Aviation; and Laura Renger, executive director at California Electric Transportation Coalition, discussed where change is happening and how quickly.Li said, ""We think the first area is last mile logistics; all the light-duty and even heavy-duty trucks that operate at a port can be electrified very quickly in next maybe three to five years.""Prologis' Chief Energy and Sustainability Officer Susan Uthayakumar spoke with Martin Adams, general manager and chief engineer at Los Angeles Department of Water and Power; Alice Jackson, senior vice president of System Strategy and chief planning officer at Xcel Energy; and Carla Peterman, executive vice president, corporate affairs and chief sustainability officer at PG&amp;E about how their organizations are pivoting to cleaner, more efficient energy solutions and sources.""Power has to match demand. When you have variable inputs coming in, it's a challenge,"" said Adams. ""We're making our grid a lot smarter than it used to be, and we're investing in the smart grid to use better intelligence and invest in a smarter system.""""Will ChatGPT take my job?""Brad Stone, author and senior executive editor Bloomberg Technology, explored how AI is impacting all aspects of the global economy with Azita Martin, vice president and general manager of AI for Retail, CPG and QSR, NVIDIA and Warren Packard, operating partner at AI Fund.""I think the best way I would describe AI is that AI is your assistant. In fact, someone asked the question, 'Will ChatGPT take my job?' No, but someone using ChatGPT will take your job,"" said Martin. ""That's really important because AI can crunch a lot of data and give you a lot of information that would take several people and weeks to put together.""Packard commented on how sector expertise will matter: ""Supply chain is one of these verticals where it requires subject matter expertise. It's not going to be OpenAI, it's not going to be Anthropic, it's not going to be Microsoft or Amazon who come out and innovate in those spaces. They're going to help…but it's going to be the entrepreneurs who understand those verticals that are able to create these really game-changing companies in these different verticals.""Early-Stage InnovationPrologis' Chief Technology Officer Sineesh Keshav interviewed several Prologis Ventures partners: Kyle Bernhardt, chief product officer, TestFit; Gina Chung, vice president, Corporate Development, Locus Robotics; Layla Shaikley, Wise Systems co-founder and head of product; and Evan Smith, Altana Technologies co-founder and CEO. Each of these companies has an innovative solution that is actively impacting the logistics industry.""In our largest installations, we have over 700 robots operating, picking orders every single day, every single minute. We wouldn't be able to do that without AI,"" said Chung of her company's robots. ""The biggest benefit that we provide to our customers is this lift in productivity.""Hundreds gathered in-person, and thousands virtually, for the forum, which included additional LinkedIn Live half-time and post-show commentary.

571,41a3615b-c815-3b34-bac4-8332c6ec1752,PLD,2023-09-28,Prologis chief urges Federal Reserve to rethink rate policy,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prologis-chief-urges-federal-rethink-202859869.html,1695846539,STORY,"['PLD', 'HD']","[Hamid Moghadam warns the Fed about getting ""too carried away."" (Photo: Prologis)The head of Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD), the world’s largest logistics real estate company, urged the Federal Reserve Wednesday to throttle back on its aggressive policy of interest rate increases and the hawkish rhetoric supporting it, warning that the Fed’s actions may “spook this market into places that they don’t want to go.”Hamid R. Moghadam, co-founder, chairman and CEO, was not specific about what market he was referring to. Co-keynoting his company’s annual Groundbreakers event in San Francisco, Moghadam said the Fed is “getting a little carried away” with rate increases and with “the language that they’re using” to justify its policies.Since March 2022, the Fed has hiked the federal funds rate — the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans — by 525 basis points from a range of 0% to 0.5% to current levels of 5.5%. The most aggressive rate-tightening policy in 40 years has been designed to bring down the rate of inflation, which in June 2022 hit its highest level since the early 1980s but has since come down considerably to the low 3% range. Fed Chairman Jerome H. Powell has set a goal of 2% inflation and has pledged to keep rates higher for longer until the Fed sees a sustainable move down toward that level.The rapid pace of increases has led to calls for the Fed to pause and let the higher borrowing costs work their way through the economy. Rate adjustments typically have a lag effect, and the concern is that all of the Fed’s hikes have not yet been fully felt throughout the economy.The Fed’s actions have raised borrowing costs for all aspects of commerce, notably commercial real estate. Activity in the industrial sector, which is considered a subset of commercial real estate and is dominated by logistics warehousing, has slowed in 2023 as higher rates have made deals less attractive. Some tenants have also pulled back from the market due to a softening of overall demand that has lessened the need for warehouse capacity.Story continuesHowever, demand from third-party logistics providers and e-commerce retailers continues to prop up the market, and few expect both sectors to reduce their appetite for warehouse space.Moghadam expects 2024 to be a good year for Prologis because current rents in its portfolio are substantially lower than markets, giving the company an opportunity to play catch-up on new deals and renewals. The spread between Prologis’ and market rents provides an opportunity for the company to grow substantially for at least a decade, he said.Profits will be reinvested to build out Prologis’ growing array of services that extend beyond traditional real estate and to effectively reposition it as a “logistics solutions company,” Moghadam said. Most of the company’s 2024 growth will be organic rather than through acquisition, said Moghadam. The company has a global network of more than 1 billion square feet, and manages the equivalent of 3% of global GDP that moves through its buildings.Moghadam shared the keynote with Ted Decker, chairman, president and CEO of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) and one of Prologis’ largest tenants. Both executives said global supply chains appear to have normalized following the pandemic-related dislocations in 2020, 2021 and part of 2022. However, both said that global networks are one devastating event away from again blowing up and causing disruptions in the flow of goods.Moghadam said those concerns will incentivize businesses to invest more in buffer stock and the facilities to hold it. Businesses will rather invest more in restocking than run the risk of widespread inventory stockouts in the event of another crisis, he said.Both companies are committed to expanding their use of AI. Prologis will focus its power on helping the company make better decisions regarding leasing and the deployment of capital. Moghadam said. Home Depot will use it to optimize inventory replenishment and mass personalization, which mines data to dig into customer preferences, Decker said.The post Prologis chief urges Federal Reserve to rethink rate policy appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Total hard disk drive revenue declined 14% sequentially to $1.4 billion, primarily due to softer demand in the cloud nearline market. However, there was an improvement in the VIA business. Mass capacity shipments also declined, reflecting the expected slowdown in the cloud business.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with STX. Click here to check it out. STX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of STXSo why did Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio) from The Baupost Group double his holdings in Seagate Technology, increasing its weight in his equity portfolio from 0.28% to 0.51%?Seagate and AIGenerative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence, is gaining significant attention and is expected to be a major driver of long-term growth in the technology industry. AI requires compute power and data to function. Companies like Seagate are closely monitoring the developments in generative AI and its implications for storage demand and stand to profit from the increased demand in data storage needs.Long-term growth drivers in generative AIDave Mosley, the CEO of Seagate Technology, discussed the potential impact of generative AI on the demand for both hard disk drives and solid-state drives. He highlighted that data center infrastructure, including new data center build-outs and power infrastructure, is currently a priority for cloud service providers and organizations utilizing AI technologies.Mosley emphasized that as AI technologies continue to advance and find applications in various industries, the need for data to feed these AI engines will increase significantly. He referred to this as a ""bow wave"" that will create a surge in demand for mass capacity infrastructure. This surge in demand is expected to be a net positive for companies like Seagate, which specialize in storage solutions.Story continuesWhen asked about the timeline for storage demand uplift as data creation accelerates, Mosley acknowledged there are aging drives in data centers that will eventually need to be replaced. While unit shipments of drives may decrease, the overall storage capacity (exabytes) can still increase due to the higher capacity of newer drives. He expressed confidence that unit shipments will rebound as cloud service providers continue to invest in infrastructure and AI capabilities.The growth of generative AI and its impact on storage demand is expected to be a long-term trend. As new AI applications emerge and cloud service providers compete to harness the power of AI, the need for robust storage solutions will continue to grow. Companies like Seagate are well-positioned to benefit from this trend, as they provide the necessary storage infrastructure to support the increasing data requirements of generative AI.Higher capacity, higher profitsIn the world of data storage, the demand for higher capacity drives is constantly growing. As businesses and individuals generate and store more data than ever before, storage solutions need to keep up with this increasing demand. Two technologies that are playing a crucial role in meeting this demand are perpendicular magnetic recording and heat-assisted magnetic recording.PMR has been the dominant technology in hard disk drives for many years. It works by aligning the magnetic particles on the disk surface vertically, allowing for higher data density. However, as data storage requirements continue to rise, PMR has reached its limits in terms of capacity. To address this, storage companies have been working on developing new technologies, such as HAMR.HAMR is a breakthrough technology that enables even higher data densities in hard disk drives. It works by using a laser to heat a tiny spot on the disk surface, allowing for more precise magnetic recording. This technology allows for significantly higher storage capacities, making it a promising solution for the future.Seagate, one of the leading storage companies, has been actively working on both PMR and HAMR technologies to meet the increasing demand for higher capacity drives.Seagate's PMR and HAMR technologiesMosley mentioned that Seagate has been working on PMR variants that can achieve capacities in the mid-20s terabytes. However, the company believes that with shingled magnetic recording variants, they can achieve capacities in the high-20s terabytes. SMR is a technology that allows for overlapping tracks on the disk, further increasing data density.The transition from PMR to HAMR is a planned and strategic move for Seagate. The company has been developing a platform that can support both PMR and HAMR technologies, allowing for a smooth transition. Mosley expressed confidence in the technology and mentioned that Seagate is ready to produce 40 terabyte drives in the not-too-distant future.It is important to note the development of these technologies is not solely focused on increasing capacity. Mosley highlighted other technology vectors are also being worked on to improve overall performance and efficiency. Additionally, HAMR can also utilize SMR technology, providing even more flexibility in terms of capacity options.Seagate's focus on meeting customer needs and providing competitive products in the market was also emphasized. Mosley mentioned the company is cautious about forcing products into the market if there is no immediate demand, as it could potentially erode the value proposition for future products. This approach ensures the company can deliver the right solutions at the right time, maximizing customer satisfaction and market potential.In terms of financial implications, Mosley mentioned the cost per terabyte can vary depending on factory utilization and market conditions. However, Seagate's product roadmap includes new PMR and HAMR products that will help reduce the cost per terabyte, ensuring competitiveness in the market.ConclusionGenerative AI is poised to be a significant driver of long-term growth in the technology industry. The increasing demand for data center infrastructure and the need for mass capacity storage to feed AI engines present opportunities for companies specializing in storage solutions. As the AI landscape evolves and new applications emerge, the importance of efficient data tiering infrastructure and advanced storage technologies will become even more critical.The development of PMR and HAMR technologies is crucial in meeting the increasing demand for higher capacity drives. Seagate Technology's focus on these technologies and their strategic approach to product development positions it well to address the evolving needs of the data storage market. As businesses and individuals continue to generate and store more data, the advancements in PMR and HAMR technologies will play a vital role in enabling efficient and cost-effective storage solutions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

576,7fbac3e2-5135-3ee8-b219-b970a8897151,RHI,2023-09-28,Is Weakness In Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-robert-half-inc-nyse-101222089.html,1695809542,STORY,['RHI'],"[Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) has had a rough month with its share price down 4.5%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Robert Half's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Robert Half How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Robert Half is:33% = US$542m ÷ US$1.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Robert Half's Earnings Growth And 33% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Robert Half has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 15% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 12% net income growth seen by Robert Half over the past five years.We then performed a comparison between Robert Half's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 13% in the same 5-year period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is RHI worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether RHI is currently mispriced by the market.Is Robert Half Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 31% (implying that the company retains 69% of its profits), it seems that Robert Half is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Robert Half is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 35%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 35%.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Robert Half's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

ROWE PRICE PUBLISHES NEW STUDY SHOWING THAT 401(k) LOANS ARE ON THE RISE AND EMERGENCY SAVINGS ARE LOW AMID INFLATION IN FIRST HALF 2023,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-publishes-study-143600395.html,1695738960,STORY,['TROW'],"[New report also shows low exchange activity, especially among target date investorsBALTIMORE, Sept. 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- T. Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, has published a report detailing plan sponsors' and participants' reactions to continued inflation and economic challenges in the first two quarters of 2023. The report examines retirement behavioral trends and correlations between the challenging economy with rates of savings for retirement.401(k) loans are on the rise and have consistently increased since a low in 2020, but have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. Loans decreased at the beginning of the pandemic, due in part to the special COVID-related distributions. While the current percentage of participants taking loans increased in all age groups, average loan amounts decreased from 2022 to 2023 among all age groups except participants aged 50–59, who also hold the highest loan balances. Participants who take loans or hardship withdrawals are less likely to use the auto-increase service, which automatically increases deferral rates each year.The study found that most participants are not financially prepared for an emergency, with 70% of participants reporting that they have not saved six months' worth of expenses for an emergency. Further, 46% say that they have less than $1,000 saved for unexpected expenses. Participants cited rising credit card debt, mortgage payments, and car payments as the top three reasons for an inability to save.Despite continued inflation in the first half of 2023, participants mostly held their ground with an average deferral rate of 8.5%. The exchange rate has remained relatively stable since 2018, except during the period of market volatility in 2020. Participants who invest 100% in target date investments continue to have the lowest average exchange rate compared with participants who invest partially or not at all in a target date product. The highest exchange activity has been by participants who do not invest in target date products.Story continuesThe report also found improved participant engagement driven by personalized communications. Participants have consumed a greater amount of digital retirement planning and savings content so far in 2023, specifically educational videos around financial wellness. These popular programs focused on budgeting, retirement readiness, and maximizing 401(k) plans.Key Highlights:Participants were 24 times more likely to stay the course when invested 100% in a target date product.Participants were two times less likely to opt-in to auto-increases when taking a loan or a hardship.Less than 13% of participants start making catch-up contributions when they're eligible at age 50.Participants were five times more likely to seek additional resources and two times more likely to increase their deferral rate after watching a personalized educational video.""While we are encouraged to see participants continuing to maintain savings levels and take advantage of personalized education, people need help addressing debt, emergencies, and overall financial health"" said Rachel Weker, senior retirement strategist for Retirement Plan Services at T. Rowe Price. ""Participants need more education to continue improving financial health by balancing competing priorities, like debt and emergencies, with retirement savings.""To view highlights of the report, click here.ABOUT THE REPORT The Q2 Reactions Report was published by T.

Rowe Price Group Inc's (NASDAQ:TROW) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with TROW. Click here to check it out. TROW 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TROWAs of 2023-09-25, T. Rowe Price Group Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $121.90. It's currently trading at a price of $105.44. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 13.5%. The company is modestly undervalued.Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of T. Rowe Price Group IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. T. Rowe Price Group Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$6.71GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.5%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 11.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=70.17Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=51.73Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=121.90Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $133.01. This valuation indicates that the T. Rowe Price Group Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 20.73%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NYSE:UPS) At US$152?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-united-parcel-inc-nyse-110048936.html,1695898848,STORY,['UPS'],"[Let's talk about the popular United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$188 and falling to the lows of US$152. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether United Parcel Service's current trading price of US$152 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at United Parcel Service’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What Is United Parcel Service Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy United Parcel Service today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $176.02, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because United Parcel Service’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of United Parcel Service look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 0.05% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for United Parcel Service, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? UPS’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UPS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into United Parcel Service, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Today the company announced ways it is strengthening its network capabilities and enhancing employee experience through automation. UPS is leveraging technology to help reduce repetitive tasks and physical stress while promoting safety for the company’s employees. The technologies will also improve package flow and overall efficiency of the UPS network.""UPS has been a technology company since its founding. Innovation is in our DNA,"" said Carol Tomé, chief executive officer at UPS. ""We continuously look for ways to leverage technology to improve our employee experience and increase efficiency. This is how we build a better and bolder UPS that will continue to be customer-first, people-led and innovation-driven for years to come.""The company’s innovation strategy has long included the use of both digital and automation technologies and this has accelerated with advancements in AI.Recently, UPS made several improvements in its operations targeting specific processes that can be repetitive and physically demanding such as pick-and-place, loading and unloading, and moving irregular-sized shipments.UPS is using pick-and-place technologies powered by Dexterity, Fortna and Plus One Robotics to help employees sort small packages – a role that requires repetitive tasks and can be inconsistent as it flexes with customer demands. Once implemented, the technology will make these jobs easier, safer and offer a better overall experience for UPS employees.UPS is using Pickle Robot’s unloading technologies to ease the challenging job of unloading trailers, making the role less physically demanding for employees and delivering better package care and reliability for UPS customers.UPS is using autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) powered by Dane, Geek+, Locus Robotics, Crown and Toyota-Raymond to simplify demanding jobs. Many of these AGV technologies more safely and easily move small packages and irregular-sized shipments through UPS facilities. Irregular shipments don’t fit on conveyor belts and often can be heavy and difficult to move. These vehicles exponentially streamline these movements and promote safety.UPS is also leveraging digital technologies to ensure the safety of every delivery around the world by using Delivery Photo and Delivery Defense to decrease fraud for customers.Story continuesThe innovations announced today are being used in select UPS facilities across the U.S. as the company continues to execute its strategic plan and provide industry-leading service to its customers with one of the most efficient, globally-integrated networks in the industry.Bala Subramanian, executive vice president and chief digital and technology officer at UPS added, ""In providing industry-leading livelihoods for our people, we are now also using technology, innovation and automation to provide for their well-being. UPSers will always be our differentiator even as we optimize our network through technology.""Innovation has been a cornerstone of UPS’s business strategy since its founding in 1907. This year, 57 percent of the packages processed through the UPS network went through automated facilities that are powered by the latest sorting, processing and data capture technologies. The company’s major air facilities are highly automated with package flow technology, and the company continues to embrace cutting-edge and transformative technologies that advance its business and the logistics industry at-large.Learn more about innovation at UPS here.About UPSUPS (NYSE: UPS) is one of the world’s largest companies, with a 2022 revenue of $100.3 billion, and provides a broad range of integrated logistics solutions for customers in more than 200 countries and territories.

Even though demand for online shopping has slowed down from the pandemic peak with the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, it remains strong.Moreover, additional workers are needed to ensure a repeat of UPS’ buoyant performance witnessed last year with respect to timeliness. Therefore, the decision to hire additional workers to meet the anticipated annual increase in package volume, that will begin in October 2023 through January 2024, is a prudent one.UPS has made the process of hiring employees very easy and uncomplicated. The ease with which new personnel are enrolled is evident from short (less than 20 minutes) duration of the process (in most cases), wherein an applicant can fill out an online form and land a job. Moreover, nearly 80% of seasonal workers do not need to even appear for an interview. Openings are for full and part-time seasonal positions, and will primarily attract delivery drivers, Commercial Driver’s License or CDL drivers and package handlers.In connection with new recruitments, we expect UPS’ rival FedEx FDX to soon announce its plans for adding seasonal employees to its workforce. We note that UPS and FedEx hire multiple temporary workers each year to move more parcels in the October-January period.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while FDX is presently #3 Ranked (Hold).Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like Air Canada ACDVF and Covenant Logistics CVLG.

ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders.

Never miss another market-moving headline.Zions Bancorp slashed at Morgan StanleyZions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) share fell more than 1% pre-market today after Morgan Stanley downgraded the company to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $32.00 (from $27.00).The firm's decision is based on several factors. Zions’ recent strong rally, up over 70% since May lows, has brought its valuation in line with industry peers, ending a period of consistent discount trading throughout 2023.“We believe this skews risk-reward to the downside in a higher for longer rate environment given the elevated risk of NIB outflow which would need to be replaced with higher cost client deposits currently off-balance sheet,” mentioned Morgan Stanley.Valley National cut to UnderweightMorgan Stanley downgraded Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $8.50 (from $8.00), as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.We think Consensus is underestimating the pressure on Valley's NII in a higher for longer rate environment. VLY has a 101% loan-to-deposit ratio (vs. ~84% for peers) which gives them less flexibility on deposit pricing in a higher for longer rate environment.Three more downgradesGordon Haskett downgraded Macy’s (NYSE:M) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $13.00 from $18.00.CFRA downgraded Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $42.00 from $51.00.Gordon Haskett downgraded Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $215.00.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Tractor Supply, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$9.0b - US$2.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Tractor Supply has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Tractor Supply roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Tractor Supply compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Tractor Supply's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 33%, but they have dropped over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Tractor Supply is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 146% to shareholders in the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.If you want to continue researching Tractor Supply, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

To this end, we aim to reduce our water use as much as possible and support initiatives throughout the value chain to conserve water.Our Goal Progress: 14% ReductionIn 2022, we achieved an approximately 14% reduction in water usage at priority sites in areas where water is most scarce. Our goal is to reduce absolute water usage in priority sites by 10% by 2025 (vs. 2018).1Working Together at a Local LevelResponsible water use cannot be tackled at a remote, global level - it involves collective action on the ground, locally. So we are focusing on local and regional stakeholder engagements and community collaborations to broaden impact.Reducing our Water UseAround the world, water is increasingly under pressure due to global population growth, industrialization, and climate change, and we are focusing on playing our part in looking after this precious resource by seeking to reduce water use as muchm as possible.In 2021, we updated our list of priority sites using the Aqueduct tool from World Resources Institute and changed our water scarcity threshold. This led to an increased number of priority sites: from 27 during the 2013-2020 cycle to 48 during the current 2018-2025 cycle.In 2022, we reduced our absolute water use at priority sites by approximately 14% (vs. 2018).Improving Water Use Across EuropeIn Europe, we have made a number of improvements in our water use. In Spain, for example, we have enhanced waste-water treatment, to reduce pollutants in the discharge. We have also reduced water consumption through dry cleaning and automatic floor cleaners.Reusing and Recycling More WaterOur factory in Fallingbostel, northern Germany, has increased its steam boiler condensate return ratio.

The water is recycled and the cleaning program optimized. This saves 35,000m3 of water per year. Our Kaunas factory in Lithuania improved its starch tray cleaning process, reducing water consumption by 3,000m3 a year.Widening our Water StewardshipIn 2022, as the world's water stresses continued to increase, we sought to widen our positive impact by looking beyond our own facilities to assess wider water use along the value chain. We want to cover not just the use of water in our operations - for example to make our products and clean equipment - but also its use to irrigate the commodities that are important to our products.We calculated our water footprint and identified that the majority of the water used in our value chain is in the production of raw materials. So after many years of our successful programs to reduce water consumption in our manufacturing operations, we are now expanding our approach and integrating our water stewardship methodology to key areas beyond our facilities.We can then apply these learnings to the development of an end-to-end 2030 water stewardship strategy.Reducing Water Consumption in PeruAt our factory in Lima, Peru, we have reduced water consumption by 21% against the 2018 baseline by improving the treated water recovery systems. We installed reverse osmosis equipment, which reduces dissolved minerals in the local water. This reduces the amount of water purging required, thereby cutting down on water use.Saving Water in IndiaIn India, we succeeded in saving approximately 29,000m3 of water in our manufacturing processes (vs. 2018). This was primarily achieved through technological advancement projects to improve water management, including permanent magnet technology, recovering up to 85% of condensation, and numerous other enhancements to reduce, recycle, and reuse water. We also harvested 98,000m3 of rainwater.WasteWe strive to reduce waste as much as we can, to help the climate and the environment and to increase our operational efficiency. Above all, we focus on food waste - striving to eliminate it.-25% Food waste reduction in internal manufacturing sites (metric tonnes) (vs. 2018)-58% Food waste reduction in distribution (metric tonnes) (vs. 2018)Our Goal Progress: 25% ReductionIn 2022, we reduced food waste in internal manufacturing sites by 25%, exceeding our goal of a 15% reduction by 2025 (vs. 2018).This early delivery proves our focus on eliminating waste from our sites.We also reduced food waste from distribution by 58%, exceeding our goal of a 50% reduction by 2025 (vs. 2018).Striving to Eliminate Waste Once And For AllWe see food waste as an opponent to be destroyed - it plays against all our sustainability efforts, adding to business and environmental costs, helping no one.The initiatives to eliminate waste have to be robust and sustainable. At Mondelēz International, we have a clear governance of waste reduction globally.We repeat the following steps:Identify hot spots.Deep dive to sites and focus on top losses in main production lines.Focus on process capability improvement through the improvement of equipment, technology, system, people, and material.Across the globe, our waste community is dedicated to:Benchmarking and replicating Integrated Lean Six Sigma (IL6S) best practices to eliminate waste.Leveraging the best engineering and digital solutions for process capability.In-line measurement for real time process intervention, it's a key enabler for our vision.Focus group to coach opportunity sites to eliminate waste.Focusing on Eliminating Food WasteWe have been historically measuring and tackling manufacturing waste generation and disposal. In 2021, we decided to increase our focus on food waste. We believe this makes sense for a food company like us, especially considering that nearly a third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted.Food waste increases the extraction of materials and growth of agriculture ingredients. This will ultimately not be put to good use as it increases the consumption of energy, water, and transportation. Indeed, food waste has an environmental impact that is 10x greater than packaging waste.Helping to Stop Good Food Going to WasteThe best-before date (BBD) is misleading for many consumers, creating confusion with the use-by date, and therefore leading to many edible foods being thrown away. To take a stand against food waste, our Philadelphia brand has partnered with Too Good To Go - an innovative app that lets you buy food right before it goes to waste, in Germany, Denmark, and Sweden.By printing the ""Often Good After"" logo next to the BBD on our Philadelphia packaging and creating ad hoc informative social media videos, we are helping to educate our consumers to first LOOK, SMELL, and TASTE before throwing away anything still good.Too Good To Go - it's a great idea we're happy to be part of.""Too Good To Go is active in several countries, where the topic is becoming more and more sensitive for consumers. We aim to replicate the activity also in other markets to spread the word!""Vanessa HarrerSr Director, Marketing PhiladelphiaPreventing, Reducing and Reusing WasteOur VSA factory team in Brazil implemented a systematic approach to prevent, reduce, and reuse waste - reducing waste by 813 metric tonnes 2022 vs. 2021.In China, our West Suzhou factory ran a process lost analysis on its wafer production line. The team increased process performance and reduced variability - significantly reducing waste on the line from 5.1% to 2.2%, contributing to 121 tons food waste reduction, which is equal to 10,000,000 wafer sticks!Read more in the Mondelēz 2022 Snacking Made Right ReportView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mondelēz International on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Mondelēz InternationalWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mondelez-internationalEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Mondelēz InternationalView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/787621/mondelz-2022-snacking-made-right-report-water-waste]"
610,262a2728-bd82-390a-95f2-5e8f389b985b,MDLZ,2023-09-28,Here's Why Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-mondelez-international-nasdaq-130015128.html,1695733215,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International What Is Mondelez International's Debt?As you can see below, at the end of June 2023, Mondelez International had US$21.2b of debt, up from US$19.2b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have US$2.19b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$19.0b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Mondelez International's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Mondelez International had liabilities of US$18.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$25.3b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.19b and US$3.79b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$37.4b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Mondelez International has a huge market capitalization of US$94.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Mondelez International's net debt is 2.8 times its EBITDA, which is a significant but still reasonable amount of leverage. But its EBIT was about 10.5 times its interest expense, implying the company isn't really paying a high cost to maintain that level of debt. Even were the low cost to prove unsustainable, that is a good sign. One way Mondelez International could vanquish its debt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around 16%, as it did over the last year. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Mondelez International's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Mondelez International produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 62% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Mondelez International's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its net debt to EBITDA does undermine this impression a bit. All these things considered, it appears that Mondelez International can comfortably handle its current debt levels. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

Smucker (NYSE:SJM) announced that it would acquire Hostess Brands (NASDAQ:TWNK), the maker of snack food favorites such as Twinkies and HoHos, for $5.6 billion in cash and stock. The Smucker-Hostess deal is the Ohi0-based company’s largest acquisition in its history. “We are excited to announce the acquisition of Hostess Brands, which represents a compelling expansion of our family of brands and a unique opportunity to accelerate our focus on delighting consumers with convenient solutions across different meal and snacking occasions,” said Mark Smucker, Chair of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer.Since Smucker announced the deal, SJM stock has lost more than 10% of its value, a sign investors disagree with the acquisition. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile it’s way too early to declare the transaction a success or failure, it’s not too early to chime in on some of the pros and cons of Smucker’s making this deal.Here are two reasons to like it and one reason to hate it. The Convenience Store Market Is HugeEmpty grocery cart in a grocery store aisle. Consumer goods.Source: gyn9037 / ShutterstockThe number of suitors for Hostess is said to have been significant. Smucker’s beat out some heavyweight snack businesses such as Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), and Hershey (NYSE:HSY). All three of those businesses have excellent CEOs, so Smucker’s CEO, Mark Smucker, can smile knowing he was the one that secured the iconic snack maker less than two decades removed from its first of two bankruptcies in 2004. Despite the move to healthier snacks in recent years, it’s clear from the battle to buy Hostess that there remains a market for sweet snacks with little nutritional value, but lots of tasty enjoyment. Ultimately, Smucker’s understood how vital Hostess’ convenience store market was to its future growth. For example, the company acquired its Uncrustables brand in 1999 for $1 million. It has done little advertising since then because it couldn’t produce enough. It now has a factory that can blow them out of the water. More importantly, it has figured out how to make a product with bread that can thaw from frozen and remain fresh for five days in a convenience store refrigerator. Story continuesCombining the new bread and convenience store distribution should increase Uncrustable sales from $650 million today to $1 billion soon.    Hostess Has Strong Brand AwarenessA package of two HA package of two Hostess (TWNK) TwinkiesSource: LunaseeStudios / Shutterstock.comThere is no question that Twinkies and HoHos are very popular with the average American. However, the company’s newer products could help Smucker’s expand its snacking business beyond Uncrustables. CEO Andy Callahan appeared in an April 2023 Associated Press article discussing Hostess Brands’ focus on innovation. “It’s the way that brands become contemporary. It’s a way that they stay relevant and it’s the way they create a bridge to a new generation,” Callahan stated. “When I took over Hostess five years ago, we had stopped that process. We’d stopped talking to consumers, we’d stopped innovating. We became more relevant in the business press than we became in the consumer press.”For example, in February, Hostess launched a new product called the Kazbar, which the company describes as “layers of soft chocolate cake, crème, candy crunch and melt-in-your-mouth caramel or smooth chocolate fudge,” stated its press release.  Relevant to the purchase by Smucker’s is the fact that Kazbars are sold in 1.25-ounce and 2.75-ounce packages in convenience stores and grocery stores. With shelf space next to all the other Hostess products, Uncrustables should continue to gain market share. However, it all starts with the strong brand awareness of the Twinkie. Even through two bankruptcies, Americans knew and loved the sweet snack.The Smucker-Hostess Deal Means Too Much Debt and Not Enough Growthcompany sign outside smucker's headquarters SJM stockSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThe deal to buy Hostess, while 12% in stock, will add considerable debt to Smucker’s balance sheet. For example, it’s assuming $900 million in net debt from Hostess. Then, it has to finance approximately 88% of the remaining $4.7 billion in equity. So, let’s call it an even $5 billion in financing. As of July 31, 2023, Smucker’s had $4.32 billion in long-term debt. The Hostess acquisition will double its debt to approximately $9.32 billion. Based on $32.1 million in interest expenses in the latest quarter, its annualized cost on its debt would be $128 million. So, more than doubling its debt increases its annual interest payments to more than a quarter of a billion dollars. That’s not chump change. Further, it has $1 billion in 3.5% senior notes due in March 2025. If interest rates remain elevated until then (a possibility), Smucker’s interest costs on its biggest debt go way up. That doesn’t consider what rate it will pay on the $5 billion in new financing. It should be higher than the rates it’s paying on its existing debt.As for growth, Hostess adds $1.5 billion in annual revenue with mid-single-digit growth. Smucker’s revenues are expected to increase by 9.0% at the midpoint of its guidance for the year.While that sounds good for a packaged foods company, the fact that it’s doubling its debt means it needs to generate significantly more cash flow from operations to pay down the debt in a reasonable amount of time. The company will take more than a year to integrate the Hostess business into its own. History has shown that projected benefits from significant Smucker’s acquisitions in the past — think Big Heart Pet Brands (Milk-Bone, Meow Mix, etc.) — have not produced the results necessary to drive its share price higher. There is a significant risk that Hostess Brands will be another value detractor for the company’s share price. Up just 15% throughout the past five years, Smucker’s shareholders ought to think carefully before holding for another five years.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Much Debt Does Occidental Petroleum Carry?As you can see below, Occidental Petroleum had US$19.1b of debt at June 2023, down from US$22.0b a year prior. However, it also had US$486.0m in cash, and so its net debt is US$18.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Occidental Petroleum's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$7.15b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$34.6b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$486.0m and US$2.85b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$38.4b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$58.0b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Occidental Petroleum's net debt is only 1.1 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 10.9 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Occidental Petroleum if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 21% cut to EBIT over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Occidental Petroleum can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last two years, Occidental Petroleum generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 96% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewBased on what we've seen Occidental Petroleum is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. In particular, we are dazzled with its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Occidental Petroleum's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

And among its oil weighted coverage, [? BOFA ?] sees Occidental as best positioned to capitalize on near term oil, strength, and calls it the firm's top idea.Now Occidental has been such an interesting story. Not just because of what's been happening in the oil markets, generally. But also, because of the investment from Berkshire Hathaway, which continues to bolster those shares.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, it keeps the buy rating. And to your point, on the near term oil strength, says its best idea, capital efficiency, deep drilling backlog. And yes, to your point, Julie. The Berkshire put, as the analyst puts, can help mitigate downside risk. We know Berkshire Hathaway, a stake in this name.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And I'm just seeing a headline as well that Exxon, speaking of oil stocks, closed at a record high in today's session. So that's interesting as well.JOSH LIPTON: All right, moving on. Shares of Palantir getting a boost today after it was announced that the US Army will be selecting Palantir for a new $250 million contract involving, what else? Artificial intelligence. One analyst saying that while this contract adds fuel to the argument that Palantir is more like a government service provider, this contract bodes well for Palantir's fourth quarter and 2024 revenue.Story continuesSo this name-- of course, CEO Alex Karp, never bashful, as we know, predicts Palantir will become, he knows, the most important enterprise company in the world driven by its work in AI. Not everyone, we should mention, believes that. About 40% of analysts on the street have a sell on this name. But still, this one is up, Julie, about 130% now this year.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it is. So obviously, there are some who are buying into that thesis as well. We're also watching shares of Generac, that stock jumping today.One of the top gainers on the S&amp;P 500 after it reiterated its guidance for 2023 and approved-- and provided, I should say, an upbeat longer term outlook. Now the context here is that Generac, last month, came out with a terrible report, and really cost a lot of concern about demand on its generators. So this is-- it coming out and now reiterating is at least reassuring, it seems, to some investors.JOSH LIPTON: Yes, sees 2023 revenue declining 10 - 12%.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +1.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -63.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.80 points to a change of -59.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 indicates a change of +42.8% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $7.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25.3%. The $28.37 billion and $30.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -23.5% and +7.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $6.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.3%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $3.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.95%. The EPS surprise was -2.86%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Using a combination of hands-on experiences and classroom education, our employee STEM councils helped more than 70,000 young people explore careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math in 2022.Hear from three employees whose devotion to STEM education and helping others discover their fullest potential is making a difference around the globe.An investment in the futureMarcelo Gonzalez has always wanted to know how things work. While this curiosity eventually led to a rewarding career, Marcelo didn't always know how to channel it. ""It was my fourth birthday and I'd gotten a pedal go-kart. I wanted to know what made it move, so I followed the chain underneath with my finger and - let's just say it didn't end well,"" says Marcelo, chuckling. Thankfully, his dad rushed him to the hospital and saved his finger, though he still has the scar today.Influenced by his older cousins who were engineers, Marcelo pursued an industrial engineering degree and today, he's a senior quality manager and an active member of his local STEM council in Argentina. His team helps students hear career advice firsthand from Boston Scientific employees and engages them in interactive activities - like seeing what a doctor sees when a stent is placed - using augmented reality and other technologies.For Marcelo, the most rewarding part is working with a passionate and dedicated team to help kids connect their curiosity with the potential to create meaningful innovation. ""To me, investing in these kids is investing in the future,"" he says. ""I'm not going to change the planet much more - but they will.""Stoking the passion earlyLike Marcelo, Ronan Emmett, a talent development manager based in Cork, Ireland, enjoyed taking his toys apart as a child. Ronan's penchant for questioning the world around him led him to pursue a career in information technology before transitioning to teaching, and then human resources and talent development.Story continuesIn 2016, Ronan was part of a team that helped develop the GROW program, a chance for college-level engineering, science and biotechnology students and BSC product builders to spend a summer gaining hands-on experience working on a real production line while receiving mentoring and formal education. Employees and the college students learn together and from one another in this program. Since its establishment in Cork, GROW has expanded to become a global development program for product builders and technicians at the company.GROW's success was the catalyst for the TeenGROW program, geared toward young people aged 15-17. Though originally developed for employees' children, TeenGROW has expanded to include children from underrepresented areas in the community through partnerships with local schools. The program introduces students to robotics, involves them in experiments that apply the scientific method, and allows them to hear from engineers about their career experiences.""The purpose of TeenGROW is to stoke that passion for STEM early,"" says Ronan. ""Being at the company for nine years, I've seen kids go from TeenGROW in the classroom, to GROW gaining real-world experience on our production lines, to becoming a qualified engineer with us,"" Ronan says. ""It's inspiring to see, and it's truly a privilege to be part of such an incredible team that is so invested.""Helping students see real-world applicationsYears before she became an R&amp;D engineer at Boston Scientific, Tess Davis was motivated to pursue a science degree in high school. ""I had a teacher - a woman - who had degrees in both biomedical and mechanical engineering. I thought that was so cool,"" says Tess. ""I knew then that I wanted to pursue the same path, and through a program called Project Lead the Way, I was able to gain first-hand experience in the engineering field.""Today, she's the co-lead of the STEM Council in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which brings educational experiences to kids at local schools and organizations like the Boys &amp; Girls Club. A student favorite is Procedure Pal, an interactive table-top product model. ""We show them how an esophageal stent is placed in the body, or how a deep brain stimulation device interrupts brain signals in patients with Parkinson's disease,"" says Tess. ""It helps students see how these technologies are actually used to help people.""Tess and the team hold multiple events each year, like the recent panel discussion with members of the Society of Women Engineers, who talked about their paths to becoming STEM professionals. ""It's important to see representation of women in the field,"" says Tess, recalling the indelible mark her high school teacher had on her professional journey. ""Kids don't always have those role models. I've heard many of our volunteers say, 'I didn't have these opportunities growing up. I want them to know what's possible.'""Learn more about the ways Boston Scientific supports STEM education in communities around the world.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/boston-scientificEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/787749/boston-scientific-encouraging-and-empowering-tomorrows-stem-pioneers]"

That equates to about 1.7 cups daily for everyone in the U.S., or 2.8 cups daily per coffee drinker, amounts which have remained steady since 2020, the group says.The U.S. imports the most coffee and is expected to import 20% of the world's volume of coffee in 2023-2024 (about 28.3 million bags, compared to 47.5 million in the European Union), the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.But the U.S. doesn't even rank among the top ten countries in terms of per capita coffee consumption (324 cups per capita), falling far below Lebanon, which is No. 1 at 1,516 cups annually, according to research firm Euromonitor International.Many drink coffee for its caffeine content to help them wake up and remain alert; the Food and Drug Administration says healthy adults can have 4-5 cups daily and stay within the recommended caffeine limit of 400 milligrams a day. But think about the size of your cup: a 16-ounce cup of Starbucks coffee can have 260-360 mg of caffeine, depending on the roast; while a 14-ounce cup of Dunkin' Coffee has 210 mg, according to Center for Science in the Public Interest.Medical research has also suggested that moderate coffee intake (2-5 cups daily) coffee could help you live longer and help prevent some diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, heart disease and depression, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But too much caffeine can also cause anxiety in people with panic or anxiety disorders, research suggests.Coffee drinkers, over the last year, have increased spending on dry coffee, to brew at home, up 6.5%, while spending at Starbucks and other limited service restaurants is down 4.6%, during the 52-week period ending May 31, 2023, according to market research firm Numerator.Story continues""Since the pandemic we have seen more consumers upleveling their coffee experience at home,"" Starbucks Coffee developer Leslie Wolford told USA TODAY.

Also, ULTA is benefiting from its Wellness Shop launch (in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021), which is a cross-category platform providing guests with self-care for the mind, body and spirit across several stores and online.  The company’s initiatives to boost online promotions and customer engagement have also been supporting online sales growth. With consumers growing enthusiasm toward online sales, management remains on track with expanding capacity at fulfillment centers, the expansion of ship-from-store capabilities and curbside pickups.Ulta Beauty is also benefiting from its mobile app and virtual try-on capabilities. That said, the majority of customers continue to transact only from the company’s stores. In the second quarter, Ulta Beauty introduced three new stores, remodeled three and relocated two. For fiscal 2023, management expects 25-30 net new stores, along with 20-30 store remodeling and relocation projects.Story continuesSkincare Stands OutUlta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out. The trend continued in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein skincare was the company’s best-performing category.The company saw double-digit growth in both mass and prestige. Results gained from newness in brands like Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Supergoop!, along with new brands like Bubble, Beautycounter and BYOMA. Guests’ increased focus on self-care and maintaining healthy skincare routines, along with the company’s focus on innovation, works well for the skincare category.SG&amp;A Costs to Remain High?Ulta Beauty’s SG&amp;A expenses have been rising year over year for a while now. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, SG&amp;A expenses rose 12.4% to $600.7 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses came in at 23.7%, up from 23.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses was due to the deleverage of store payroll and benefits, increased store expenses and corporate overheads related to strategic investments. The operating margin decreased from 17% to 15.5% in the second quarter.Management expects an operating margin between 14.6% and 14.8%, which includes expectations of nearly even deleverage from the gross margin and SG&amp;A. Management expects the operating margin to be under more pressure in the third quarter than the second quarter as it laps pricing gains (compared with the year-ago period) and due to an investment spending shift from the second quarter to the third quarter. Consequently, the third-quarter EPS is likely to decline year over year.What’s Ahead?Ulta Beauty’s strong business model, diverse assortment and solid loyalty program helped drive splendid results and encouraged management to raise its fiscal 2023 view. Management now expects fiscal 2023 net sales in the range of $11.05-$11.15 billion compared with the $11-$11.1 billion band expected earlier. Comparable sales are expected to rise 4.5%-5.5%, up from 4-5% growth expected earlier. The company expects comps growth to moderate-to-low-single-digit growth in the second half of the year.For fiscal 2023, earnings are envisioned in the band of $25.10-$25.60 per share, suggesting a rise from the $24.01 per share reported in fiscal 2022. Management earlier projected the bottom line in the range of $24.70-$25.40 per share.Shares of Ulta Beauty have risen 1.1% in the past year against an equal decline of the industry.Robust Retail BetsHere, we have highlighted three better-ranked retail stocks.Dillard's, Inc.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with RHI. Click here to check it out. ULTA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ULTAAs of 2023-09-25, Ulta Beauty Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $748.01. It's currently trading at a price of $398.73. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 46.69%. The company is significantly undervalued.Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Ulta Beauty Inc's Intrinsic Value ofThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Ulta Beauty Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$24.92GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.5%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 19.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=380.44Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=367.57Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=748.01Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $597.88. This valuation indicates that the Ulta Beauty Inc is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 33.31%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ.Details of the DealValued at $12.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will supply peculiar support equipment (PSE) and 29 nondestructive inspection (NDI) kits for the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G jets. These equipment will help mitigate deficient fleet quantities of PSE and NDI kits used to inspect and repair multiple components on these two aircraft.Work related to this deal will be carried out in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales implies a year-over-year improvement of 5.7%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT’s 2023 sales implies an improvement of 0.9% from the 2022 reported figure.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2023 sales implies an improvement of 7.7% from the 2022 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 55.8% in the past 12 months against the industry’s decline of 5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA, has offered the award.Valued at $19.7 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by December 2024. The work related to the deal will be executed in East Hartford, CT.What’s Favoring RTX?The need to modernize military equipment and their capabilities has necessitated increased spending on defense and national security. This has contributed to the increased demand for military aircraft as well since they play a critical role in military missions.Such strong demand tends to benefit RTX Corp. as its Pratt &amp; Whitney business unit is an industry leader in the design, manufacture and maintenance of APUs and compact engines for powering military aircraft. The company also serves as a major supplier of gas turbine engines for a host of turboprops like the V-22 Osprey aircraft, as well as turbofan and turboshaft aircraft.RTX’s combat-proven product portfolio of APUs includes PW980, APS5000, APS3200 and a few more, which serve a wide range of military aircraft and thus enjoy strong demand.

(Photo: Shutterstock/RJ Bobin - Orlowski Designs LLC)Ohio’s two senators want the federal government to declare East Palestine, the town where a Norfolk Southern train derailed on Feb. 3, as being under a public health emergency so that local residents can get long-term access to medical care.Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican Sen. J.D. Vance asked the Environmental Protection Agency in a Tuesday letter to explore designating East Palestine as an area where a public health emergency occurred following the February train derailment.About 20 cars involved in the derailment contained hazardous materials, the senators said, quoting EPA’s findings. Several days after the incident, public officials and NS decided to vent five tank cars containing vinyl chloride out of concern that the cars could explode because of chemical reactions happening inside the rail cars.The senators say the venting of the rail cars and the burning of the vinyl chloride may have released chemicals into the air, water and soil of East Palestine and surrounding communities. Even though there have been cleanup efforts, given the uncertainties about what the long-term environmental and public health impacts might be, “residents’ concerns will remain about potential harms caused by exposure to the dangerous chemicals released as a result of the derailment,” they said in a Tuesday letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan.“We understand that federal, state, and local monitoring and assessment activities currently report that the air, ground water, and drinking water in East Palestine and surrounding communities is safe. However, we cannot disregard the long-term potential for contaminants to migrate and impact surface, ground, or drinking water in the region, or preclude the emergence of serious medical conditions linked to the exposure of environmental contaminants from the derailment over the long-term,” the senators said.Declaring the area as being under a public health emergency would enable the Department of Health and Human Services to provide Medicare coverage and other health-related resources to local residents. EPA would issue that determination under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).Story continues“No affected resident of East Palestine or its surrounding communities should have to worry about affording necessary health care, now or in the future. It is incumbent on us to explore using every tool available to the federal government in the service of that goal,” the senators said.In response to the senators’ effort, NS (NYSE: NSC) told FreightWaves that “from the beginning, Norfolk Southern has committed to making it right in East Palestine and covering all costs associated with the clean-up. In the months since, we have made significant progress, keeping our promises to safely and thoroughly clean the derailment site, support the needs of the community, and invest in its future. We remain committed to East Palestine today, and into the future, and will continue to work closely with federal, state, and local leaders.”Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Biden holding Norfolk Southern accountable for East Palestine recoveryNorfolk Southern to create executive role as part of safety revampFRA, OSHA call on Norfolk Southern to review safety practicesNS works to move past $803M hit from Ohio derailmentOhio presses Biden for disaster relief for East PalestineThe post Ohio senators seek public health emergency declaration for East Palestine appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

These companies are mainly known for their financial stability and the ability to generate consistent cash flows, which allows them to sustain and grow their dividend payments even during economic downturns. While dividend stocks haven't performed as well as the overall market this year, their attractiveness and advantages are pulling investors back toward them. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has gained 0.04% this year so far and its 12-month returns came in at 9.27%, as of September 25.One of the main reasons for the growing appeal of dividend stocks is the power of compounding. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividends have played a vital role in the profits investors have made over the past 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total gains in the S&amp;P 500 Index can be traced back to the practice of reinvesting dividends and the power of compounding. The report also mentioned that between 1930 and 2022, dividend income typically made up 41% of the total return from the S&amp;P 500 Index.Dividend stocks are mainly defensive. Despite everything that has occurred this year, such as the regional banking issues, it's important not to overlook how well the Aristocrats performed last year. They had a negative return of 6.5%, which was much better than the S&amp;P 500's negative return of 18%. Furthermore, the Aristocrats also offered some protection from the bond market's significant losses in various asset categories. In 2022, when investors were concerned about the stock valuations, high dividend funds did well because they offered attractive yields to income-seeking investors.Story continuesAlso Read: S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Analyst RatingsSimeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, spoke to Barron’s about the benefits of dividend aristocrat stocks, which include their history of raising dividends, financial stability, and solid cash generation.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

If you want to skip our detailed industrial analysis of global waste management, head straight to the 5 $100K Jobs No One Wants. We often hear about the most popular and in-demand jobs with high salaries and respect those professions' command over our admiration. For example, being an astronaut is considered one of the coolest jobs in the world whereas the highest demanded job in the world is that of a nurse practitioner. Not only do these jobs pay well but are also amongst the most respected professions in the world. However, concealed in the shadows, lie jobs that often remain vacant, shunned by most because of either their challenging nature, societal stigma, or lack of appeal. Most of the jobs on our list of $100K jobs no one wants fall under the industry of waste management. This is because the industry heavily relies on the physically demanding, hazardous, and often unpleasant nature of waste-handling jobs. Not only are these jobs left vacant but those who do choose them do so out of necessity rather than preference. Despite these realities, the industry shows positive signs of growth. According to Allied Market Research, the global waste management market was valued at $1,612 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $2,483 billion by 2030, with a CAGR  of 3.4% from 2021 to 2030. This market includes the collection, transportation, and disposal of different waste types like solid, liquid, and gas, across municipal, industrial, and hazardous waste sectors.The market's growth is primarily driven by government initiatives to combat illegal dumping and the adoption of Waste-to-Energy (WTE) incineration and recycling techniques. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) which was implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), plays a crucial role in managing hazardous and nonhazardous waste. Moreover, the surge in global population and industrialization, particularly in emerging economies like India, China, and Taiwan, has contributed to increased waste generation globally.Story continuesAs sustainability has taken over every industry around the world, the industry of waste management was no exception. Waste Management, Inc (NYSE:WM) is leading the charge in sustainable waste management, as it is tackling environmental challenges head-on. With approximately 125 million tons of waste under its stewardship annually, the company operates 255 active landfill sites across the US and Canada and implements innovative practices to minimize environmental impact. Waste Management, Inc (NYSE:WM)’s groundbreaking initiatives include the conversion of landfill gas into renewable electricity and fuel, with 144 active sites in their landfill gas-to-energy program, and plans to invest $825 million by 2026 in expanding this effort. According to their sustainability report of 2022, the investment by Waste Management, Inc (NYSE:WM) aims to capture 65% of landfill gas for beneficial reuse, which is essentially a 600% increase at WM-owned RNG plants that is capable of powering the equivalent of 1 million North American homes.  One of the least favored jobs we came across during our research was that of a sewage inspector. Owing to unpleasant and unsanitary working conditions and the fact that they have to inevitably deal with the worst smells and physically torturous tasks in cramped, dirty spaces, it is one of the high paying jobs that no one wants to do. However, as industries are being revolutionized by Ai and automation, the jobs for sanitation and sewage have also been automated.Veolia Water Technologies, a water division of Veolia Environnement S.A (OTC:VE) has largely streamlined jobs for sewage inspectors by leveraging advanced technologies and wastewater treatment solutions. Through their expertise in wastewater treatment, Veolia helps municipalities and industrial facilities meet stringent environmental regulations while optimizing economic goals.One key aspect of Veolia Environment S.A (OTC:VE)’s approach is the implementation of automated systems and processes that reduce the need for manual inspection and intervention. These automated systems can monitor and control different components of wastewater treatment like the removal of pollutants and the quality of effluent. By automating routine tasks and incorporating real-time data analytics, Veolia Water Technologies enables sewage inspectors to focus on more complex and strategic aspects of their roles, such as troubleshooting and system optimization. In doing so, Veolia Environment S.A (OTC:VE) contributes to a safer and more efficient working environment for sewage inspectors while ensuring that wastewater treatment facilities consistently meet regulatory requirements. Apart from their automation strategies, their financials have been equally impressive. In their half year results for 2023, Veolia Environment S.A (OTC:VE) achieved strong financial performance, with revenue reaching approximately $24,408 million with a growth of 14.2% YoY. Veolia Environment S.A (OTC:VE)’s EBITDA rose to approximately $3,394 million which indicated a fair organic growth rate of 8.2%. Veolia Environment S.A (OTC:VE)’s current net income grew by 18.7% and reached $704 million, approximately.16 $100K Jobs No One WantsCopyright: meinzahn / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyFor our list of $100K jobs no one wants to do, we conducted extensive research on the internet to compile a list.

Long hours of hard work often lead to exhaustion and physical strain. Additionally, the isolation from family and friends during extended fishing trips can strain personal relationships. The unpredictable nature of crab populations and market prices can make it financially unstable, adding to the stress.Some fishermen have quoted earning as high as $150,000 to $170,000 per year. Even though their jobs are mostly seasonal, they usually earn around $50,000 for the work of 3-4 months.9. Underwater WelderThe welders must work in an underwater environment, where they frequently face the risk of drowning, hypothermia, and decompression sickness. The job demands specialized training, equipment, and certifications which also cause issues of accessibility when compared to traditional welding. Any job that is this physically demanding and isolated can be considered mentally and physically exhausting. It is one of the high-paying jobs nobody wants.Underwater welders with a specialization in saturated diving can expect to earn as much as $300,000​ per year.8. Truck DriverLong hours on the road often mean extended periods away from family and loved ones, which can strain personal relationships. Truck driving also involves a sedentary lifestyle which can lead to health concerns. Safety is also a significant concern for many, as truck drivers face risks on the road. Moreover, the looming threat of automation raises questions about job security in the future. It is one of the $100K jobs nobody wants without a degree. In 2022, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) announced that it will increase the salaries of its truck drivers to $100,000 in Utah.7. Elevator Installers and RepairersOne major concern for not wanting this job is claustrophobia, as the job often involves working in tight and confined spaces within elevator shafts. Hence, if one fears closed spaces, this job will be a big no for me. Moreover, exposure to heights and the necessity for specialized technical skills can collectively contribute to the job's unattractiveness for some people. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), elevator repairers and installers earn a median annual wage of $99,000. 6. PlumberThe downside of plumbing jobs is that it involve physically demanding skills and sometimes dirty work, which can be unappealing to many. Moreover, there's also a societal bias that tends to value white-collar professions over skilled trades. It can also be the fact that plumbing often requires dealing with emergencies and working irregular hours, which can disrupt the work-life balance. However, it is also one of the part-time retirement jobs that pay well. The highest average salary of a journeyman plumber in the United States is $99,500.Click here to see the 5 $100K Jobs No One Wants.Suggested Articles:30 High-Paying Remote Jobs Without a Degree or Experience.25 Highest Paying Jobs in the World.17 Highest Paying Government Jobs Without a Degree.Disclosure: None. 16 $100K Jobs No One Wants is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

Let’s take a closer look at each.DaVitaDaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the U.S. to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with expectations creeping higher across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company sports a solid growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 10% on 2% higher revenues in its current year. Peeking ahead, estimates for FY24 allude to a further 6% earnings boost paired with a 2.5% sales bump.And DaVita plans to extend its footprint, providing further runways for growth.

In fact, the company has beaten consensus EPS expectations by an average of 21% across its last four releases.Walmart Many are familiar with the titan Walmart, with its product portfolio covering nearly every aspect of retail and being known for relatively low prices. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across all timeframes, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncome-focused investors could be attracted to WMT shares, currently yielding a respectable 1.4% annually. And the company has shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, with the payout growing a modest 2% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company recently upped its FY24 guidance following robust quarterly results, with strong sales growth and continued business momentum providing solid tailwinds.AflacAflac, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. The company has seen modest positive earnings estimate revisions among all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike DVA, Aflac has consistently posted bottom line results above expectations, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 8% across its last four releases.

The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 15.1% growth in the said time frame.The renowned global developer and supplier of better treatments has a market capitalization of $8.23 billion. Catalent projects 18% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Catalent’s earnings yield of 1.8% is favorable to the industry’s negative yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product and Service Launches: We are upbeat about Catalent’s product and service launches over the past few months. In March, Catalent announced the launch of the ProteoSuite Oral suite, which allows the rational selection of orally developable targeted protein degrader candidates and their advancement into clinical trials. The same month, Catalent announced the expansion of its UpTempo platform process for the development and cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) manufacturing of adeno-associated viral vectors.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about Catalent’s robust growth opportunities via its recent tie-ups and buyouts. In August, the company entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Elliott Investment Management L.P., one of Catalent’s investors. This agreement is likely to improve operational efficiencies and drive long-term value.In March, the company signed a commercial supply agreement with Harm Reduction Therapeutics.Strong Q4 Results: Catalent’s solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment. Management’s confirmation regarding Catalent’s continued progress in improving its operational performance and winning new business with new and existing customers raises our optimism.Story continuesDownsidesForex Fluctuations: Catalent has significant operations outside the United States. Hence, changes in the exchange rates or any other applicable currency to the U.S. dollar will affect its operations. Volatility in currency exchange rates and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort the company may undertake to manage or mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies.Stiff Competition: Catalent operates in a highly competitive market, wherein it competes with multiple companies, including those offering advanced delivery technologies and outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing. The company also competes in some cases with the internal operations of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health customers with manufacturing capabilities and chooses to source these services internally.Estimate TrendCatalent has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 43.1% south to 82 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $933.2 million, suggesting an 8.7% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 94.2%.Key Growth CatalystsStrong Portfolio Expansion: Penumbra is still in the early stages of its journey to bring the company’s proprietary thrombectomy technologies to patients in the United States and internationally. The company’s consistent revenue growth momentum is being driven by the extraordinary outcomes Penumbra is witnessing in patients treated with Lightning Flash, Lightning Bolt 7 and RED 72 with SENDit technology.According to the company, Lightning Flash's transformative power, speed, safety and efficacy profile is the biggest driver of the exceptional early adoption of the product. In terms of Lightning Bolt 7, Penumbra is seeing an acceleration of Lightning Bolt 7 cases in the last two months of the second quarter as conversion from surgery, lytics and other mechanical thrombectomy products are gaining momentum. At the end of the second quarter, Penumbra has more than 1,000 active submissions in hospitals for either Lightning Flash or Lightning Bolt 7 approval.Robust Vascular Business Growth: Penumbra is demonstrating strong growth within the company’s Vascular business, banking on the rapid increase in sales of the company’s vascular thrombectomy products in the United States. In this region, the company benefits from new product sales and further market penetration of existing products. Meanwhile, despite supply-related issues, the Lightning Flash launch in 2023 exceeded Penumbra’s expectations, becoming the biggest product launch in the company's history. Lightning Flash is also driving an acceleration in Penumbra’s U.S. vascular thrombectomy franchise, which grew nearly 24% year over year in the second quarter.Story continuesStable Solvency Structure: Penumbra exited the second quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $221 million compared with $199 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023.

It also represented a drop from 2.3% in the first quarter.

OMCL is well poised for growth in coming quarters owing to strong execution of strategies, disciplined cost management and revenue timing. An increase in Omnicell’s service revenues emphasizes its digital transformation strategy. However, stiff competition and mounting operating expenses raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 48.9% compared with a 35.1% decline of the industry and a 16.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device solutions provider has a market capitalization of $2.06 billion. Its first-quarter 2023 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 208.4%. The long-term expected growth rate is estimated to be 9.4% compared with the industry’s projection of 19.3%.Let’s delve deeper.Strategic Imperatives to Drive Growth: Omnicell is progressing well with its 3-legged strategy that covers market expansion through delivery of differentiated, innovative solutions, expansion into new markets primarily outside the United States, and expansion through strategic partnerships and acquisition of new technologies.In the second quarter of 2023, a central pharmacy customer in Minnesota decided to upgrade its automated dispensing system to Omnicell’s XT cabinets and also contracted for an inventory optimization service. Another existing XT customer, based in Southern California, chose Omnicell's specialty pharmacy services to support the launch of a health system-owned specialty pharmacy.Following the successful implementation of inventory optimization service for a group of its hospitals, a major southern health system has expanded the service to nearly 20 hospitals.2025 Roadmap Looks Impressive:  OMCL is targeting to reach $1.9-$2 billion of revenues by 2025, with a 14-15% compounded total annual revenue growth rate from 2021 to 2025. It is also aiming an expansion of non-GAAP EBITDA margin from 21% in 2021 to 25% by 2025, representing a margin expansion of approximately 400 bps. The company is well-positioned to deliver on 2025 total revenue growth targets, driven by factors like growing its tech services revenues, benefits from long-term sole source customer partnerships, multi-year co-development plans and increased average deal sizes.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor full-year 2022, OMCL delivered non-GAAP EBITDA of $193 million, above the previously guided range of $177-$183 million as announced during the third-quarter 2022 earnings call.Strong Liquidity and Capital Structure: Omnicell exited second-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $399.5 million compared with $330.4 million as of Dec 31, 2022.  The company did not report any short-term debt on its balance sheet at second-quarter end, which highlights a sound solvency position. Further, it had debt-to-capital of 32.8% at second-quarter end compared with the industry’s 40.2%.DownsidesEscalating Expenses May Strain Margins: OMCL has adopted several strategies to drive its top line including portfolio expansion, acquisitions and further penetration in the medication adherence market. Similar to its healthcare system partners, the company’s operations continue to be affected by persisting labor shortages and increased inflationary costs related to components’ raw materials and freight.Competitive Landscape: Omnicell faces intense competition in the medication management and supply-chain solutions market. Even though the company continues to gain market share from other traditional providers of medication management and supply-chain solutions, major players are Becton Dickinson/CareFusion Corporation, ARxIUM, Cerner Corporation, Talyst, Inc., Emerson Electronic Co., WaveMark Inc.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Omnicell’s 2023 earnings per share has moved from $1.65 to $1.76.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, suggesting an 8.8% fall from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

INSP is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its focus on research and development (R&amp;D). The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and a few regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on the Inspire system and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.1% against the industry’s 32.1% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 19.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical technology company focused on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has a market capitalization of $5.43 billion. The company projects 74.4% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Inspire Medical has delivered an earnings surprise of 45.6% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Focus on R&amp;D: Inspire Medical’s foundational commitment to driving innovation and improving patient lives fuels its continuous product development, raising our optimism. Per management, the company intends to invest in existing and next-generation technologies to further improve its products and clinical outcomes, optimize patient acceptance and comfort and broaden the patient population that can benefit from Inspire therapy. Recent examples of Inspire Medical’s product innovation include the next generation of the Inspire neurostimulator, which is in development, and an active project to improve the physician programmer.Regulatory Approvals: We are upbeat about Inspire Medical’s receipt of a slew of FDA approvals over the past few months. In June 2023, Inspire Medical submitted a premarket approval supplement to the FDA for its next-generation Inspire system. Also, in June 2023, it received approval from the FDA on an expanded indication, which includes an increase on the upper limit of the Apnea Hypopnea Index to 100 events per hour from 65, and raises the Body Mass Index warning in the labeling to 40 from 32.Strong Q2 Results: Inspire Medical’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust improvement in the top line and strength in year-over-year geographic results. Activation of new U.S. centers and the creation of new U.S. sales territories were also recorded during the reported quarter.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on Inspire System: Sales of Inspire Medical’s Inspire system accounted for primarily all its revenues for the past few years. The company’s ability to execute its growth strategy and become profitable will, therefore, depend upon the adoption of the Inspire therapy to treat moderate-to-severe OSA in patients who are unable to use or get consistent benefits from continuous positive airway pressure. Management cannot ensure that the company’s Inspire therapy will achieve or maintain broad market acceptance among physicians and patients.Stiff Competition: The medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Inspire Medical’s competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat moderate to severe OSA.Estimate TrendInspire Medical has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023.

Within Core Diagnostics, the company is gaining market share following the end of the public health emergency, particularly in the United States and Europe region. However, forex woes and lower COVID sales impede growth.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has declined 0.9% compared with a 1.4% rise of the industry and a 19.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $169.15 billion. The company projects a 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 12.44%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayStrong Prospects Within Core Diagnostics: Abbott is expanding the Diagnostics business foothold (consisting of nearly 30% of the company’s total revenues in the second quarter of 2023). In the past few quarters, there has been a decline in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19, primarily offset by higher growth across other businesses. Abbott is experiencing increased demand for routine diagnostic testing in the United States and Europe. In the United States, Abbott is registering strong growth within the blood transfusion testing business, consistently recovering from lower plasma donations during the COVID-19 pandemic.Sales Recovery Within Nutrition: Following the massive setback related to the voluntary recall and production stoppage of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, MI, last year. Abbott’s Nutrition business has started showing signs of recovery since the beginning of 2023. Per the last update on the second-quarter earnings call, the company has made good progress in increasing manufacturing production. It has now recovered approximately 75% of the market share in the infant formula business.Story continuesStable Liquidity Position: With total debt (including the current portion) of $16.85 billion as of Jun 30, 2023, Abbott looks quite comfortable from the liquidity point of view. The company’s cash and cash equivalents were $8.16 billion at the end of second-quarter 2023. Although the second quarter’s total debt was much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalent level, the company has $2.28 billion of short-term payable debt on its balance sheet, much lower than the short-term cash level.Further, in each of the first two quarters of 2023, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of 51 cents per share on its common shares, indicating an increase of 8.5% from 47 cents declared in each of the first two quarters of 2022.DownsidesDeclining COVID Testing Dents Growth: Through the last few months of 2022 and following the official ending of the public health emergency in May, Abbott is experiencing a persistent decline in COVID testing-related demand. Through the first six months of 2023, Abbott’s Rapid Diagnostics sales plunged 67.9% from the year-ago period’s levels due to lower demand for COVID-19 tests.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a significant headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies has constantly been hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.In the second quarter, foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on sales.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been constant at $4.40.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.77 billion, suggesting an 8.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

The two new kits are the QIAwave RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and the QIAwave DNA/RNA Mini Kit, eco-friendlier versions of the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and the All DNA/RNA Mini Kit.The recent launch will fortify QIAGEN’s Life Sciences Business.More on QIAwave KitsIn contrast to QIAGEN's regular kits, QIAwave kits are designed to provide researchers with a more environmentally friendly option while retaining the same excellent performance and chemistry.For extracting DNA, RNA, and plasmid DNA from samples, QIAwave kits use up to 62% less plastic and up to 58% less cardboard than QIAGEN's most popular kits, making them a more environmentally friendly lab option. The kits have fewer parts, waste tubes made entirely of recyclable plastic and appropriate buffer concentrations in smaller bottles.The QIAwave RNeasy Plus Mini Kit utilizes a variety of cultured cells and simple-to-lyse tissues, which enables the separation of high-purity and high-yield total RNA with an integrated gDNA removal. With the QIAwave DNA/RNA Mini Kit, genomic DNA and total RNA may be extracted simultaneously from each cell or tissue sample, and the extracted DNA and RNA can then be eluted individually.Significance of Latest Kits LaunchQIAGEN aims to reduce its plastic footprint by replacing expanded polystyrene (EPS) boxes for cooled shipments with recyclable straw equivalents and other plastic packaging with more environmentally friendly alternatives. In 2022, QIAGEN lowered their plastic transportation usage by 16.5%, significantly doubling the aim of at least a 9% reduction.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer QIAGEN management, introducing the new QIAwave kits broadens its selection of environmentally friendly products and reaffirms its commitment to helping researchers advance science while leaving a smaller environmental footprint.

664,584ffeec-c834-3130-ac54-35038bc034c4,WHR,2023-09-28,Beware! 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Waving Massive Red Flags Right Now.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beware-7-blue-chip-stocks-180514852.html,1695233114,STORY,"['NFLX', 'GPS', 'CMCSA', 'JWN', 'WHR', 'DAL', 'BKNG', 'HD']","[Sometimes, even blue-chip stocks can generate substantial losses. Disney (NYSE:DIS), for example, plummeted as consumers ditched cable television. Top retail stocks took a hit as they lost market share to online competitors. Others, like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pulled back because valuations became far too rich. Whatever the case may be, it’s important to stay on top of your blue-chip investments, especially if they’re waving massive red flags. In fact, here are seven more examples of top blue-chip stocks to sell.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Booking Holdings (BKNG)a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphoneSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comThere are signs the leisure travel boom is at its end, which is a negative for Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), America’s largest online travel agency. For example, Wyndham Hotel (NYSE:WH) recently noted that in late July, growth in the demand for its hotels had dropped in the U.S. last quarter, while its profits had fallen. In addition, as I noted in a previous column, “two discount airlines: Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and Frontier recently warned that Q3 revenues were trending below their previous expectations.Insiders have also been selling stock recently. But that’ll happen when a stock reaches stellar heights, as BKNG has done. CEO Glenn Fogel, for example, sold about $2.4 million worth of stock. Chief Financial Officer David Goulden also sold about $1.8 million worth of stock. Also, unlike many names in the travel space, BKNG stock is not trading at a low valuation. In fact, it trades at 19x forward earnings, which isn’t too far from where the S&amp;P 500 trades.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDelta Airlines (DAL)a Delta (DAL) plane flying through the cloudsSource: NextNewMedia / Shutterstock.comDelta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) has apparently been dragged down by the travel slowdown, and higher oil prices. The latter, of course, will increase the firm’s costs and lower its profits.Story continuesGiven these points, it’s not surprising that the airline recently cut its third-quarter earnings per share guidance to $1.83 to $2.05 from $2.20 to $2.50. In addition, DAL now expects its revenue per available seat mile to fall 2% to 3% year-over-year this quarter. Although the company reiterated its full-year earnings per share guidance of $6 to $7, I believe that this outlook could very well be too optimistic at this point. At a minimum, its EPS is likely to come in towards the low end of the range.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Comcast (CMCSA)Keeping NBC News on the Air Could Hamper Comcast StockSource: ShutterstockAt first glance, Comcast’s (NYSE:CMCSA) second-quarter results appear okay. For example, its top line climbed 1.6% year over year. Meanwhile, net income,  advanced 4.8% year over year. Most of those increases were reportedly driven by the reopening of company theme parks.Unfortunately, Comcast’s other, steadier businesses delivered rather discouraging results. Most worrisome for CMCSA stock was the 0.4% YOY decline in the revenue of its Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and the net loss by that business of 65,000 of its customers last quarter. That unit encompasses the firm’s broadband internet and cable TV offerings.In addition, competition from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and other telecom companies is starting to meaningfully erode Comcast’s broadband Internet unit. All while its cable TV business continues to lose customers. Also, the revenue of its media business was little changed year over year. We also have to consider that consumer cord-cutting won’t exactly help the stock moving forward either.Home Depot (HD)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukAs I pointed out in a previous column, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is being hurt by a low number of homes being sold due to the current, elevated interest rates.  Indeed, last quarter, HD’s comparable sales sank 2% year over year, while its operating income tumbled a rather discouraging 8.6%. I don’t see much improvement in the foreseeable future, especially with seasonally adjusted housing starts down 11.3% in August, year over year.While I do expect the Fed to cut interest rates early next year, it will likely take until the middle or end of next year for home starts and home sales to rebound meaningfully. By that time, HD stock is likely to have fallen a great deal.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Gap (GPS)Source: ShutterstockSome may quarrel with my inclusion of Gap (NYSE:GPS) on a list of blue-chip stocks. But the company’s Gap and Old Navy stores are quite ubiquitous in the U.S., making the country a top brick-and-mortar realtor. As a result, I think that GPS does qualify as a blue-chip stock. Last quarter, the company’s comparable sales tumbled 6% year over year. Online sales sank 11%. In addition, GPS reported that  Old Navy, which used to be a pillar of strength for the firm, suffered “a comparable sales drop of 6%.” Gap also expects its revenue to dive at least 10% during the current quarter.Clearly, the company’s offerings are just not resonating with consumers, and/or it’s being eaten alive by its competition. GPS has to figure out how to turn its business around. And until it does so, GPS is clearly one of the blue-chip stocks to sell now.Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLike Gap, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is one of America’s top apparel retailers. Unfortunately for JWN and its peers, analysts, on average, expect U.S. apparel sales to climb only 1% during the upcoming holiday season.Nordstrom’s sales tumbled 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Excluding the closure of its Canadian operations and the timing of a key sale, its revenue would have declined “only” 4% year-over-year, the firm reported. Still, the retailer expects its revenue to sink 4% to 6% year-over-year in Q3, showing that its performance is not likely to improve anytime soon. Also noteworthy is that its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped to $192 million from %$202 million in Q2 of 2022.As with Gap, Nordstrom appears to be losing a significant amount of market share and has to find a way to turn itself around.Whirlpool (WHR)Source: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.comClearly, appliance maker Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) is, like Home Depot, being badly hurt by the low number of home sales. Whirlpool is, of course, being hurt by the trend because people who move into new homes often buy new appliances for them, while builders add new appliances to the houses that they’ve created.Whirlpool’s top line sank 6% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while its operations burned $370 million of cash, nearly the $180 million that its operations used during the same period a year earlier.Until home sales show signs of starting to recover meaningfully, WHR stock is unlikely to advance much and could very well drop a great deal. Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the section on HD, I don’t expect home sales to start recovering until the middle of 2024 at the earliest.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

667,ebd59928-1eca-3c20-84d5-1aa01e851464,IR,2023-09-28,Here's Why It Is Worth Investing in Applied Industrial (AIT),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-worth-investing-applied-144500759.html,1695825900,STORY,"['AIT', 'CAT', 'TT', 'ETN']","[Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. AIT is benefiting from strength in its Service Center Based Distribution segment and solid momentum in the end markets. Focus on pricing and cross-selling actions, and growth initiatives augur well for the company.Let’s delve into the factors, which make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a smart investment choice at the moment.Segmental Strength: Robust growth across the U.S. Service Center network and indirect consumables business, focused on vendor-managed inventory and vending solutions, are aiding the Service Center Based Distribution segment. Strong performance and backlog conversion in industrial and off-highway mobile fluid power solutions markets, as well as sustained customer Maintenance, Repair, and Operations (MRO), are aiding the Engineered Solutions segment.Expansion Efforts: AIT has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. The Advanced Motion Systems Inc. (AMS) (April 2023) buyout expanded the company’s footprint in the upper Northeast region of the United States while helping to bolster relationships with leading suppliers. The acquisition of Automation, Inc. (November 2022) expanded Applied Industrial’s footprint across key verticals and geographies while supplementing its value-added services and cross-selling efforts. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023), buyouts had a positive impact of 0.7% on the company's sales. For the Engineered Solutions segment, acquired assets boosted sales 2.2% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter.End Market Strength: Solid momentum in the end markets, including chemicals, food and beverage, utilities, energy, and pulp and paper end markets, driven by MRO activity and capital spending on process infrastructure, is aiding the company.

The card needs to be registered in the Mercedes me user account, consequent to which customers can leverage a fingerprint sensor, which will be integrated into the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system. The MBUX display has been built with the power of innovative technologies and serves as a means to ensure seamless interaction between the users and vehicles.Therefore, fingerprints can now be put to use for completing hassle-free and safe digital fuel bill payments across Germany. The reach of such convenient payments is likely to be expanded to other vehicle-related services and across other European markets in the days ahead. The removal of the need to feed a PIN or authenticate payments through mobile device at the point of sale ensures a hassle-free in-vehicle experience.And this lucrative opportunity to make online payments from cars has been made possible by the integration of Mastercard Secure Card on File for Commerce Platforms technology into the automaker's car models. The technology makes use of uniquely assigned cryptograms to encrypt transaction data, thereby assuring the confidentiality of sensitive payment information.The recent launch reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to extend modernized payment solutions to boost the uptake of digital payments in the everyday lives of its consumers. And this time, the focus of MA remains to simplify the car driver’s journey across several European markets.In this manner, an enhanced digital suite of Mastercard, built through constant tie-ups and significant investments, is likely to help in establishing a solid presence across the digitally booming continent. And the presence of a worldwide trusted company like MA will encourage more consumers to adopt newer forms of digital payments in their daily experiences and activities.Story continuesThe increased uptake of Mastercard’s solutions may fetch higher revenues to the tech giant. Also, attaching a highly beneficial contactless payment facility to the tech giant’s card offerings suite in Germany is expected to prompt more nationwide customers to opt for MA’s cards and subsequently, expand its cardholder base.Shares of Mastercard have gained 40.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s 24.8% growth.

Sourced from recycled and renewable feedstocks, these +LC solutions are designed to support businesses in meeting their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals while maintaining high-quality applications essential for modern, sustainable living by offering a lower carbon footprint than fossil-based alternatives.""Sustainability is woven into the fabric of our business strategy,"" noted Kimberly Foley, executive vice president, I&amp;D and Refining at LyondellBasell. ""The +LC solutions mark a critical step for our customers as they increasingly shift towards more ambitious GHG emissions reduction targets and product circularity. These low-carbon solutions will use renewable, bio-based and recycled feedstocks that empower our customers to reduce their Scope 3 GHG emissions.

The mass balance approach enables renewable and recycled feedstock to be attributed to the final product when these feedstocks are blended with conventional raw materials in the production process. Moreover, Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) data are available for these products, enabling businesses to directly compare the carbon footprints of +LC solutions with traditional fossil-based counterparts. By opting for +LC products, businesses can now seamlessly integrate sustainability into their operations without compromising performance, reflecting a balanced approach to meeting both functional needs and sustainability objectives.The +LC solutions are currently available in Europe and the Americas, and plans for expansion into Asia are set for early 2024.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Vulcan Materials, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.088 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$14b - US$793m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Vulcan Materials has an ROCE of 8.8%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 9.9% average generated by the Basic Materials industry. Check out our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Vulcan Materials compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Vulcan Materials.What Can We Tell From Vulcan Materials' ROCE Trend?There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Vulcan Materials. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 8.8% and the business has deployed 50% more capital into its operations. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.Story continuesOur Take On Vulcan Materials' ROCEIn summary, Vulcan Materials has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 89% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Vulcan Materials and understanding this should be part of your investment process.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

674,8c37c768-ad13-3aa9-b2ae-ac8a2de6d9e0,CINF,2023-09-28,3 Growth Stocks to Pick From the Top-Ranked P&C Insurance Space,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-stocks-pick-top-152100192.html,1695741660,STORY,['CINF'],"[The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry is placed within the top 27% of the 255 Zacks industries. Industry players are poised to benefit from improving pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, streamlined operations, strong global presence and a solid capital position. It currently carries Zack Industry Rank #65.The industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively increased 30.5% in a year compared with the Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s increases of 13.6% and 19.2%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the bright prospects of the industry, growth stocks like Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. KNSL and Skyward Specialty Insurance Group, Inc. SKWD, banking on their fundamental strength, should generate better returns.The industry has been witnessing improving pricing, albeit at a slower pace. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 23 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last 10 quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Analysts at Swiss Re Institute predict premiums to grow 7.5% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2024. Per reports published in Carrier Management, direct premiums written across the P&amp;C business in 2023 are estimated to grow in double digits. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.The performance of P&amp;C insurers is affected by catastrophic events. Colorado State University estimated an above-normal 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, about 130% of the average season. CSU named 18 storms, including nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes.Swiss Re estimated a global economic loss of $120 billion in the first half of 2023 from natural disasters, while insured losses were estimated to be about $50 billion. Per a report in the Insurance Journal, the combined net ratio in 2023 is estimated to be 102.2. Underwriting losses are expected to be primarily due to soft performance in personal lines, which, in turn, is driven by higher catastrophe losses per Insurance Information Institute and Milliman.Though P&amp;C insurers’ financials are less sensitive to interest rates than life insurers, a better interest rate environment will cushion investment income. The Fed has already made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 11 since March 2022. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.The insurance industry continues to witness accelerated digitalization. Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies.A sturdy capital position supports effective capital deployments like investment in organic growth initiatives, mergers and acquisitions, dividend hikes, special dividends and share buyback programs. Story continues Growth PicksGiven the prospects of the industry, let’s look at a few stocks that have the potential to generate better returns. Our proprietary Growth Score makes the daunting task easier.The Growth Score analyzes the growth prospects for a company. Studies have shown that stocks exhibiting the best growth characteristics consistently outperform the market. Back tested results have shown that for stocks with a solid Growth Score and a favorable Zacks Rank, the returns are even better.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected four P&amp;C insurance stocks with an impressive Growth Score of A or B. Each of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.These stocks have also witnessed positive estimate revisions in the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the companies’ operational efficiency.Fairfield, OH-based Cincinnati Financial markets property and casualty insurance.

CB, Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Cincinnati Financial Corp. CINF, Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. AXS and ProAssurance Corp. PRA.Industry: Property &amp; Casualty InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2155020/5-property-casualty-insurers-to-buy-with-improving-pricingThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance (P&amp;C) industry is likely to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting and exposure growth. Industry players like Chubb Ltd., Arch Capital Group Ltd., Cincinnati Financial Corp., Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. and ProAssurance Corp. are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last 10 quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety.Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. Also, the Fed has already made four hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 11 since March 2022. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. Insurers implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 23 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last 10 quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently.Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners' premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.Analysts at Swiss Re Institute predict premiums to grow 7.5% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2024. Per reports published in Carrier Management, direct premiums written across the P&amp;C business in 2023 are estimated to grow in double digits.Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profits. Swiss Re estimated a global economic loss of $120 billion in the first half of 2023 from natural disasters, while insured losses were estimated to be about $50 billion. Per a report in the Insurance Journal, the combined net ratio in 2023 is estimated to be 102.2.Underwriting losses are expected to be primarily due to soft performance in personal lines, which, in turn, are due to higher catastrophe losses per Insurance Information Institute and Milliman. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With a sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech creating competition for incumbent players. Insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk. The use of technology also poses cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates rosy prospects in the near term.

677,b20847b3-5a96-3847-af00-8955d7530cb4,GE,2023-09-28,Should Investors Buy General Electric or General Mills Stock Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-buy-general-electric-general-000000233.html,1695772800,STORY,"['GE', 'GIS', '^GSPC']","[Adding industry conglomerates to the portfolio is typically a sound decision and seeing if General Electric GE or General Mills GIS fit the bill is a worthy conversation.General Electric’s diversified operations including aerospace and healthcare instantly make the company an option as a multi-sector conglomerate with General Mills being a global leader among consumer food manufacturers and expanding into pet products as well. Let’s see if it’s time to buy stock in either of these iconic companies as investors look for buy-the-dip candidates amid recent market volatility.Recent Performance &amp; Valuation General Electric’s stock is up +31% this year to top the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq while General Mill’s stock has dropped -22% on fears of slower consumer food spending as the company continues to lose its pandemic mojo.To that point, General Mill’s stock is now only up +9% over the last three years to also trail General Electric’s +122% with GE being boosted by the rebound in air travel strengthening its aerospace segment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, General Mills makes a stronger case for value trading at $65 a share and 14.4X forward earnings. This is attractively beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 20.9X and well below General Electric’s 49.1X with GE shares trading at $109.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; OutlookIn regard to their outlooks, the bottom-line expansion of General Electric and General Mills is attractive but both companies are seeing slower sales growth.General Electric’s earnings are expected to dip -13% this year but rebound and soar 90% in fiscal 2024 at $4.31 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to drop -19% in FY23 but stabilize and rise 9% in FY24 to $67.31 billion. With that being said, FY24 sales projections would be a 15% decrease over the last five years with 2020 sales at $79.61 billion.   Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTurning to General Mills, annual earnings are expected to be up 4% in its current FY24 and rise another 5% in FY25 at $4.72 per share. Total sales are projected to rise 3% in FY24 and edge up another 1% in FY25 to $21.01 billion. Despite the slowing top-line growth, FY25 projections would be a 16% increase over the last five years with sales at $18.12 billion in General Mills' fiscal 2021.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividendsGeneral Mills' dividend currently has the advantage over General Electric. GIS’s annualized dividend growth over the last five years is 2% for a current yield of 3.64% compared to GE’s modest 0.29%. General Electric’s dividend has declined -13% over the last five years on efforts to reserve capital following the pandemic.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayAt the moment General Electric and General Mills stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). General Electric’s strong price performance in correlation with its FY24 earnings outlook is very intriguing while General Mills' valuation and dividend are rewarding for longer-term investors. This makes holding stock in both conglomerates attractive although there could still be better buying opportunities ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

678,9b002bc9-203a-32b0-915e-9cd41553bf1b,GE,2023-09-28,General Electric Company's (NYSE:GE) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-companys-nyse-ge-140012033.html,1695736812,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric's (NYSE:GE) stock is up by 6.5% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to General Electric's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for General Electric How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:33% = US$11b ÷ US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.33.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.General Electric's Earnings Growth And 33% ROETo begin with, General Electric has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 21% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 57% net income growth seen by General Electric over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared General Electric's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 52% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is GE worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GE is currently mispriced by the market.Is General Electric Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?General Electric's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.4%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, General Electric has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 6.4% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 16%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that General Electric's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

679,ff13bc7c-dcda-3b20-886f-c62bae99674f,VLO,2023-09-28,Calculating The Fair Value Of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-valero-energy-120028829.html,1695816028,STORY,['VLO'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Valero Energy fair value estimate is US$131Valero Energy's US$142 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Analyst price target for VLO is US$150, which is 15% above our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.36bUS$4.88bUS$3.90bUS$3.92bUS$3.46bUS$3.21bUS$3.06bUS$2.98bUS$2.95bUS$2.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -11.56%Est @ -7.45%Est @ -4.57%Est @ -2.55%Est @ -1.14%Est @ -0.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$5.9kUS$4.1kUS$3.0kUS$2.8kUS$2.3kUS$2.0kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.2%) = US$46bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$46b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$20bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$46b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$142, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.295. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Valero EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

EL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 20, 2023 $90.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Estee Lauder shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Estee Lauder is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Cosmetics industry that ranks in the Bottom 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 12 cents per share to a loss of 21 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Estee Lauder right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

687,fec9c40f-3069-3f18-8500-3b222dc1be72,EL,2023-09-28,The 7 Most Undervalued S&P 500 Stocks to Buy in September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-p-500-182452370.html,1695234292,STORY,"['USB', 'VZ', 'WFC', 'KHC', '^GSPC', 'EL']","[Investors wanting to buy good quality S&amp;P 500 stocks at great prices should consider the following seven stocks. Even better, Morningstar analysts have assigned 5-star ratings to all seven of these picks, indicating that each is severely undervalued.S&amp;P 500 Stocks: U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) sometimes flies under the radar compared to some of the country’s other too-big-to-fail banks. But at a market cap of more than $50 billion, USB stock firmly slots in among the nation’s dominant financial institutions.The company operates on a national scale and has leading positions in fee-generating businesses such as mortgage originations, trusts, wealth management, and payment processing. The bank has also stood out due to its unmatched efficiency. It routinely scores among the best-run large banks in terms of key operating metrics such as efficiency ratio and return on equity. It spreads that wealth with its shareholders; USB currently pays a 5.51% dividend yield.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile the stock has underperformed — thanks. to a slowdown in business lines, such as mortgage lending — these are short-term concerns. With a good deal of negativity priced in, investors can pick up USB at a discount.Wells Fargo (WFC)Dividends Are the Best Reason to Hold Wells Fargo StockSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of America’s largest banks. It has a diversified business model, operating both the nation’s fourth-largest bank by assets along with its large investment banking division.The firm ran into dramatic problems with its fake account scandals at the end of the 2010s. However, the bank cleaned up shop, replacing the management team and letting a bunch of people go. Wells Fargo has paid huge fines and done other work to remediate the situation. Despite turning over a new leaf, WFC stock remains in the penalty box. Investors seem fixated on the bank’s past issues and its elevated costs related to legal expenses for that matter. However, as these things clear up, Wells Fargo’s true value will become apparent.Story continuesShares are trading around the same price they did a decade ago, even as the bank has grown its size and earnings power considerably. This leaves the firm at 8x today’s earnings and an even cheaper multiple once its earnings power normalizes in the coming years. Throw in a chunky share repurchase program, and the upside could be dramatic.S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Verizon (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is a steady blue-chip telecom. Income investors have long relied upon VZ stock for its outsized dividends. To that point, Verizon currently offers a tremendous 7.8% dividend yield. Verizon shares have fallen sharply over the past couple of years. This has come amid rising competition, a heavy 5G spending cycle, and the negative impact of higher interest rates.Investors have feared the worst and are worried that Verizon might follow peer AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) in cutting its dividend. However, Verizon’s profits have been stable; the company earned a tremendous $21 billion over the past 12 months. Shares trade at just seven times forward earnings.Notably, management believes that it’s past the peak of its spending related to 5G and other enhanced infrastructure and that costs will fall and cash flow rise in 2024. That makes shares a bargain ahead of this turn in the company’s trajectory. Morningstar’s Michael Hodel believes VZ shares are worth $54 each, which would represent more than 50% upside from today’s price.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is one of the world’s largest cosmetics companies. The firm initially saw a massive rise in its stock price as people latched onto it as a global economic reopening play. Naturally, people leaving the lockdowns wanted to look their best when returning to social functions.However, that momentum has long since passed. After a series of disappointing earnings reports, driven by profound weakness in the Asian market, EL stock has full-on crashed. Shares are down from a peak of more than $350 per share to just $154 today.Is that warranted? Probably not. Analysts still project Estee Lauder to grow revenues at 6% this year despite the poor results in various international markets. Meanwhile, revenue growth is expected to accelerate again in 2024 with earnings surging as well. Shares go for just a projected 22x 2025 earnings, which is a more than fair price for a luxury company like this with such a successful track record.S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comKraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) is one of the world’s largest packaged food companies. The firm appeared to be on top of the world a decade ago as it was building a global conglomerate funded by 3G Capital’s aggressive leverage and cost-cutting approach.However, Kraft’s business went stale as management arguably failed to invest enough in marketing and innovation. This left Kraft with a struggling product line-up as consumers wanted more fresh and interesting food offerings.That said, Kraft could be set for a resurgence. With the rise in inflation and consumers looking to save money, Kraft Heinz’s cost- and value-focused business model could find renewed resonance with customers. And, if nothing else, Kraft’s ruthless cost efficiency positions it well for dealing with a prolonged period of rising input and labor costs. With the recent drop, KHC stock is deep into value territory. Shares go for 12 times forward earnings and offer a nearly 5% dividend yield.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a leading triple-net REIT. Triple nets are a type of real estate trust where the tenant — rather than the landlord — pays key expenses such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance. These fare well in inflationary environments as the landlord isn’t on the hook for sharp increases in those costs.Regardless of this advantage, O stock has sold off along with the rest of the REIT industry. Higher interest rates are scaring investors. For one, REITs such as Realty Income have to pay higher interest expense on their debts going forward. For another, with higher interest on risk-free fixed-income investments, investors demand more yield from their dividend stocks.That said, with O stock down 18% over the past year and hitting fresh new 52-week lows in September, this has become an overreaction. Shares now yield 5.5%. And Morningstar’s Kevin Brown sees fair value up at $76, a considerable increase from today’s $55 price.Albemarle (ALB)Lithium element on the periodic table. Undervalued Lithium StocksSource: tunasalmon / ShutterstockAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is one of America’s larger specialty chemical companies. In recent years, it has focused on lithium, with its lithium production operations spanning the United States, Australia, and Chile.It’s no secret that the world will need far more lithium in the future to build all the batteries that will power electric vehicles.That said, ALB stock has sold off in 2023. Traders have dumped Albemarle and other lithium companies because the price of lithium has slumped as a result of weak demand from the Chinese market. That’s a short-term headwind but will make little difference to the firm’s fundamental value. Shares go for less than seven times forward earnings today.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ALB, EL, VZ, and WFC stock.

(NASDAQ:ADP) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$98b last week. However, the 6.5% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Automatic Data Processing. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Automatic Data Processing?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Automatic Data Processing. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Automatic Data Processing's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Automatic Data Processing is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.2% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Automatic Data ProcessingThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$87m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Automatic Data Processing. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Automatic Data Processing better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

(NYSE: SLG), New York City’s largest office landlord, together with its joint venture partners, today announced that One Madison Avenue, the 1.4 million-square-foot, premier office tower located in Manhattan’s Midtown South submarket, secured its Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO) on September 15, 2023, completing the development three months ahead of schedule.

(NYSE:DHI) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-107-time-put-d-110058304.html,1695898858,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$131 and falling to the lows of US$107. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether D.R. Horton's current trading price of US$107 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at D.R. Horton’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton Is D.R. Horton Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 7.44x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 7.87x, which means if you buy D.R. Horton today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe D.R. Horton should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because D.R. Horton’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will D.R. Horton generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of D.R. Horton, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 1.8%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in DHI’s growth outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at DHI? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DHI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

698,badacbbf-a14b-3004-be77-b31691a756d3,DHI,2023-09-28,Homebuilder stocks feeling the heat after rising rates,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/homebuilder-stocks-feeling-heat-rising-204057173.html,1695847257,VIDEO,"['LEN', 'LEN-B', 'DHI', 'PHM', 'XHB']","[The current interest rate environment is driving mortgage rates higher, which in turn are having their own effect on homebuilder stocks, such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), and PulteGroup (PHM). Many stocks across the homebuilding sector have been noted to be in a downturn since the Federal Reserve's rate pause last week.Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joins the show to break down how these stocks are performing amid elevated volatility.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, the rising rate environment driving mortgage rates above 7%. And while low inventory has supported homebuilder stocks, the reality of high rates is now weighing on shares. Jared Blikre is down on the floor right below us with details on this. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hi, Julie. There are some strange things going on in the market. To your point earlier in the show, this is what's happening on the Wi-Fi Interactive today in the homebuilders market. And you can see some red, some green there. But it's pretty clear, over the last seven days, lots of dark red here. Most of these tickers down about 5% like Toll Brothers, Lennar. DHI as well.And this includes that federal reserve meeting where we saw interest rates shoot higher. This is a 10-year-- this goes back to Wednesday last week. And you can see, from that meeting to here, we have risen quite a lot. And I think all of this will make a lot more sense if we look at the 30-year mortgage rate, which I have right here in cyan along with XHB. And that is the S&amp;P-- that's the S&amp;P homebuilders market.So here, we had these low rates in 2020, 2021. We saw this huge rise in XHB. Lots of fundamental reasons for that over the pandemic. Lots of people moving their residences. Then we saw an inverse relationship take hold, where we saw these rising rates-- 1, 2, 3. And then 1, 2, 3. We saw the opposite reaction in the homebuilders.Story continuesAnd then on this latest spurt up in the homebuilders, that was done actually with rising rates here. Why would that be? I think it's because we've put in this top here, and then we backed off of it. And we didn't really see XHB. We didn't see the homebuilders take a hit until we broke to new highs. And that was very recently, actually about a month or two ago in this market that we're looking at.So I'm going to go back to our heat map. And I'm going to show the price action. This is over the last seven days. I want to show what's happened over the last month, because it gets even worse there. Here's two months. And you can see the drops from those highs. DHA-- DHI down about 15.8%.And just to your point, Julie, on the strange things going on in this market, when we have a market where one thing goes up and the other thing is supposed to go down, doesn't always happen on a daily basis. But you take the price action and the overall indices today. They seem to have gone up in the middle of the day-- in the middle of the day, retracing all their losses for no rhyme or reason.It's because of the enhanced volatility in the market. It gets into short gamma, really in the weeds. I'm not going to go there. But just to say that things are a bit more volatile and hinky than they have been in several months. So probably more of the same into the end of the month.JOSH LIPTON: All right. Thank you, Jared Blikre, for bringing us all the action from the floor of the NYSE.]"

(NYSE:BRK) used to own shares of STORE Capital Corp., a REIT specializing in single-tenant operational real estate (STORE).In September 2022, STORE Capital announced that it would be acquired by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and Oak Street in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $14 billion. Shares soared 20% on the news.Berkshire exited its position in STORE Capital in 2022. According to the latest 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there's no publicly traded REIT in Buffett's portfolio.But that doesn't mean Buffett has given up on real estate.

Here's how to collect $1,000 per month from Buffett's favorite dividend stock.D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Berkshire's 13F filing revealed that it bought 5,969,714 shares of D.R. Horton in the second quarter of 2023. At the current share price, the stake is worth $645.4 million.Headquartered in Arlington, Texas, D.R. Horton is America's largest homebuilder by volume. It operates in 33 states and has a diverse product portfolio with sale prices ranging from $200,000 to over $1 million. The company also builds and sells single-family rental and multifamily rental properties.In the fiscal quarter that ended June 30, D.R. Horton's consolidated revenue increased 11% year over year to $9.7 billion. Homes closed grew 8% to 22,985, while net sales orders rose 37% to 22,879 homes.Story continuesNet income, on the other hand, decreased 19% from a year ago to $1.3 billion for the quarter.D.R. Horton shares initially surged after Berkshire revealed its stake but later retraced those gains. Nevertheless, the shares have risen over 19% in 2023.Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN)Lennar is another heavyweight player in the home construction business.Established in 1954, Lennar builds homes in various markets across the country. It delivered 66,399 homes in fiscal 2022.In addition to its core homebuilding operations, the company offers financial services, including mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services.In the third quarter of Lennar's fiscal 2023, which ended Aug. 31, its revenue from home sales slipped 2% year over year to $8.3 billion. The decline was because of a 9% decrease in average sales price, partially offset by an 8% increase in the number of home deliveries.Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said, ""Short housing supply, absorbed by strong primary and pent-up demand, continued to define a strong sales environment.""Berkshire acquired 152,572 Lennar shares in the second quarter, a position valued at $17.3 million today.NVR Inc.

With NVR shares trading at $6,232, the stake is worth $69.2 million.NVR constructs and sells homes under the brands of Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes. It also has a building products division, a mortgage subsidiary and a settlement and title services subsidiary.In the second quarter, new orders for NVR's homebuilding business increased by 27% year over year to 5,905 units.

Plus, fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to leap another 16%. On the top line, sales are expected to be up 11% this year and rise another 1% in FY24 to $56.82 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInternational LeaderPivoting to United, the airline has the largest international exposure with over 130 destinations worldwide and 215 locations in the U.S. United’s earnings are anticipated to rebound and skyrocket 333% in fiscal 2023 to $10.92 per share compared to EPS of $2.52 last year. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rise another 3%.Total sales are expected to jump 19% this year and rise another 6% in FY24 to $56.95 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDomestic LeaderLastly, American has the largest domestic share in the market flying to around 350 locations domestically and more than 60 countries worldwide.American’s earnings are now projected to rebound and catapult 476% to $2.88 per share compared to EPS of $0.50 a share in 2022.

Total sales are expected to rise 8% this year and edge up another 5% in FY24 to $55.66 billion.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation ComparisonIn addition to their attractive growth recovery, all three of the major airliners stand out in terms of price-to-earnings valuation and make the case for being undervalued in this regard.United sticks out the most trading at just 3.9X forward earnings which is a 54% discount to the Zacks Transportation Airline Industry average of 8.6X and well below the S&amp;P 500’s 20X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, Delta and American also trade at attractive discounts to the industry and benchmark trading at 5.7X and 4.4X forward earnings respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom LineAt the moment all three of the big airline stocks land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). There could be more short term risk associated with broader market volatility and the resurgence of inflationary pressures on travel. However, Delta, United, and American Airlines stock are making a strong case for being undervalued at their current levels, and holding on to them should be rewarding as they offer various exposure to domestic and international markets.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, from a first glance at American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for American Airlines Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$5.2b ÷ (US$67b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, American Airlines Group has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Airlines industry average of 8.2% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for American Airlines Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering American Airlines Group here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?There hasn't been much to report for American Airlines Group's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if American Airlines Group doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On American Airlines Group's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to American Airlines Group's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Since the stock has declined 66% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.Like most companies, American Airlines Group does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.While American Airlines Group isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The aviation sector is anticipated to be the hardest hit, with the possibility of essential workers being required to work without pay.Yahoo Finance Live is joined by Boyd Group International President Mike Boyd to discuss the implications for consumer travel and the challenges that may arise for the Federal Aviation Administration.""Overall, it's just going to accelerate a decline in the efficiency of our air transportation system... also issues of oversight of airlines, oversight of airports, oversight of manufacturers and components,"" Boyd says. ""That's where the real sand might get into the works.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: A government shutdown would have dramatic implications for the US travel economy, with some estimates putting the hit at around $140 billion a day. The aviation sector is a key focus. While many essential staff like air traffic controllers are expected to report for duty without pay, workers calling in sick could be an issue yet again.We want to bring in Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. And, Mike, lay this out for us because estimates are all over the place and exactly what a government shutdown-- the impact that is going to have on the travel industry. What's your view?MIKE BOYD: Well, I think initially, air travel will be just as inconvenient as ever. We have understaffed air traffic control systems right now and the employees know they're going to get paid eventually. The real issue is long term.And it's not just things like training. [? Buddha Air ?] brought that up. That really won't come into play. What really will come into play is the day-to-day regulation that the FAA has over airports, airlines, and also aircraft manufacturers, where Boeing won't be able to get that inspector to take a look at that new system they want approved on an airport. And Eastern Wyoming won't be able to get an FAA inspector to come and look at the New runway. Over a period of time that could have a hit.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Would this also impact some infrastructure projects, especially, given the environmental reviews permitting that would be disrupted and some of these infrastructure projects taking place in or around or at airports?MIKE BOYD: It would. In the near term it certainly wouldn't have much of an effect because it's only going to be several days probably. But nevertheless, in terms of hurting the environment, that's not going to be the case. I don't think, per se. It'll just-- you shut down the whole air transportation system, that's a lot less jet fuel going into the air.But nevertheless, the bottom line of the whole thing is the FAA is in a situation right now where it needs to get reorganized and revisited. We've got new electric airplanes coming along line that are really heading for a brick wall regulation wise. We really can't take these people off of those jobs because thats critically important. You and I don't see that. But in five years-- in five weeks, five months, we probably will.SEANA SMITH: Mike, what about the traveler's behavior? Do we typically see people maybe canceling their trips if we see a government shutdown?MIKE BOYD: I think people that don't really look into it, probably would assume, yes, if the government shuts down, my airplane might shut down. Let's not go see grandma right now. There'll be some of that. But I think overall at least if this doesn't last more than a couple of-- more than a week or so, we're not going to see a whole lot of anything.I don't see a walkout. I don't see people calling in sick. These controllers and TSA people, they know they're going to get paid. It's just going to be a little late paycheck and there might be something after accelated when it comes.BRAD SMITH: Certainly, and that was the case back in 2019, where we did see absenteeism on the rise, especially, after that two week period because of delayed paychecks. Now, what kind of impact would that mean for the airline operators should we get to that point?MIKE BOYD: Well, right now, today, our air traffic control system has been a wonderfully bipartisan, mismanaged thing over the last 20 years. So I don't think we're going to see anything missing right now. But overall, it's just going to accelerate a decline in the efficiency of our air transportation system, mainly because of the ATC system. But also issues of oversight of airlines, oversight of airports, oversight of manufacturers and components, that that's where the real sand might get into the works.BRAD SMITH: And, so, as you were mentioning earlier, it also impacts the safety checks therein. So what type of resumption would we be talking about thereafter?MIKE BOYD: Well, I don't think we'll see anything with safety. Look, the airline industry today, they know that safety is really expensive. So you're not going to have that problem. But getting back on, we bring up a real good point.When you shut something down, getting it back. Getting that FAA inspector back to take a look at that new system that a component manufacturer is putting together might take weeks. So it'll delay a lot of things and will hurt some companies. There's no question about it because it won't be able to produce the systems they want to produce or develop them, that sort of thing.It could be again-- that's where you got these billions of dollars and millions of dollars a hit-- it's not people getting on the airplane at gate seven at LaGuardia.BRAD SMITH: All right, Mike Boyd, Boyd Group International President. Mike, always a pleasure to get some of your insights and analysis around this. We'll hope that we don't get to that point. But you may be getting another call from us.MIKE BOYD: I'd love to. Thank you, sir.]"

(NASDAQ:ORLY) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about O'Reilly Automotive. See our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About O'Reilly Automotive?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that O'Reilly Automotive does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of O'Reilly Automotive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in O'Reilly Automotive. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.0% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of O'Reilly AutomotiveWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$558m. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for O'Reilly Automotive (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Focus on pricing and cross-selling actions, and growth initiatives augur well for the company.Let’s delve into the factors, which make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a smart investment choice at the moment.Segmental Strength: Robust growth across the U.S. Service Center network and indirect consumables business, focused on vendor-managed inventory and vending solutions, are aiding the Service Center Based Distribution segment. Strong performance and backlog conversion in industrial and off-highway mobile fluid power solutions markets, as well as sustained customer Maintenance, Repair, and Operations (MRO), are aiding the Engineered Solutions segment.Expansion Efforts: AIT has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. The Advanced Motion Systems Inc.

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023), buyouts had a positive impact of 0.7% on the company's sales. For the Engineered Solutions segment, acquired assets boosted sales 2.2% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter.End Market Strength: Solid momentum in the end markets, including chemicals, food and beverage, utilities, energy, and pulp and paper end markets, driven by MRO activity and capital spending on process infrastructure, is aiding the company. The company’s investments to expand automation, industrial Internet of Things, digital offerings and customer development initiatives are expected to drive its growth.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments. In fiscal 2023, it paid out dividends worth $53.4 million, up 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. The company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 2.9% in January 2023.Northbound Estimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIT’s fiscal 2024 (ending June 2024) earnings has been revised 1.1% upward.Price Performance:  Shares of AIT rose 57.3% in a year, outperforming the industry‘s 22.6% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Caterpillar Inc.

Let’s take a closer look at each.DaVitaDaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the U.S. to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with expectations creeping higher across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company sports a solid growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 10% on 2% higher revenues in its current year. Peeking ahead, estimates for FY24 allude to a further 6% earnings boost paired with a 2.5% sales bump.And DaVita plans to extend its footprint, providing further runways for growth. The company has been steadily expanding in international markets and expects to expand in major European and Asian countries through acquisitions and partnerships.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company posted a big beat in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 25% and delivering a 2% sales surprise. In fact, the company has beaten consensus EPS expectations by an average of 21% across its last four releases.Walmart Many are familiar with the titan Walmart, with its product portfolio covering nearly every aspect of retail and being known for relatively low prices. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across all timeframes, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncome-focused investors could be attracted to WMT shares, currently yielding a respectable 1.4% annually. And the company has shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, with the payout growing a modest 2% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company recently upped its FY24 guidance following robust quarterly results, with strong sales growth and continued business momentum providing solid tailwinds.AflacAflac, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. The company has seen modest positive earnings estimate revisions among all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike DVA, Aflac has consistently posted bottom line results above expectations, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 8% across its last four releases. Just in its latest print, Aflac posted an 11% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 15% above the consensus.In addition, the company is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrats group, reflecting its commitment to shareholders through a minimum of 25+ years of increased payouts. AFL shares currently yield a solid 2.2%, with a payout ratio sitting sustainably at 30% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd shares aren’t valuation stretched given its forecasted growth, with earnings forecasted to climb 13% in its current year. Shares presently trade at a 12.8X forward earnings multiple, a few ticks above the five-year median but nicely below highs of 13.8X in 2022.Bottom LineAdding low-beta stocks can be a great way to counter volatility, as these stocks are less sensitive to the market’s overall movements. And with volatility creeping higher as of late, investors could be looking for a shield.For those interested in a more conservative approach, all three low-beta stocks above – DaVita DVA, Walmart WMT, and Aflac AFL – could be solid considerations.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting optimism among analysts.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Similarly, the Dow and the Nasdaq finished at their lowest levels since Jul 10 and Jun 7, respectively.The possibility of a partial government shutdown has been stoking fears among investors. If Congress is not able to strike a deal on a dozen spending bills by the end of this week, the U.S. government is likely to get shut down.Scores of government workers won't get their paychecks, thereby injecting a fresh doze of uncertainty into the economy. By the way, traditionally, the stock market saw a lot of volatility in the days leading up to the government shutdown.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s intention to hold interest rates high is also weighing on stocks. This is because an increase in interest rates decreases the present value of a company’s future earnings.Also, the cost of borrowing rises and consumer outlays decrease as interest rates increase, which doesn’t bode well for economic growth.In its recently concluded policy meeting, the Fed said it intends to hike rates by another 25 basis points by the end of this year to curb elevated inflation, which is still hovering way above the central bank’s target of 2%. The Fed has also hinted at keeping interest rates higher for longer in 2024 (read more: Fed Anticipates Higher Rates for Longer: 5 Big Winners).Thus, with the government shutdown and rate hike concerns looming and the stock market subjected to bouts of volatility, it’s prudent for investors to place bets on dividend aristocrats like Caterpillar CAT, Abbott Laboratories ABT, McDonald's MCD, Aflac AFL and Automatic Data Processing ADP for steady income.

While the stock has lost 7.5% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why AWK Could Bounce Back Before LongThe RSI reading of 28.57 for AWK is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering AWK in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, AWK currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for American Water Works Company:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.053 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$29b - US$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, American Water Works Company has an ROCE of 5.3%.  On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 4.5% generated by the Water Utilities industry, it's much better. View our latest analysis for American Water Works Company roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for American Water Works Company compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering American Water Works Company here  for free.So How Is American Water Works Company's ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at American Water Works Company, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 6.7%, but since then they've fallen to 5.3%. However it looks like American Water Works Company might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOur Take On American Water Works Company's ROCETo conclude, we've found that American Water Works Company is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 60% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.If you'd like to know more about American Water Works Company, we've spotted   4 warning signs,  and 1 of them can't be ignored.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

These companies are mainly known for their financial stability and the ability to generate consistent cash flows, which allows them to sustain and grow their dividend payments even during economic downturns. While dividend stocks haven't performed as well as the overall market this year, their attractiveness and advantages are pulling investors back toward them. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has gained 0.04% this year so far and its 12-month returns came in at 9.27%, as of September 25.One of the main reasons for the growing appeal of dividend stocks is the power of compounding. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividends have played a vital role in the profits investors have made over the past 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total gains in the S&amp;P 500 Index can be traced back to the practice of reinvesting dividends and the power of compounding. The report also mentioned that between 1930 and 2022, dividend income typically made up 41% of the total return from the S&amp;P 500 Index.Dividend stocks are mainly defensive. Despite everything that has occurred this year, such as the regional banking issues, it's important not to overlook how well the Aristocrats performed last year. They had a negative return of 6.5%, which was much better than the S&amp;P 500's negative return of 18%. Furthermore, the Aristocrats also offered some protection from the bond market's significant losses in various asset categories. In 2022, when investors were concerned about the stock valuations, high dividend funds did well because they offered attractive yields to income-seeking investors.Story continuesAlso Read: S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Analyst RatingsSimeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, spoke to Barron’s about the benefits of dividend aristocrat stocks, which include their history of raising dividends, financial stability, and solid cash generation. He also highlighted that in the second quarter, while earnings for companies in the S&amp;P 500 decreased by nearly 6% compared to the previous year, the Aristocrats saw an average earnings increase of about 10%, according to Bloomberg data. Here are some remarks from the analyst:“The ability [of the Aristocrats] to grow those earnings in an earnings recession and the ability to crank that out without using a lot of capital is the tangible benefit of quality.”Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in PEP?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.48.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:18% = US$4.3b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo begin with, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 20% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 23% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is REGN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Dupixent will be the first and only FDA-approved treatment for EoE in children of this age group if approved.Last year in May, Sanofi/Regeneron’s Dupixent received FDA approval for treating EoE in individuals aged 12 years and older. Following this approval, the drug became the first-ever approved treatment in this indication.The sBLA filing is based on data from the phase III EoE KIDS study, which evaluated Dupixent in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE. The study achieved its primary endpoint of histological disease remission following 16 weeks of treatment with the drug. Data from the study also showed that treatment with Dupixent maintained histologic remission for 52 weeks, a secondary endpoint. The drug is yet to be approved anywhere for treating EoE in children aged under 12 years.Shares of Sanofi have risen 12.2% in the year compared with the industry’s 5.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron’s stock has gained 15.7% year to date against the industry’s 16.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA blockbuster drug, Dupixent is a key topline driver for Sanofi and Regeneron. Apart from EoE, the drug is currently approved in the United States and Europe for four other type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, and prurigo nodularis. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications and expansion in younger patient populations expected, its sales are likely to be higher.In first-half 2023, Sanofi recorded €4.9 billion (around $5.3 billion) from Dupixent product sales, indicating a 36.7% year over year growth. Sanofi expects Dupixent to achieve more than €13 billion in peak sales and €10 billion in 2023.Story continuesDupixent is being jointly marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the drug’s global sales. Both companies are also studying the drug in late-stage studies in a broad range of diseases driven by type II inflammation, like bullous pemphigoid and chronic spontaneous urticaria.Like Sanofi/Regeneron, many large-cap pharma giants like Bristol Myers BMY and Pfizer PFE are also developing their own pipeline candidates for treating EoE.Bristol Myers is currently evaluating its investigational IL-13 inhibitor, cendakimab, for treatment of EoE in a phase III registrational study. Pfizer is also evaluating its oral S1P modulator etrasimod in a mid-stage study to treat EoE. However, both the Bristol Myers and Pfizer candidates are still at least a couple of years away from regulatory approval and potential commercialization, which is likely to provide Dupixent with an edge in the EoE indication.Sanofi Price Sanofi PriceSanofi price | Sanofi Quote Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

732,792fcb38-15d8-3b63-96f3-5e37c4188a8b,UNP,2023-09-28,7 Long-Term Stocks That Should Be on Every Investor’s Radar This Fall,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-long-term-stocks-every-113051953.html,1695382251,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'LMT', 'DIS', 'UNP', 'MSFT', 'COST']","[With increased volatility rocking the markets this year, it’s more important than ever for investors to ensure their portfolios are allocated across a balanced mix of stable, blue-chip stocks and higher growth opportunities. While the majority of your holdings should be devoted to established, dividend-paying companies, I believe carving out a portion for reasonably-priced growth stocks with long growth runways can enhance overall returns. The key is finding a personalized balance of low-risk, slow-and-steady stocks and selectively picking faster-growing companies poised to outperform over the long term.This fall, there are seven stocks I have my eye on that I believe have the potential to generate market-beating returns over an extended time horizon while still being responsibly valued.Rather than chasing extremes, I recommend investors build a firm foundation with established names that will stand the test of time. Allocating a portion to reasonably-priced innovators and market leaders expanding within secular growth trends can provide outsized growth to complement a core of sturdy blue chips. A balanced approach focused on enduring quality and growth at a reasonable price has the potential to yield strong returns for patient investors this fall and for years to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that said, here are seven long-term stocks to buy this Fall.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comA conglomerate led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) provides broad exposure to a diversified collection of mature businesses as well as a massive $147 billion cash pile to be deployed opportunistically. Berkshire’s operating businesses, including insurers like GEICO and General Re, BNSF Railroad, and industrial manufacturers, deliver consistent earnings, enabling Berkshire to generate ample free cash flow.Story continuesBerkshire can then allocate this cash between stock buybacks, acquisitions, and its equity portfolio of market leaders, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BOA), and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). With Buffett at the helm, investors benefit from being passively invested alongside the world’s greatest capital allocator and his proven strategy of buying wonderful companies at fair prices. Berkshire’s financial strength and flexibility allow Buffett to make big long-term bets in turbulent markets when others are paralyzed. With over $1 trillion in total assets, Berkshire’s portfolio also grants investors diversification across sectors.The company’s financials are also stellar, but given Berkshire’s status as a holding company, these financials aren’t easily comparable to its peers. That said, most investors remain very confident about Berkshire, even during turbulent times. Thus, hold BRK stock and let Buffett do the money making for you.Since we are talking about the long-term here, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger may not be around for the entirety of your holding period. But they have built an excellent portfolio and a management team that can keep Berkshire Hathaway running in the same fashion for decades to come.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comWith military budgets ramping up significantly across NATO counties in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) finds itself well-positioned to capitalize on surging demand. As a preeminent global aerospace and defense contractor, Lockheed Martin produces advanced weaponry and cutting-edge combat systems, including the ubiquitous F-35 fighter jet.In its latest quarter, Lockheed Martin grew sales by 8% and achieved a record backlog, demonstrating strong fundamental momentum. Critically, nearly two-thirds of Lockheed Martin’s backlog consists of orders from the U.S. Department of Defense and Congress, granting high visibility into future revenues. It has now swelled to $158 billion.Looking ahead, Lockheed Martin expects to deliver steady mid-single-digit growth in sales through 2027, driven by restocking military inventories, allies increasing defense budgets, and classified aviation programs. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin’s triple-A balance sheet supports consistent dividend growth and facilitates further strategic acquisitions. With military conflict regrettably now top of mind for Western governments, Lockheed Martin is well-positioned to fortify national security while producing durable returns for shareholders.Ammo, Inc. (POWW)a photo of some guns and ammunitionSource: ShutterstockThe surge in geopolitical conflicts has created unprecedented pressure on global ammunition supplies, with U.S. allies dramatically increasing orders to rebuild depleted inventories. Ammo, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWW) is a niche small-cap company focused on designing, manufacturing, and selling high-performance ammunition and components that are perfectly leveraged to ride this wave. While Ammo, Inc.’s stock has retreated over 78% from 2021 highs during the broad market correction, the company just delivered a profitable quarter after four straight losses.Importantly, Ammo, Inc. is strategically shifting its business mix toward higher-margin brass casings for OEM channels and away from lower-margin finished ammo. With stronger fundamentals and leaner operations, Ammo, Inc. believes it can expand gross margins significantly from current levels.Meanwhile, Ammo, Inc.’s gunbroker.com online marketplace continues gaining traction and introducing new technology improvements. Though still facing macroeconomic headwinds, Ammo, Inc. is making the right moves to improve profitability and capture surging ammunition demand as markets recover. After declining from euphoric levels, you can purchase this micro-cap supplier at a bargain valuation before sentiments improve. The consensus price target of $3 implies 48% upside potential for AMMO stock over the next year.Union Pacific (UNP)United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comThe United States possesses the largest rail network in the world, spanning nearly 160,000 miles across the country and transporting 40% of America’s freight each year. However, much of the rail network consists of industrial lines dedicated to transporting raw materials rather than passenger transit, meaning its importance often goes unrecognized. This is where Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) comes in. As one of the largest Class I railroads with 32,500 route miles covering 23 states, Union Pacific is a stalwart of U.S. industry, connecting businesses across the country.I have mixed feelings with this stock. On the positive side, Union Pacific has grown revenues substantially and currently has over $24 billion in annual sales. Importantly, Union Pacific converts a quarter of those sales into free cash flow, enabling a secure dividend with a 2.5% yield. The company has raised its dividend annually for 16 consecutive years, and I believe this is a cash cow that’ll deliver solid total returns if you keep reinvesting those dividends and cash out.However, the company’s recent dip in revenue and earnings, combined with concerns about labor, are driving bearish sentiment with this stock. In response, UNP stock has pulled back, but I believe the negatives are more than priced in right now. Union Pacific’s sales and profits are expected to rebound next year, with revenue and earnings per share expected to grow between 5% and 10% annually for the foreseeable future. As for labor concerns, unemployment is already showing signs of increasing, and with the rise of undocumented migration from the south, I don’t believe UNP will feel too much of a pinch.Walt Disney (DIS)Walt Disney logo on mobile phone with Cinderella's castile in backgroundSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comDisney (NYSE:DIS) has seen its stock price decline dramatically, falling over 56% from its March 2021 peak. However, the company’s robust collection of assets and brands, including Marvel, Pixar, ESPN, and its theme parks, position it well for the long-run once macroeconomic headwinds subside.Disney is undergoing a significant restructuring led by returning CEO Bob Iger to focus on streaming and improving cost efficiencies. Though the transition brings near-term pain as linear networks face cord-cutting pressures, Disney’s unrivaled IP and global reach provide ample opportunities ahead. Its theme parks business continues to perform well, while new Disney+ subscription tiers with ads aim to improve the economics of the company’s streaming business.With the stock trading at just over 23-times forward earnings, Disney seems attractively valued for long-term investors. Its trailing price-to-earnings multiple has not been this low since 2015. Once economic conditions improve, pent-up demand for experiences like travel and theme parks should benefit Disney even more. Buying Disney at today’s levels could yield a significant upside over time for investors with a long time horizon.Analysts expect the company’s top line to expand by 6% annually through 2028, and believe its earnings per share can pull off 33% growth next year. Notably, analysts also expect earnings per share growth to hold just below 20% through 2027.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comCostco (NASDAQ:COST) has been one of the best-performing retail stocks, with its share price up over 24% year-to-date while many retail peers have tumbled. Its membership model provides resilient revenues, and the company’s focus on value has helped its bottom line during this period of high inflation.With renewal rates recently hitting all-time highs around 93%, Costco can selectively raise membership fees while opening new warehouse locations to drive growth. Its subscription-based business is recession-resistant, while growth initiatives in e-commerce, healthcare, travel, and business services present further upside.Trading at 39-times forward earnings, Costco does merit a premium valuation given its strong performance, but I don’t think its too much of a negative. Over the past five years, it has grown earnings per share at an 16.6% annualized pace. Costco operates with razor-thin margins, but makes up for it with sheer volume and scale. With over 118 million member households worldwide, Costco has substantial purchasing power to secure great deals and pass savings to customers.I believe Costco has proven adept at adapting to economic conditions and changing consumer behaviors. It provides a low-risk way to invest in resilient staples like food and gas, while also benefiting from discretionary purchases as wages rise. Can it sustain the current trajectory in the stock market? Probably not. But if you’re in it for the long-run, it is worth waiting through any near-term pain since you’re also getting a small 0.7% dividend yield.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the only tech stock on this list, but that’s because Berkshire Hathaway already provides wide exposure across Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and other tech giants. However, Berkshire does not hold Microsoft, a diversified technology leader firing on all cylinders across software, hardware, cloud, AI, and more futuristic pursuits like quantum computing.Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform sees strong growth as digital transformation continues, while new initiatives in AI with its ChatGPT integration and metaverse technologies providing massive growth runways. And then there’s Windows and Microsoft Office, both of which are something that the white-collar sector cannot live without.With a reasonable valuation of 30-times forward earnings, I believe Microsoft is a blue chip worth buying and holding for decades, given its broad capabilities and innovative roadmap. Over the past year, Microsoft generated over $59.4 billion in free cash flow, providing resources to invest in more high-growth tech. Analysts still expect Microsoft’s top line to expand by over 10% on average this decade.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Disney (NYSE:DIS), for example, plummeted as consumers ditched cable television. Top retail stocks took a hit as they lost market share to online competitors.

But that’ll happen when a stock reaches stellar heights, as BKNG has done. CEO Glenn Fogel, for example, sold about $2.4 million worth of stock. Chief Financial Officer David Goulden also sold about $1.8 million worth of stock. Also, unlike many names in the travel space, BKNG stock is not trading at a low valuation. In fact, it trades at 19x forward earnings, which isn’t too far from where the S&amp;P 500 trades.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDelta Airlines (DAL)a Delta (DAL) plane flying through the cloudsSource: NextNewMedia / Shutterstock.comDelta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) has apparently been dragged down by the travel slowdown, and higher oil prices. The latter, of course, will increase the firm’s costs and lower its profits.Story continuesGiven these points, it’s not surprising that the airline recently cut its third-quarter earnings per share guidance to $1.83 to $2.05 from $2.20 to $2.50. In addition, DAL now expects its revenue per available seat mile to fall 2% to 3% year-over-year this quarter. Although the company reiterated its full-year earnings per share guidance of $6 to $7, I believe that this outlook could very well be too optimistic at this point. At a minimum, its EPS is likely to come in towards the low end of the range.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Comcast (CMCSA)Keeping NBC News on the Air Could Hamper Comcast StockSource: ShutterstockAt first glance, Comcast’s (NYSE:CMCSA) second-quarter results appear okay. For example, its top line climbed 1.6% year over year. Meanwhile, net income,  advanced 4.8% year over year. Most of those increases were reportedly driven by the reopening of company theme parks.Unfortunately, Comcast’s other, steadier businesses delivered rather discouraging results. Most worrisome for CMCSA stock was the 0.4% YOY decline in the revenue of its Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms business and the net loss by that business of 65,000 of its customers last quarter. That unit encompasses the firm’s broadband internet and cable TV offerings.In addition, competition from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and other telecom companies is starting to meaningfully erode Comcast’s broadband Internet unit. All while its cable TV business continues to lose customers. Also, the revenue of its media business was little changed year over year. We also have to consider that consumer cord-cutting won’t exactly help the stock moving forward either.Home Depot (HD)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukAs I pointed out in a previous column, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is being hurt by a low number of homes being sold due to the current, elevated interest rates.  Indeed, last quarter, HD’s comparable sales sank 2% year over year, while its operating income tumbled a rather discouraging 8.6%. I don’t see much improvement in the foreseeable future, especially with seasonally adjusted housing starts down 11.3% in August, year over year.While I do expect the Fed to cut interest rates early next year, it will likely take until the middle or end of next year for home starts and home sales to rebound meaningfully. By that time, HD stock is likely to have fallen a great deal.Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell: Gap (GPS)Source: ShutterstockSome may quarrel with my inclusion of Gap (NYSE:GPS) on a list of blue-chip stocks. But the company’s Gap and Old Navy stores are quite ubiquitous in the U.S., making the country a top brick-and-mortar realtor. As a result, I think that GPS does qualify as a blue-chip stock. Last quarter, the company’s comparable sales tumbled 6% year over year. Online sales sank 11%. In addition, GPS reported that  Old Navy, which used to be a pillar of strength for the firm, suffered “a comparable sales drop of 6%.” Gap also expects its revenue to dive at least 10% during the current quarter.Clearly, the company’s offerings are just not resonating with consumers, and/or it’s being eaten alive by its competition. GPS has to figure out how to turn its business around. And until it does so, GPS is clearly one of the blue-chip stocks to sell now.Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLike Gap, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is one of America’s top apparel retailers. Unfortunately for JWN and its peers, analysts, on average, expect U.S. apparel sales to climb only 1% during the upcoming holiday season.Nordstrom’s sales tumbled 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Excluding the closure of its Canadian operations and the timing of a key sale, its revenue would have declined “only” 4% year-over-year, the firm reported. Still, the retailer expects its revenue to sink 4% to 6% year-over-year in Q3, showing that its performance is not likely to improve anytime soon. Also noteworthy is that its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped to $192 million from %$202 million in Q2 of 2022.As with Gap, Nordstrom appears to be losing a significant amount of market share and has to find a way to turn itself around.Whirlpool (WHR)Source: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.comClearly, appliance maker Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) is, like Home Depot, being badly hurt by the low number of home sales. Whirlpool is, of course, being hurt by the trend because people who move into new homes often buy new appliances for them, while builders add new appliances to the houses that they’ve created.Whirlpool’s top line sank 6% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while its operations burned $370 million of cash, nearly the $180 million that its operations used during the same period a year earlier.Until home sales show signs of starting to recover meaningfully, WHR stock is unlikely to advance much and could very well drop a great deal. Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the section on HD, I don’t expect home sales to start recovering until the middle of 2024 at the earliest.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

737,cd62fc2b-2a55-3322-bff4-718ad3f5eb3a,CSCO,2023-09-28,"Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) Looks Like A Good Stock, And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-100831055.html,1695895711,STORY,['CSCO'],"[It looks like Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Cisco Systems investors that purchase the stock on or after the 3rd of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.39 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.56 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Cisco Systems has a trailing yield of approximately 2.9% on its current stock price of $53.2. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Cisco Systems's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Cisco Systems can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Cisco Systems paid out a comfortable 50% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 33% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Cisco Systems's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Cisco Systems has grown its earnings rapidly, up 167% a year for the past five years. Cisco Systems is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Cisco Systems has increased its dividend at approximately 11% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayIs Cisco Systems an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that Cisco Systems is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.Wondering what the future holds for Cisco Systems?

738,a9f8a48a-d20d-360d-b1ea-784fbcacf26b,CSCO,2023-09-28,AI will translate into 'real business' and ROI benefits: Nutanix CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-translate-real-business-roi-161938684.html,1695831578,VIDEO,"['NTNX', 'CSCO']","[Nutanix, Inc. (NTNX) shares trend higher this morning on the cloud service provider's upbeat guidance on revenue growth and profitability. Nutanix CEO Rajiv Ramaswami sits down with Yahoo Finance from the Nasdaq MarketSite to discuss the provider's multi-cloud hybrid business model and its views on artificial intelligence.AI is ""going to be a long-term trend,"" Ramaswami says. ""There's a lot of buzz right now about AI... being trained in the public cloud. At the end of the day, just like with everything else, people are going to have to realize good ROI [and] TCO benefits with AI.""Ramaswami also comments on the cloud company's partnership with Cisco (CSCO).For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Nutanix shares are on the move this morning. You're seeing them move higher by about 4% after the cloud company gave investors something to smile about, expecting annual recurring revenue growth of 20% by 2027 and projected profitability ahead of prior targets. For more on this, we're joined by Rajiv Ramaswami who is the Nutanix CEO. Thanks so much for taking the time here with us today.RAJIV RAMASWAMI: Great to be here live with you guys, Brad and Seana. I've done a lot remotely, and it's great to be here live in the studio, so.BRAD SMITH: I've in living color here in Times Square for sure here. We got to talk about what you guys unveiled and talked about at the investor day yesterday, and really the street latching on to this updated guidance. What propelled you guys to really-- and led you guys to bring that type of guidance out to investors, and the confidence that went into that?RAJIV RAMASWAMI: Yeah. So just to quickly recap the financial model that we talked about, the medium term financial model over the next three years, we said we were driving to be a $3 billion ARR company, subscription company, software company at scale driving 20% approximately CAGR for ARR growth between now and then, and driving $800 million roughly of free cash flow.Story continuesSo driving strong, durable growth while increasing profitability. And that is, of course, well received by investors. But let me talk about the drivers behind that. So fundamentally, we've done a lot of work over the last few years to go through our subscription transformation. And we are largely done with that, and now, scaling.And as you look at what that is, we are also exposed to some key trends in the market. Companies are now running apps and data everywhere. It's not just one location, not just public cloud, not just data centers. And we are the best platform to enable that to happen. So that's a good long-term trend here that we are benefiting from in terms of being the platform for companies doing that.There's also a few other things happening in the marketplace. We've all talked about AI and that's a good-long term driver. As companies build more AI applications, we can help them run those AI applications wherever they'd like to run, right?SEANA SMITH: Yeah. How much of a driver is that for you?RAJIV RAMASWAMI: It's a long-term driver. It's people are just getting started now with Jenni AI. We've had some legacy applications running on our platform for a while, but Jenni AI is a whole new thing. And people are experimenting. And I think we'll go from experimenting to real production probably over the next few years.A couple of other trends quickly, our largest competitor is being bought, and we are the most viable easiest, simplest alternative to them. And of course, we just announced some new partnerships. I'm excited about the one that we just announced with Cisco, where they are focused on selling our products and no longer selling their own.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Investors are excited about that too. I mean, we saw that come out, and one of the analyst notes early this morning that was cited. Also cited was expense controls for the company, no expiry buyback plan, tucked in acquisitions. So all of these things considered, investors might be right to think to themselves right now, OK, so what the heck is hybrid multi-cloud? And why should we still care about that within our portfolio?RAJIV RAMASWAMI: Great question. So it fundamentally comes down to what companies are doing. They're going digital. And when they go digital, the lifeblood is all about applications and the data that they consume. And everybody, you guys are a tech company, right, doing broadcasting. And every company is becoming a software company, and it's all about the app.And they need a platform to run these apps. And they're going to run everywhere. Some of them are going to be in public cloud, some of them are going to be in data centers. Some of them are going to be running in factory edges and retail stores. And they need a platform. This is what we call hybrid cloud, or hybrid multi-cloud, which is these apps and data are everywhere. And they need a platform to run these apps on. That is precisely what we do.SEANA SMITH: And the partnership that you have with Cisco, going back to what you just said a moment ago, and focusing a little bit more on that, just how is that taking shape? I know you just announced it about a month ago, but what does this also tell investors and tell Wall Street just about the direction of Nutanix and where you see the company in three to five years from now?RAJIV RAMASWAMI: Yeah. I mean, we see the company as scale subscription company, but truly with a broad ecosystem of partners. And that's really how we go to market. That's how we partner, that's how we meet customer demand. At the end of the day, customers are looking for a complete solution.Now, if you look at the Cisco piece in particular, it's great for customers because they trust Cisco. And here, we have a highly integrated solution that delivers everything in one place, right, delivered by Cisco vendor they trust. It's great for Cisco because they're now selling our market leading solution in the marketplace. It's great for us because it expands our routes to market. I'm excited about it.BRAD SMITH: You said AI is huge for you. When do you see that delivering significantly for your bottom line?RAJIV RAMASWAMI: Yeah, I think that's going to be a long-term trend here. We just introduced our AI solution literally a couple of months ago here. And customers, like I said, companies are still trying to figure out how to get these AI applications. There's a lot of buzz right now about AI, large language models being trained in the public cloud.At the end of the day, just like with everything else, people are going to have to realize good ROI TCO benefits with AI, right? It has to count. And so investments have to provide a return. And we're going to see the same thing happen with AI as well over the next few years as real commercial applications get deployed.SEANA SMITH: I'm curious, as someone within this space obviously, and you've had an exposure now to AI for quite some time, what do you make of all the hype all of a sudden around AI, and what we've seen surrounding generative AI, and how many investors, how many companies are now even just mentioning AI in their earnings calls?RAJIV RAMASWAMI: Yeah, I mean, I think it's just--SEANA SMITH: This is good news for you.RAJIV RAMASWAMI: It's good for us. From our perspective, we look at it as, hey, here's a whole new set of applications that companies are going to build that use AI. And guess where they would run? Well, we'd love for them to run on our platform, and we are a good platform to run those. So that's how we look at it.But clearly again, there is a cycle here, right? There's a lot of interest. There's a lot of buzz. There's a lot of experimentation going on now. And then over time, that's going to translate to real business being delivered with real results being delivered. And that's when it becomes a sustainable thing. And I do think it's going to be a sustainable long-term play for many companies.BRAD SMITH: Just lastly while we have here, Nutanix shares are up 16% over the past month. It's been a tough month for some of the tech stocks out there as we're taking a look at the NASDAQ composite down over the past month by about 4%. So you think about what this has meant for you, the announcement with Cisco, the partnerships. You were mentioning Micron even before we came on here. How significant is this in terms of the-- not just annual recurring revenue that you're expecting, but the growth perspective for a company like Nutanix?RAJIV RAMASWAMI: I truly believe this is our time as a company. You know, we've done all the hard work. And now, we're starting to see the fruits of everything we did over the last few years here in terms of building a long-term company at scale, sustainably growing $3 billion plus of ARR in three years from now, highly profitable in that time period, meeting the needs of-- critical needs of customers who are looking to run apps and data. So we're excited about our long-term future. And you're seeing that reflected in some of our stock over the last month.SEANA SMITH: Rajiv Ramaswami, great to have you. Thanks so much for hopping on here with us in person at the NASDAQ. CEO of Nutanix, thanks again.RAJIV RAMASWAMI: Thank you very much.]"

This year's theme was ""We Can. We Will,"" focusing on an action to drive a more sustainable future together. Participants used the full week of more than 400 scheduled events as a rallying call to halve carbon emissions by 2030 and to be on a path to net-zero by 2050.Cisco and the Cisco Foundation, along with our Climate grantee and investee partners, understand that the sustainable future we want to move towards is one that is inclusive, resilient, and regenerative. Together, we focus on innovation as a key avenue to foster more inclusive communities, more resilient bioregions, and circular and regenerative economies. That is why we asked some of our grantee and investee partnership leaders, ""How does it benefit your organization to participate in Climate Week, and what are you looking forward to most about the event?"" This is what they had to say.Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps""The climate crisis disproportionately affects the communities Mercy Corps works with - people facing poverty, conflict, environmental degradation, and more frequent and unpredictable extreme weather. And the individuals most impacted by climate change have often contributed the least to it.We partner with local communities on climate solutions, from adaptation to sustainable energy, that bring practical, meaningful change at the local level, then mobilize our global team to scale and replicate them worldwide.Climate Week is an opportunity for us to learn from peer and partner organizations, build new partnerships, and unlock new ideas and opportunities for collaboration across sectors to tackle the greatest threat of our time.No single organization can solve the complex issues facing the world today - and it will take all of us, across all sectors to advance the climate action our world needs now. This is why we champion partnerships that bring together expertise, ideas, tools, and resources in support of the shared goal of creating a better world - that's what we're most looking forward to.Story continuesThe new commitments, ideas, and partnerships that come out of Climate Week will make a difference in protecting our planet and people already experiencing the consequences of the climate crisis.""Lance Pierce, CEO of NetHope""NetHope‘s participation in Climate Week is bigger than just building awareness. The crux of our Climate Interactions program lies in our community of humanitarian and preservation organizations, their ecosystems, thematic initiatives, local and marginalized communities, and technology partners. Our vision is to help minimize or reduce the impact of climate change on vulnerable people through more effective and innovative use of digital technologies for resilience and adaptation. NetHope is a consortium of leading global nonprofits with over 60 nonprofit Member organizations who collectively serve over 1.67 billion people in 190 countries, and more than 50 corporate technology partners that collaboratively work to tackle global challenges by leveraging digital solutions.NetHope believes we can help reduce or minimize some of the shorter-term impacts of climate change by leveraging the combined experience and knowledge of our community. The catastrophic threat posed by climate change, with the potential to nullify decades of humanitarian advancement, has catapulted it to one of the 5 top priorities we have at NetHope and is shared by our humanitarian and conservation Members.Tackling the climate crisis, requires bold, collective action. NetHope looks forward to Climate Week, to COP28, and beyond, working with likeminded partners to help leverage the reach of the NetHope community via digital, data, and partnerships to help more people in more places in the face of certain climate change.""Kelly Erhart, Co-founder and President of Vesta""Vesta looks forward to the solutions-oriented and connective nature of Climate Week.Vesta's strength as an organization comes from the immense cross-sector collaboration we have mobilized to advance Coastal Carbon Capture as a nature-based carbon removal solution.Climate Week offers a unique opportunity to connect with corporates, investors, technical experts, and other organizations in the space to advance industry knowledge and workshop solutions to key development blockers.Climate Week is a vital touch point for Vesta with the larger environmental community and offers unparalleled opportunities for us to establish additional partnerships in order to advance Coastal Carbon Capture along its path to becoming the most scalable, cost effective, and energy efficient form of permanent carbon removal.""Cecilia Foxworthy, CEO of Agora Partnerships""Participation in Climate Week helps Agora Partnerships be on the vanguard of climate technologies, innovations, and models as we develop our Cisco Foundation-supported digital repository of eco innovations for SMEs in Latin America.These spaces of interchange where the climate is at the center of discussions, are of extreme importance to our organization, not only to learn from the titans and innovators of the industry but also to share our point of view and ensure the challenges and opportunities related to climate in Latin America are being talked about.We look forward to meeting old partners we've worked with over the years, and to meeting new friends as we exchange ideas and collaborate to protect our planet and all its beings.""Deborah Stern, Co-Founder of Capital for Climate""Capital for Climate's purpose is to guide and accelerate capital allocation to achieve a net zero, nature positive, just transition. With Cisco Foundation's partnership, we're creating the world's most comprehensive Nature-based Solution (NbS) Investment Platform - powering the network of NbS opportunity-focused investors to confidently allocate with the right data, tools and community. Mobilizing capital to Brazil's NbS is one urgent focus.""Climate Week - gotta love it. It offers an amazing crucible to make mission-critical connections - from white-board sessions with our closest collaborators (some we've never met in person!), to forming new relationships at a myriad of events.Exposed to a wealth of information, people, projects, we get to see an ever-richer map of the ‘tribe' and to tap into the stream of emerging narratives … that can…that will…that are…speeding our collective success.On the flip side - Climate Week can be utterly dizzying. So, I plan my agenda, but especially look forward to the serendipities that often yield remarkable connections, enabling quantum leaps for my work and our collective mission.""Eric Berlow, CEO of Vibrant Data Labs""Vibrant Data Labs (VDL) is proud to be on the ground for Climate Week this year and our mission is clear: help all the disparate hands that are working on the existential crisis of our time, come together to collaborate more effectively and strategically toward global climate justice outcomes.VDL has been requested as a featured presenter alongside leading climate finance investors, philanthropists, scientists, and movement builders. At these events, we will showcase how we bring our unique ecological perspective and novel data science approaches to building tools that lead to greater collaboration across the climate change ecosystem.Throughout the week, we will have the opportunity to engage with our long-time partners in person, meet new leaders, and learn from the field.We hope to bring a rare combination of science and hope as we all look forward to the challenges ahead. Being present at Climate Week will help VDL continue to understand and define the biggest impact role our team can have in this growing field.""Nicole Etchart, Co-Founder and CEO of NESsT""This year, during Climate Week, NESsT will collaborate with leaders from various sectors across the Amazon, including government representatives, Indigenous and traditional communities, investors, and local businesses, to launch the Pan-Amazonian Network on Bioeconomy.At the event, we will collectively present the recommendations generated by 300 participants and 100 institutions who took part in the Belem Panamazonia Bioeconomy Conference on June 21st and 22nd, 2023. The launch aims to underscore the importance of conserving the Amazon and promoting sustainable development, with a specific focus on climate-smart approaches that strengthen biodiversity and involve traditional communities in the region.As part of the Pan-Amazonian network on Bioeconomy, NESsT seeks to amplify the voices of Indigenous and traditional communities in the bioeconomy and connect more local, environmentally conscious businesses in the rainforest to sustainable markets.Through the NESsT Amazonia Initiative, we currently support a portfolio of 48 enterprises that are driving bioeconomy solutions and enhancing the well-being of traditional communities while safeguarding the environment. This portfolio encompasses a diverse range of solutions, from Indigenous-led initiatives supporting Amazon River fishers to early-stage tech companies dedicated to delivering and expanding climate solutions in the Amazon.""Katherine Lucey, Founder and CEO of Solar Sister""Attending Climate Week is a great opportunity to engage with diverse stakeholders involved in climate justice. Solar Sister emphasizes women's crucial role in implementing and adopting clean energy solutions, especially in rural and underserved areas, and we are deeply committed as a key player in the intersection of climate change, women's empowerment, and clean energy. By showcasing how women's economic empowerment and clean energy go hand-in-hand, Solar Sister underscores the message that tackling climate change and gender inequality is a synergistic effort.Climate Week provides a prominent platform to amplify the importance of Solar Sister's mission to a global audience. Attending offers a good opportunity to meet with potential partners, donors, and other stakeholders to foster collaborations, funding opportunities, and new initiatives. Additionally, Climate Week is an excellent forum to learn valuable insights into the latest technologies, best practices, and policies in the clean energy sector from other industry leaders and innovators.As CEO of Solar Sister, I look forward to leveraging the opportunities that Climate Week offers to advance our mission, foster collaborations, and inspire greater change in the fight against climate change and gender inequality.

For software companies, which historically have been active acquirers, the sector's solid 2023 in the public markets could start to make room for M&amp;A again as rate hikes ease and companies look for inorganic growth to buy and build on.""Software stocks have had a great year thus far ... outperforming the S&amp;P 500 up 13%,"" Thill wrote.

Though it's possible to do deals in high interest rate environments, more expensive capital can put a damper on some excitement.Additionally, getting giant deals over the finish line remains tough. Even though Cisco and Splunk will likely be able to squeak by, it isn't exactly a winning regulatory landscape for other deals at this scale.""From a regulatory perspective, we see limited risk given minimal product overlap (within the observability portion of Splunk's portfolio) though we would be remiss not to acknowledge today's regulatory environment and the impact that could have on timing of deal closure,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick on Sept. 22.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.
