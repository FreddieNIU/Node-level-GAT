By utilizing genetics, personalized medicine aims to identify and treat patients in a way that is more specific to their needs.

The disease was responsible for causing nearly one in six deaths, or around 10 million deaths, in 2020.In addition to the rising incidence of chronic diseases, advancements in technology and the utilization of genetic databases are also acting as key drivers for the personalized medicine market and the genomics market. Experts think the application of precision medicine is expanding across multiple medical specialities, such as neurology, antiviral, and pulmonary.

Here’s what the firm said:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), an American multinational computer software firm, announced its Q2 2023 financial results on June 15. The company reported a non-GAAP EPS of $3.91 and a revenue of $4.82 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.12 and $50 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 database, Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight. On May 25, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported an FQ3 non-GAAP EPS of $3.43, beating market consensus by $0.12. The revenue of $53.65 billion, however, fell short of Wall Street estimates by $930 million. Net sales for the quarter grew 1.9% to $52.60 billion, up from $51.61 billion in the prior-year quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 66 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 861,306 shares worth about $428 million. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

The dividend is distributable on July 3, to shareholders of record on June 16. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Index Weight: 0.664454%AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an American pharmaceutical company that ranks 23rd on the S&amp;P 500 index based weight.

(NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Index Weight: 0.695779%PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks, with an index weight of 0.69%. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc.

The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is likely to be approved for obesity in 2023. Lilly has two new obesity drugs advancing into Phase 3 trials. Lilly also has a drug in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease.

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 19.5 million shares worth $2.14 billion. Here is what First Eagle Investments said about Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”12. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:JPM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

Here is what the fund said:“Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10.

UnitedHealth Group was hurt in the quarter as initial rate proposals for Medicare Advantage managed care were more negative than hoped. Fortunately, the final reimbursement rates announced after the quarter are not nearly as ominous.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

(NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7.

Harris Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”27. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Index Weight: 0.606184%Pfizer Inc.

(NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”26. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight. On May 25, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported an FQ3 non-GAAP EPS of $3.43, beating market consensus by $0.12. The revenue of $53.65 billion, however, fell short of Wall Street estimates by $930 million. Net sales for the quarter grew 1.9% to $52.60 billion, up from $51.61 billion in the prior-year quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 66 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 861,306 shares worth about $428 million. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

The dividend is distributable on July 3, to shareholders of record on June 16. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Index Weight: 0.664454%AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an American pharmaceutical company that ranks 23rd on the S&amp;P 500 index based weight. On April 27, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $2.46, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.03. The revenue of $12.23 billion came in line with market consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared to 73 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest position holder in the company. Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Index Weight: 0.695779%PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks, with an index weight of 0.69%. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc.

Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.65 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about PepsiCo, Inc.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $21.60 billion. Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”20. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:MRK), compared to 77 funds in the earlier quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.8 million shares worth $298.4 million. Aristotle Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Founded in 1891 and headquartered in New Jersey, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms. The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation.

Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Index Weight: 0.855603%Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), the American multinational fintech corporation, ranks 18th on the S&amp;P index based on weight.

Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company. Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million. Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Inverse Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.""It's Like They Don't Care About The Debt Ceiling Negotiations At All""In a recent episode of Mad Money, aired on May 23, Jim Cramer discussed the surprising market reaction to the ongoing debt ceiling talks and provided insights into the sectors that may be impacted if the government defaults on its debt. According to Cramer, despite the potential risks, the market showed resilience as investors focused on growth stocks and seemingly brushed off the concerns surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations.Cramer highlighted the noteworthy performance of companies that reported poor earnings but showed strong potential for future growth. Tech stocks, particularly cybersecurity stocks, remained in demand despite debt ceiling concerns. The market's response indicates that investors believe these companies will continue to thrive, even in the face of a potential crisis.On the other hand, consumer packaged goods companies that have historically rallied during periods of economic uncertainty, experienced a downturn. This divergence in performance suggests that the market is not heavily influenced by concerns about a debt ceiling impasse and remains optimistic about the overall economy. Though the market is not optimistic about these stocks, Cramer thinks these stocks ""are in the sweet spot, even if we crash through the debt ceiling deadline"".Cramer also discussed industries that would likely be impacted if the government were to default on its debt obligations. First, he highlighted that the real estate sector could suffer due to the anticipated rise in long-term interest rates, potentially making mortgages unaffordable. Additionally, banks would face uncertainty and may struggle as well. Utilities and companies heavily reliant on credit, such as those in the heavy machinery, aircraft parts, and auto sectors, could also experience temporary setbacks.Story continuesCramer is known for his outspoken opinions on stocks, and he often makes bold predictions about the market. However, not everyone agrees with Cramer's picks. In fact, some investors believe that the best way to make money in the stock market is to do the opposite of what Cramer says. That's where the Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) comes in.The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) is an actively managed exchange-traded fund designed to generate returns that are opposite to the investment outcomes of Jim Cramer's recommended investments, prior to accounting for fees and expenses.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”26. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Index Weight: 0.664454%AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an American pharmaceutical company that ranks 23rd on the S&amp;P 500 index based weight.

Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest position holder in the company. Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Index Weight: 0.695779%PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks, with an index weight of 0.69%. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Founded in 1891 and headquartered in New Jersey, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms. The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Index Weight: 0.855603%Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), the American multinational fintech corporation, ranks 18th on the S&amp;P index based on weight.

Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company. Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million. Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is likely to be approved for obesity in 2023. Lilly has two new obesity drugs advancing into Phase 3 trials. Lilly also has a drug in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease.

(NYSE:V) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of global payment network Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) increased after reporting strong quarterly results, with 19% growth in revenue and EPS despite currency headwinds and the suspension of operations in Russia. Payment volume grew 16% in local currency (excluding Russia and China) with notable strength in cross-border volumes driven by rebounding international travel. Management also provided encouraging guidance for the next fiscal year. We continue to own the stock due to Visa’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”13. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Index Weight: 1.133553%Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ranks 13th on the S&amp;P 500 index.

The company also raised and extended its share repurchase program up to $35 billion in 2023-2024.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 73 hedge funds were long Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared to 79 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 19.5 million shares worth $2.14 billion. Here is what First Eagle Investments said about Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”12. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Index Weight: 1.136872%JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:JPM), compared to 100 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest position holder in the company. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Index Weight: 1.164214%Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the American multinational healthcare corporation, is one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks by index weight.

Here is what the fund said:“Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)10.

UnitedHealth Group was hurt in the quarter as initial rate proposals for Medicare Advantage managed care were more negative than hoped. Fortunately, the final reimbursement rates announced after the quarter are not nearly as ominous.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Index Weight: 1.648476%Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) operates insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses worldwide. It ranks 9th on the S&amp;P 500 index. In Q1 2023, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)’s operating earnings increased 13% year-over-year as insurance underwriting and investment income skyrocketed. The company also repurchased approximately $4.4 billion of its common stock during the first quarter, up from $2.6 billion in Q4 2022. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 108 hedge funds were bullish on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 110 funds in the preceding quarter. Here is what Black Bear Value Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 220Index Weight: 1.7168%With an index weight of 1.71%, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 8th on the S&amp;P 500. On April 26, the tech giant reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $2.20 and a revenue of $28.65 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.23 and $990 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 220 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 194 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 8 million shares worth $1.70 billion. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Index Weight: 1.727553%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with an index weight of 1.72%, ranks 7th on the S&amp;P 500 list. These are class C shares, and shareholders have no voting rights. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $1.17 and a revenue of $69.79 billion, topping Wall Street consensus by $0.10 and $950 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 155 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 152 funds in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 204Index Weight: 1.996184%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 6th on the S&amp;P 500 index, with an index weight of nearly 2%. GOOGL shares are class A shares and allow one vote per share. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 204 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), compared to 209 funds in the last quarter. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

14,52c1d4a2-a375-3751-aef2-fe66ee5a0e88,SIG,2023-06-25,7 Value Stocks to Dump Before They Decline Even Further,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-value-stocks-dump-decline-232926795.html,1687130966,STORY,"['MRNA', 'DISH', 'AAP', 'NTR', 'SIG', 'ALLY']","[The key to making profits in the markets has been to buy large-cap growth stocks, and sell value stocks. At least, that’s what it seems like, when you take into account that the surge of the S&amp;P 500 index year-to-date is largely attributable to big gains among big tech stocks. Although not for certain, this trend could continue in the near-term. Ongoing economic issues like high inflation, high interest rates, and slowing economic growth are keeping value stocks at depressed prices.Meanwhile, secular growth trends like artificial intelligence (or AI) are helping to counter these macro headwinds when it comes to tech sector heavy-hitters. That said, while there is merit in going contrarian in some of these declining value stocks today, for their strong rebound potential tomorrow, keep in mind that this is not universal. There are scores of “value traps,” that may be at risk of experiencing further declines. This is due mostly to weak fundamentals, that more-than-counter their respective low valuations.That said, as the market remains in a “sell value stocks” state of mind, consider now the time to exit all positions in these seven low-quality value plays.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAdvance Auto Parts (AAP)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinWhen it comes to avoiding stock losses, it may seem to0 late to raise a red flag with Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP). As you may know, shares in the auto parts retailer took a serious dive on May 31, falling by 35% that day alone. Investors bailed on AAP stock, on the heels of the company’s quarterly earnings report. With results falling far short of estimates, and with management not only cutting outlook, but slashing the dividend by 83%, it’s no surprise shares experienced such an epic price decline. However, even after this massive price drop, consider it wise to sit on the sidelines.The issues behind Advance Auto Parts’ recent reversal of fortune (inflationary pressures, a post-pandemic cool down in demand for aftermarket auto parts) may persist longer-than-expected. If AAP’s fiscal results remain lackluster in the coming quarters, forget about a rebound. Further declines for AAP are more likely.Story continuesAlly Financial (ALLY)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonAfter falling on auto and banking-related worries earlier this year, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) shares have been trending higher lately. The market is now optimistic that the auto loan-focused bank will ride out these issues. Given its valuation of only 7.1 times trailing twelve month (or TTM) earnings, ALLY stock investors also believe that a shift in sentiment could lead to an outsized rally for this seemingly-oversold stock. Yet while going contrarian may seem on the surface to be a worthwhile wager from a risk/return standpoint, in actuality that may not be the case.As seen in Ally’s most recently-released financial results, it’s clear that the deflating of the “used car bubble,” and the potential for a “auto loan crisis” are far from being in the rearview mirror. These factors could continue to weigh on results. In turn, causing ALLY to give back some of its recent gains.DISH Network (DISH)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockOn a stock screener, DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) looks like a bona fide bargain. The pay-TV service provider trades for a very low 1.9 times TTM earnings. However, there is more than meets the eye here. On a forward price-to-earnings (or P/E) basis, DISH stock trades at a much higher multiple (5.9). That still sounds super-low, but there’s a good reason why the market is assigning such a discounted valuation to DISH. As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued back in May, there is a high level of risk and uncertainty with the company.Streaming has decimated DISH’s legacy satellite TV business, and its Sling TV streaming business has floundered as well. A turnaround hinges on its pivot towards becoming primarily a provider of 5G wireless services. As there is a strong chance this fails to happen, DISH belongs in the “sell value stocks” category.Moderna (MRNA)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockLike DISH, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) looks cheap on a TTM basis, but is pricier on a forward basis. The biotech company, known for its Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, trades for just 10.8 times earnings from the preceding four quarters. However, expected earnings declines with MRNA stock are far more severe. With the mass vaccinations of the pandemic era now a distant memory, Moderna’s sales have fallen to a point where the company is expected to report negative earnings per share (or EPS) during 2023, 2024, and 2025.Yes, with nearly $9 billion in cash on hand, Moderna has the means to absorb these losses, which are related to its efforts to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines. Still, given that not even management seems confident in a “second act,” it’s better to consider Moderna one of the overvalued stocks to sell, rather than one of the undervalued stocks to buy.Nutrien (NTR)earningsSource: ShutterstockEarly last year, the trend was your friend with Nutrien (NYSE:NTR). Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the post-invasion economic sanctions against Russia, exacerbated an already-tight fertilizer market, causing a big jump in prices. This in turn led to a big run-up in price for NTR stock, as investors bought in on the prospect of record earnings from this fertilizer products producer. Flash forward to now, though, and trends are clearly no longer strongly on Nutrien’s side. Fertilizer prices have tumbled, and the company’s earnings in 2023 and 2024 are set to fall, after a banner year in 2022.These earnings declines may seem more than priced-in NTR, given its forward valuation of just 8.9 times earnings. Yet with sell-side analysts like Berenberg Bank’s Aron Ceccarelli downgrading the stock due to the expectation of further fertilizer price declines, this is another candidate for your “sell value stocks” pile.Signet Jewelers (SIG)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockSignet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) isn’t a household name, but I’m sure you are familiar with the jewelry retailer’s numerous customer-facing brands, which include Blue Nile, Kay, Jared, and Zales. Trading for only 6.4 times earnings, SIG stock may seem like a high-grade gem on the surface. Yet if you look at it through a loupe, it’s debatable whether this low-priced jewelry stock is really a diamond in the rough. Earlier this month, Signet released its latest quarterly results and updates to guidance. While last quarter’s numbers came in ahead of estimates, Signet’s guidance update fell far short of expectations.Persistent economic challenges may mean further disappointment in the quarters ahead with the company’s operating results. If economic conditions worsen, causing a further slackening of demand for consumer discretionary products like jewelry, management and analysts may have to walk back forecasts again. This could lead to more declines for SIG.AT&amp;T (T)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockWhen critics of the value investing philosophy tell you to sell value stocks, they are really talking about selling value stocks like AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). However, “Ma Bell” doesn’t represent all value stocks.Rather, T stock is a prime example of one of the key value investing pitfalls: mistaking a low valuation and a high dividend yield as signs of deep value. As a mature, capital-intensive telecom company, it makes sense for AT&amp;T to trade at a low 6.6 times forward earnings. This holds especially true, when you consider that AT&amp;T’s high debt, not to mention the wireless industry slowdown, limits the potential for earnings growth. As for the stock’s high dividend yield? Buying T for its nearly 7% dividend may at first seem like a profitable move. However, if it’s outweighed by years and years of steady declines, this high yield is clearly not worthwhile.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023The $1 Investment You MUST Take Advantage of Right NowIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

This is a shame, because there are many lesser-known stocks that have racked up huge gains in both the short and long-terms, and beaten the broader market by a wide margin.Typically, these are stocks of specialty companies that operate in a narrow segment of the economy. Many exceptionally well-run companies target a niche market and perform under the radar as small and medium-sized enterprise. Their executives don’t appear on CNBC and their ticker symbols aren’t splashed across the frontpage of The Wall Street Journal. But these stocks are like the little engine that could, quietly chugging their way to big gains for stockholders.Here are three lesser-known stocks that could make you rich.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCROXCrocs$111.06MNSTMonster Beverage$58.81DECKDeckers Outdoor$513.29Crocs (CROX)The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.Source: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.comBig gains can often be found in the stocks of unique, niche companies. Such is the case with Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX), the footwear company that specializes in making foam clogs. What started out as a novelty item sold largely seen along beach boardwalks has grown into a major corporation that today has more than 6,500 employees and annual sales in excess of $2 billion. Indeed, CROX stock has also been a powerhouse, gaining 117% over the last 12 months and increasing 508% over the past five years.CROX stock has outperformed the shares of both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) since 2018. Foam clogs have literally bested the iPhone in terms of stock performance. Who knew?Key to Crocs’ success is the company’s endlessly inventive marketing campaigns, which emphasize fun and comfort to its consumers. The company most recently announced a partnership with Taco Bell that will see Crocs release a limited edition shoe with the restaurant’s branding. That kind of creativity has taken CROX stock far over the years, and should continue to do so.Story continuesMonster Beverage (MNST)Source: ShutterstockMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is likely familiar to many investors as the company that sells energy drinks with muscular names such as “Monster Energy,” “Relentless,” and “Burn.” However, MNST stock doesn’t get as much attention as it should, given its impressive track record of outperformance.The company’s share price is up 15% this year, has gained 33% over the last 12 months, risen 108% over five years, and increased 525% since June 2013. Twenty years ago, the stock was trading at 4 cents a share.The stellar performance of MNST stock can be attributed to the fact that energy drinks have become an accepted part of mainstream culture and continue to rise in popularity. Despite health warnings about the excessive amounts of caffeine and sugar in energy drinks, consumers can’t get enough of them. This has propelled Monster’s earnings and stock to new heights. Notably, MNST stock has split three times since 2012, most recently a two-for-one split executed in March of this year.Monster is now getting into the alcohol business, which it sees as a future driver of growth. In 2022, the company bought craft beer maker CANArchy for $330 million. CANArchy makes flavored malt liquor with compelling names such as “The Beast Unleashed.”Deckers Outdoor (DECK)A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.Source: It for you / Shutterstock.comAnother shoe company that is not widely known, but has been kicking butt lately, is Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK). The company, which has been around since 1973, has seen its stock skyrocket. Over the last 12 months, DECK stock has increased 96%, including a 30% gain so far in 2023. Through five years, the share price has risen 325%. The success can be attributed to sales of the company’s Hoka brand of running shoes, which have become extremely popular among runners worldwide. Deckers Outdoor also makes UGG-branded footwear.Despite the huge run over the past year, analysts remain bullish on DECK stock. Raymond James (NYSE:RJF) just initiated coverage of Deckers Outdoor with an “outperform” (buy) rating and a price target that is 12% higher than where the shares currently trade. Sales at Decker continue to grow due to the popularity of Hoka runners.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the driving forces behind it, head on over to 5 Best Stocks for Long Term Growth. The last week of June doesn't appear to have glad tidings for the stock market. The first three weeks of the month saw a slew of data releases from the Labor Department, most of which indicated that the Federal Reserve will now consider taking a slower approach to its current interest rate hiking cycle. Consequently, investors had penciled in a fifty basis point increase for the remainder of this year, with this decision reflected in both foreign currency and stock markets.Yet, the market is still quite jittery from the shocks that it has been dealt with over the past year. The recent jitters felt as June's final week kicks off came after fresh remarks by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Mr. Jerome Powell to the U.S. Senate. Chair Powell, who discussed a wide ranging series of topics with senators, commented on the role of the central bank during the multiple failures earlier this year, the determinants behind the Fed's decision to raise interest rates, and whether it will increase rates later this year. While Mr. Powell's statements were in line with market expectations, when combined with the latest developments in key sectors of the U.S. economy, there are worries that more trouble might be headed our way.One such sector is the real estate industry. Real estate is highly receptive to interest rate hikes since both builders require access to capital to finance their projects and buyers need loans or mortgages to make costly purchases. Higher rates slow down the market, and since interest rates are at historic highs these days, the real estate sector is feeling the brunt. Not to mention, the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic saw workers shift to home. This trend has persisted, and a fresh report from Capital Economics believes that office buildings in America are unlikely to regain their pre pandemic values until 2040. With this dour backdrop, the worries of a potential recession and if the Fed's ten interest rate hikes since March 2022 are yet to fully make their impact is driving market downs.Story continuesThe talk of a recession in the economy has been going on for nearly a year now. And this talk seems to have returned now, with another Fed official jumping into the debate of future interest rate hikes. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank Mary Daly shared that two additional interest rate hikes are a real probability for the course of this year. Right now, investors are worried that the Fed might have tightened too fast, and Ms. Daly's comments saw them price in a potential recession down in the future into markets today. As of the early afternoon on June 22nd, the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.658%, the NASDAQ 100 had lost 0.89% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index was down 0.54%.However, talk of the Fed raising interest rates more later this year is not a surprise. Therefore, to explain recent downturns in the stock market, we'll have to look elsewhere as well. And this elsewhere is Europe's economic health. Economies of both France and Germany - two of Europe's biggest - shared disappointing data that made investors flee to the safe haven of treasuries. And those in the U.S. followed as they were already spooked by comments from the Fed officials. For U.S. markets, the risks of downfall are even higher as this year's recovery is not sector agnostic; instead, it is focused on a handful of sectors such as artificial intelligence that have provided investors an opportunity to break out from the dour sentiment of 2022.At this point, you might be wondering what were those statements by Chair Powell that once again spooked investors. Well, during his hearing at Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he shared:So you know the risk is that we, the reason we've slowed down really since last December we slowed from 75 to 50 basis points per meeting to 25 at every meeting. And now as we reach, as we get closer and closer to what we believe will be our, it's uncertain, we think our destination is, we've slowed down a little further. So we're trying to avoid the mistake of going too far. And that's all it is. It's, as you can see, overwhelmingly, people on the Committee do believe, it will be appropriate to raise hikes one or two additional times. A strong majority believes two times this year if the economy performs as expected.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great stocks for long term growth, out of which the top picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

If you want to skip our analysis of the medical industry and recent trends, head on over to 5 Best Medical  Stocks Under $10. The medical industry is one of the most capitally intensive and competitive sectors in the world. Broadly speaking, it has a variety of sub sectors such as pharmaceutical firms, healthcare plan providers, medical equipment providers, and hospital companies. Within it, it's often healthcare plan providers and pharmaceutical firms that often see the greatest consumer attention since most people are unaware of the fact that hospitals are also often part of companies that are traded on the stock market.Naturally, these subsegments of the medical industry have their own market valuations. The overall medical industry's profits, according to research from McKinsey, are slated to grow by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% between 2021 and 2026 and from an initial value of $654 billion to a final value of $790 billion. Diving deeper into the constituents of the medical industry, there is tons of research available that enable us to understand just how much the individual sectors are worth. In a fact that might surprise you, the hospital industry is one of the most valuable medical industries in the sector. It's estimated to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% between 2021 and 2028, from an initial value of $820 billion to a final value of $2 trillion. The second most valuable medical industry is pharmaceutical manufacturing. This segment was worth $358 billion in 2020 and is slated to grow to a whopping $1.2 trillion by 2030 through growing at a CAGR of 13%.Yet, the discussion so far excludes perhaps the most popular medical segment and certainly the fastest growing. A boom in computing has spurred new industries and injected fresh life into older ones, and for healthcare and medical, this applies to the biotechnology market. Estimates about its value, and not only the growth are equally likely to stun you. For instance, research from Grand View Research outlines that the biotechnology industry was worth $1.37 trillion in 2022. And despite the trillion dollar valuation, the sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.96% between 2023 and 2030 to be worth a stunning $3.88 trillion. Naturally, you might be curious about which biotechnology stocks hedge funds are investing in (this is a hedge fund tracking website after all), and some of their top biotechnology stock picks are Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).Story continuesThe outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic shook up both the world and the medical industry. At the same time, these changes also transformed the sector, and to an extent, changed the operating dynamics of medical firms. At least that's what McKinsey believes, who, in a fresh report, shares some tips for healthcare firms to be successful in the future. The research and consultancy firm believes that healthcare firms have to develop a more consumer centric approach in their business moving forward. This makes intuitive sense, particularly in America, where the high costs of healthcare and the strict bureaucratic systems within the sector often miss out on the pain that people are going through. McKinsey believes that out of the eight steps in the healthcare journey - namely getting coverage, understanding benefits, finding and receiving care, following up with a provider, managing prescriptions, managing health, and paying for care - customers are highly dissatisfied with four. If you are familiar with the American healthcare system, you'd be unsurprised to know that these four segments are getting coverage, saving for care, finding coverage, and understanding benefits.This dissatisfaction is affecting both the health of the consumers and the burden emergency rooms have to deal with. The two are inextricably related, even though the latter might sound counterintuitive at first. According to McKinsey, people who are dissatisfied with healthcare and the medical industry, often delay their care which eventually leads to more emergency visits in the future. To solve these problems, the firm suggests that solutions such as a transparent payment process will go a long way for both consumers and healthcare providers.Moving our attention back to stocks, true to form, some of the biggest healthcare and medical companies in the world are American. However, when it comes to the biggest hospital companies, the picture is more balanced, with American, European, and Chinese companies present in the list of the biggest hospital companies in the world. Some top hospital companies in terms of their total assets are HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA (NYSE:FMS), and Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC).Finally, 2023's inflationary pressures, which are finally starting to ease have also caused worries of a recession due to the methods used to bring down prices. So what's in store for the healthcare sector? Well, here's what the management of HCA Healthcare had to say during its first quarter of 2023 earnings call:With respect to our people agenda, we saw continued improvements across virtually all metrics.The improvement in turnover rates accelerated from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter close to pre-pandemic levels. Registered nurse hiring also improved in the quarter. Hiring increased almost 19%, compared to the previous four quarter average. These positive results helped reduce contract labor cost 21%, compared to last year. We continue to invest in our people through compensation programs, increased training and innovative care models. We believe these programs advanced our capabilities to provide high quality care to our patients. Once again, our colleagues demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and deliver value across all stakeholder groups.I want to thank them for their dedication, their hard work, and their overall effectiveness.During the quarter, we continued to experience periodic capacity constraints that prevented us from fully operating our capacity. As compared to the fourth quarter, instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined 25% and represented 1.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which was down from 2% in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with this improved trend it still remains above pre-pandemic levels.Close with this, we remain encouraged by the backdrop of strong demand that we saw in our markets.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great medical stocks under $10, out of which some top picks are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest packaging companies in the world.With hundreds and thousands of products popping up in the market every year, the need for good packaging has also become a priority in most of the manufacturers' minds. The packaging industry is growing extremely fast, with competitors showing up left, right and center. With sustainability becoming a core part of the developing world, along with taking care of the environmental issues, the packaging industry is also consistently evolving to meet the demands. Companies that are catering to these needs are working on innovating to replace plastic packaging and bringing in biodegradable products that will help protect our planet. This is happening because people are now aware of the impact non biodegradable waste like plastic and metal are having on our environment. The global packaging market is divided into North America, Europe, APAC, South America, the Middle East and Africa.Top 15 Packaging Companies in the worldIt is also important to note that the package of any product is the first interaction that brand is having with their customers. This can either be turned into something completely in the brand's favor, or leave a negative impact on the client. By giving them a packaging experience they will remember, the brand's identity can be strengthened. This generation is one that puts everything on social media, and one favorable experience can turn into a large number of sales for a brand. Now brands are focusing equally on the product, and the way they package their products, knowing that their customers are equally excited by both. Especially since COVID-19 hit the world, and in person shopping became extremely limited, it was online shopping that brought these brands back. All online shopping was shipped to customers in some sort of packaging to maintain the quality of the product inside. Meanwhile, home deliveries became more popular, especially in the food sector, since restaurants and big offices were closed. When people were working from home, they wanted to get their food delivered to them. because of which the demand for packaged containers and cartons increased massively. Online grocery shopping also became a huge part of daily lives globally. When the pandemic hit, consumer behaviors were intensely affected and so was the packaging industry. It was one of the industries that wasn't shut down during the lockdown situation globally.Story continuesWhen companies decided to turn eco-friendly, some big brands also decided that it was time. Coca Cola (NYSE: KO) wanted to shift to a more sustainable lifestyle and thus decided to test paper bottles from an extra-strong paper shell consisting of a thin plastic liner. They experimented with approximately 2000 bottles to see if their theory worked, in February 2021. Other examples include Nestlé,  who aim to turn all their packaging into such that is either paper based or recyclable/reusable by the year 2025. ""The global packaging market value is approximately $1,015 billion, calculated on the value of finished products. ""The estimated annual growth rate during 2021-2026 is on average +4%."", as reported by Metsa.According to Technavio, the global packaging market may increase by around $223.96 billion between 2022 to 2027 at a CAGR of 3.92%. Further data suggests that there will be global expansion in the packaging market, and developing markets like Asia will see more packaged consumer goods due to an increase in real income. Based on this report, Asia is the largest market for packaged goods followed by North America. The packaging trends for the future include majority companies switching from the biggest packaging material used, plastic, to more biodegradable products such as plant-based packaging, made from hemp, coconut and even sugarcane. This is why many of the biggest packaging companies in the world make sure that the focus is one their sustainable packaging efforts, as demonstrated by Amcor (NYSE: AMCR), whose CEO mentioned in the company's Q4 2022 earnings call ""And finally, sustainability is fundamental to everything we do from an innovation perspective and remains at the forefront of discussions with global brand owners. As the sustainability leader in the packaging industry, we continue to be the supplier of choice to help our customers achieve their goals in a meaningful way and at scale.""Apart from being environmentally friendly, sustainable packaging practices are also considered to be an affordable option for companies. Another trend that already exists is customized packaging. As mentioned above, brands are making a lot of efforts to make sure their potential customers are aware of the brand, and also remember them. So making sure that the packaging is attractive and provides a good user experience is very important for them now. With the need for packaging growing globally, the packaging industry is slowly becoming one of the biggest industries in the world and is fundamentally important to many other industries.MethodologyTo find out the 15 biggest packaging companies in the world, we have used the official statistics published by Yahoo! Finance, considering their market cap and TTM revenue. We then ranked them according to both these criteria, and used those numbers to calculate the average ranking.

Interestingly, he will still produce the follow-up seasons of both ""Monster"" and ""The Watcher"" — similar to how he continued to produce FX's ""American Horror Story"" while still at Netflix.Netflix and Disney have not yet commented on the rumored departure.The famed producer joined Netflix in 2018 with a high-profile $300 million contract. Shonda Rhimes also signed with the platform around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal as the streaming giant leaned into a growth-at-all-costs spending strategy and set off an accelerated arms race for content.Flash forward to today, and it's a drastically different environment.Writer/director Ryan Murphy is widely expected to leave Netflix at the end of his current contract. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)A focus on profitabilityRevenue initiatives like ad-supported tiers and password sharing crackdowns have become the industry norm. Virtually every major media company has undergone layoffs and restructured its business in a bid to improve streaming profitability and lessen losses. Price increases have also been implemented (or at the very least teased) in order to improve average revenue per user, or ARPU.Content spending growth has shrunk amid those efforts: ""As we now painfully know, money is no longer cheap,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a note earlier this year.Story continuesFishman predicted a ""flattening in 2023"" when it comes to content spending, which previously enjoyed two strong years of double-digit growth: ""As more companies shift their focus away from solely subscriber growth, we would expect industry content spending to be relatively flat or even decline in the out-years.""Netflix has said its content spend will be flat year-over-year at $17 billion. It will cut costs in other areas with plans to slash its overall spending by about $300 million this year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Netflix declined to comment at the time of that report.""For the longest time, the running industry joke was Netflix would pay for everything and throw as much as they could at the wall and see what sticks,"" Lumley said. ""Content is king. It's still very much prevalent. ...But now with the change in priorities, the idea is that they need to be a bit more strategic.""As Netflix adopts a more strategic approach to driving its content engagement, Wall Street analysts have called out two big drivers of future growth: international content and live sports.Netflix's global pushEarlier this week, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated his $2.5 billion commitment to fund original Korean content over the next four years, adding the company has plans to further expand its original programming to include Korean unscripted series and movies.""I think what’s brilliant is to see film, unscripted and series all grow according to the interests of our Korean audience,"" Sarandos said during an event at Seoul’s Four Seasons Hotel on Wednesday. ""You’ll see the investment in the ecosystem, in front and behind the camera, including training, to grow the industry.""Sarandos' comments come as the company transitions from a Korean content licensor to full-fledged producer, with recent original series like ""The Glory"" and ""All of Us Are Dead"" taking off on the platform.According to Sarandos, about three-fifths of Netflix’s users have watched a Korean show.Netflix's first original Korean title debuted in 2018, illustrating its steady push into local-language films and series over the years. Currently, about two-thirds of Netflix subscribers stem from outside the US.Netflix is entering its next phase of content growth as the company looks to trim costs and boost engagement in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""In general, shows produced outside of the US can be cheaper while still maintaining a high level of quality, which is definitely advantageous for Netflix,"" Lumley said. ""There's the proven demand of international content, and increased acceptability within US audiences.""Lumley called out the record-breaking performances of international series like ""Squid Game"" and ""Money Heist,"" explaining audiences have become more accustomed to dubbed content, or content that's not in viewers' native language.CFRA analyst Ken Leon added that international content is ""by far"" Netflix's biggest edge over its rivals, telling Yahoo Finance: ""[Netflix's] competitive advantage is their global reach and their ability to move content around the world to specific countries.""Live sports 'will fit well' into Netflix's content strategy

    Live sports content has quickly emerged as another untapped area for Netflix, even as tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL) have snatched up pricey professional sports contracts over the past year.But Netflix has taken its own unique approach by producing docuseries and sports-adjacent content like ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" ""Full Swing,"" and ""Break Point"" instead of committing to big-ticket deals.""I'd say in sports, our position has been the same — we're not anti-sports, we're pro profits,"" Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call in January. ""We've not been able to figure out how to deliver profits in renting big league sports in our subscription model. Not to say that won't change. We'll be open to it, but that's where it's at today.""Experts say Netflix's strategy has created a new opportunity around the untapped potential of sports within the streaming market.""You can see the power of Netflix just in terms of the documentary-style content,"" Jon Christian, EVP of digital media supply chain at media and entertainment-focused consulting company Qvest told Yahoo Finance. ""I think Netflix is solely responsible for F1 being [as popular as it is] in the United States right now.""Christian said Netflix's documentary-style approach helps audiences connect to players, adding, ""This is the way that you could franchise around sports.""Mercedes driver George Russell of Britain drives down pit lane during the first practice session for the Formula One Miami Grand Prix auto race, Friday, May 5, 2023, at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Fla.

At the time, Netflix blamed the failure on a technical error but emphasized the platform has the fundamental infrastructure in place to successfully pull off a live event.Overall, Christian said Netflix may have to eventually pay up for a professional sports contract as ""sports is the last frontier of the cord cutters.""Morgan Stanley analysts agree, writing in a new report published on Wednesday, ""Eventually we expect Netflix to move into live sports, particularly as it scales in [free cash flow] generation and has the ability to invest in major sports rights around the world. In addition, as its advertising capabilities scale, we think live sports will fit well into its content offering.""""Netflix has consistently expanded its product offering, from licensed to originals, from scripted to unscripted, from TV to film, from US to global, and even into games. It is only logical in our view that eventually it will move into live sports — and likely in a big way,"" the analysts added.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

If you want to skip our analysis of the precious metals industry and how gold is particularly relevant to the economy today, head on over to 5 Best Precious Metals Stocks to Buy. All that glitters is not gold. But, despite today's day and age where cryptocurrencies reign supreme, gold is still one of the more popular commodities for investors, as a reserve for central banks, and as a material for people who like items of adornment such as jewelry.Consequently, the precious metals market is one of the more lucrative industries in the world. And the industry itself is coming off of the high that it experienced last year. Global gold demand jumped to 4,741 tonnes last year, marking a stunning 18% annual gain in a tough macroeconomic environment that was dominated by the strong U.S. dollar due to the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes. The strong dollar and high interest rates led to turmoil in the treasury market since older securities were issued with lower rates. As central banks realized the peril of relying too much on government securities for their reserves, they chose to turn to gold as an alternative. During the same time period, as the demand for gold peaked, so did its price, which touched $1,800 per ounce on average in 2022.Then, in 2023, gold prices started to soar even higher as inflationary pressures started to reduce in America. It jumped to $1,836 by later March as investors became wary of a weakening dollar due to the Federal Reserve taking its foot off of the interest rate pedal. By April, the price seemed to have no end in sight, soaring further to $1,980 per ounce and bringing back the shine to the metal. This wasn't the highest level that it would touch during the month, with a peak price of $2,055 per ounce as the second week of April ended.But how is gold doing these days? After all, June has been a month of significant softening in the U.S. labor market and a tilt towards dovishness from the Federal Reserve - both factors that we would wager would be bullish for gold prices. Well currently, gold is trading at roughly $1,914 per ounce - maintaining a bullish trend that started in October 2022. However, from the start of this month, the price has been dropping. Gold was trading at roughly $1,980 per ounce at the start of June, so it appears that the market has other things on its mind apart from the Fed and the American economy.Story continuesThe recent dip in gold might be due to the Bank of England, which finally (and reluctantly) opened the flood gates of hawkishness in June as it hiked interest rates by fifty basis points. Analysts believe that this might have caused bullion to drop, while others believe that the root of the turmoil is still the Fed as Chair Powell reiterated to the U.S. Senate that his bank will further increase interest rates later this year. (On a side note, if you're interested in understanding the mechanics of gold price, checking out Gold’s Price Decline Below $2,000 and its Implications might be worth your while). Some companies that have their fortunes tied to gold are Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), and Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC).However, gold is not the only precious metal in the world. One metal that sees its price closely followed by analysts along with gold is silver. Some top silver mining companies in the world are Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL). And alongside gold, silver is booming as well. Data from The Silver Institute shows that global silver demand posted a record high in 2022 when it peaked at a whopping 1.24 billion ounces. This growth, surprisingly, was fueled primarily by silverware, whose demand jumped by a surprising 80% to sit at 73.5 Moz. In second place for growth, demand for silver jewelry jumped by 29% to sit at 234 million ounces. However, the biggest user of silver was the industrial segment of the global silver market. Demand from this segment grew by 18% to sit at 556 million ounces, with the requirements of photovoltaic and 5G applications among others sitting at the heart of the growth.With the first half of 2023 nearly coming to an end, let's take a look at what's happening in the precious metals industry right now. On this front, here's what the management of Kinross Gold was experiencing during the first quarter of 2023:We saw a strong performance from our operations in Q1 with all of our mines achieving planned production. Approximately one-third of our production came from the U.S., whereas anticipated costs were elevated. The mines are achieving their targets and we expect cost to come down in the next couple of years as temperature decrease and grades improve. In addition, we are successfully executing on projects at Fort Knox and Round Mountain, which we expect to provide higher grade higher margin production in the future, helping drive down the costs in the U.S. Our assets outside the U.S. accounted for approximately two-thirds of production and delivered strong cash flow for the company with an average cost and $800 an ounce.At Tasiast, we had a strong quarter, continue to account the planned downtime for the reason times with production of 131,000 ounces, and cash costs of $688 an ounce. Tasiast continue to successfully ramp up with both January and March achieving record monthly production of around 55,000 ounces. Our major plant shutdown in February to install a new vibrating screen as part of the 24K project was completed successfully. In addition, we use the shutdown as an opportunity to make other improvements to sustain higher recoveries with increased grades and throughput. The project remains on schedule to reach throughput of 24,000 tons a day by mid-year, followed by a ramp up to sustain the throughput by the end of the year. We will remain on track to meet our 2023 Production guidance of 610,000 ounces.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best precious metal stocks that are finding favor with hedge funds.

Triple digits have been reached across the state, hitting 125F in Corpus Christi and 118F in Rio Grande, as recorded by the heat index – which provides a combination of temperature and humidity.Meanwhile, the need for air conditioning has seen demand for power spike – and so has the price. Electricity prices doubled, and earlier this week got as high as $5,000 per megawatt-hour. Making matters worse, especially near the Gulf Coast, is unusually high humidity. Forecasters predict the temperatures are set to rise higher and last into the week of 4 July, meaning there is no prospect of early relief.But dangerous situations, which this heat wave certainly is, can also bring opportunities – and investors can capitalize on the Texas crisis. The high utility prices are one obvious boon, as power companies on the Texas grid will likely see a cash windfall in the aftermath, but renewable energy companies also stand to gain long-term, as the State of Texas faces the need to expand its power generation capacity.So, let’s take a look at some power companies that can post gains on their Texas business. Here are the details, drawn from the TipRanks data files, along with comments from the Street’s analysts.Vistra Energy (VST)We’ll start with Vistra Energy, a utility company based in Irving, Texas, and one of the largest utility-scale power generation companies in the US. Vistra employs more than 5,000 people and boasts over 37,000 megawatts of total generation capacity – and approximately 3,400 megawatts of that total come from zero-carbon renewable sources. In addition, Vistra owns an energy storage system in Moss Landing, California that is rated at 750-MW/3,000MWhbattery, making it the world’s largest such facility.Vistra’s demonstrated generation capacity allows it to market electricity in 20 states plus DC. The company serves more than 4.3 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Vistra’s generation portfolio includes a mix of natural gas, nuclear, and solar production, and it is also a major purchaser of wind power.Story continuesWhile Vistra operates across the US, its Texas operations make up the single largest component of its adjusted EBITDA, at $383 million out of $541 million consolidated in 1Q23, although the figure fell short of the Street’s $575 million target for the quarter. On the other hand, the company had total revenues of $4.43 billion, up 41.5% year-over-year and beating the forecast by some $2.5 billion.Vistra also pays a dividend and declared the latest payment of $0.204 per common share for 2Q23. This represents a 3.3% increase from the prior payout and provides a yield of ~3.20%.While the adjusted EBITDA result fell short of expectations, BMO analyst James Thalacker’s believes this stock is attractively priced and he sees the company as a competitive player In the industry. Thalacker writes, “We view Vistra’s 1Q23 positively and we continue to be buyers of the name at a sub 5x EV/EBITDA multiple and 30%+ FCFY. While 1Q23 results were light of consensus, management had a positive forward outlook pointing to upside in the company’s stand-alone 2024/2025 Ongoing Operations Adjusted EBITDA opportunities midpoint range of $3,500-3,700mm. The upside is due to opportunistic hedging since May 2022 and continued robust forward power curves which are allowing EBITDA to track closer to ~$3,700-3,800mm range.”The analyst goes on to give these shares an Outperform (Buy) rating, and his $36 price target indicates his confidence in a one-year upside potential of 43%. (To watch Thalacker’s track record, click here.)While Vistra only has 4 recent analyst reviews, they are all positive – giving the stock its unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $25.1o and have an average one-year price target of $33.75, implying a gain of 34% in the next 12 months. (See Vistra’s stock forecast)NextEra Energy (NEE)The second stock on our list is NextEra Energy, a major player in the US market for clean and renewable power generation. NextEra is based in Florida, and its main subsidiary is Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL), through which it has more than 5.8 million active customers. Overall, the company provides power to more than 12 million people in its home state.NextEra is also active in Texas, where it maintains a substantial network of wind, solar, and natural gas power generation facilities, as well as a power transmission line and substations in the center of the state, connecting several of the windfarms to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The company is also expanding its presence in Texas; last year, it contracted with a division of the UK-based petrochemical firm Ineos to build a 310 MW solar power facility in the state. The new facility, planned to start operations in 2025, will dedicate its full power output to Ineos O&amp;P USA manufacturing, fractionation, and storage operations.Zooming out for a wider look at the company, we find that NextEra showed $6.72 billion in revenue in 1Q23, $1.42 billion above the estimates. The company’s non-GAAP earnings, at 84 cents per share, came in 8 cents better than expected.This success in the green economy underlies HSBC analyst Meike Becker’s review of NextEra shares. She writes, “We believe NextEra is an excellent capital allocator in the fast growing, low-risk, high-margin US network and renewables market. On our estimates, Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) – a fully regulated utility – will deliver 7-12% EPS CAGR in 2025-2030e, with investments in renewables and electricity networks and excellent returns for a great service at low cost. We forecast NextEra Energy Resources to reach EPS CAGR of 4-10% for 2025-30e as the leading renewables developer in the highly attractive US market. The inflation reduction act has improved the outlook further.”Looking ahead, Becker gives NEE a Buy rating, and her target price of $90 implies a gain of 21% out to the one-year time horizon. (To watch Becker’s track record, click here.)There are 11 recent analyst reviews on file for NextEra and these include 8 to Buy and 3 to Hold, to give the stock its consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The shares, which are trading for $74.17, have an average price target of $89.50, suggesting a 12-month gain of 21%.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”26. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight. On May 25, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported an FQ3 non-GAAP EPS of $3.43, beating market consensus by $0.12.

Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23.

AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc.

The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 220Index Weight: 1.7168%With an index weight of 1.71%, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 8th on the S&amp;P 500.

(NASDAQ:META), compared to 194 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 8 million shares worth $1.70 billion. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Index Weight: 1.727553%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with an index weight of 1.72%, ranks 7th on the S&amp;P 500 list. These are class C shares, and shareholders have no voting rights. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $1.17 and a revenue of $69.79 billion, topping Wall Street consensus by $0.10 and $950 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 155 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 152 funds in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 204Index Weight: 1.996184%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 6th on the S&amp;P 500 index, with an index weight of nearly 2%.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

It’s not sellers, many of whom are not even in the game. Those who are aren’t ahead, either, because they'll eventually become buyers.The winner — or winners? The homebuilders.An imbalance in supply and demand — brought on by the down-then-up path mortgage rates took since the start of the pandemic — has been a boon to builders.And they know it, too.Confidence among builders finally pushed into positive territory this month, the first time in 11 months, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Expectations for current sales, and sales six months down the line, were also cheery.“There is so little inventory available on the resale side that it's pushing buyers to pay the premium for new as compared to resell because there just isn't a lot out there that's desirable for them,"" KB Home Chairman, President, and CEO Jeffrey Mezger said this week on the builder’s investor call. ""So we're pretty pleased.""KB Home (KBH) was the latest builder to turn in better-than-expected quarterly earnings and rosier guidance, following the same path as D.R. Horton (DHI), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Brothers (TOL) and Lennar Corp. (LEN)That enthusiasm has translated into more shovels in the ground.Single-family housing starts in May jumped 18.5% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 997,000, according to government data released this week. Building permits for single-home construction rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 897,000 units, up 4.8% from April.""We have not seen that level in the 10 years prior to the pandemic,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above.) ""So builders are ramping up. Their profits are turning in. And there's a financial incentive to produce more.""Story continuesHappy days: A Toll Brothers housing development Carlsbad, California. (REUTERS/Mike Blake) (Mike Blake / reuters)Those homes are sorely needed, largely because current owners hold favorable mortgages. Why would you want to sell only to turn around and buy another, more expensive home, with a mortgage rate that’s twice as high?You wouldn't.The numbers tell the story: Practically all homeowners with a mortgage have a current mortgage rate below 6%, Redfin reported last week. About 4 in 5 homeowners with mortgages have an interest rate below 5%, and nearly a quarter have a rate below 3%, likely when they refinanced during the pandemic when rates hit all-time lows.So while the number of previously owned homes on the market did increase in May to 1.08 million units, that's still below the pre-pandemic norm of 1.9 million homes, according to the NAR's release on existing home sales. The total was the lowest count on record for the month of May.Redfin, per new data, also found that the number of houses for sale in the US hit a new low in May.""The tight existing inventory environment has been a tailwind for new home sales,” James Egan, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""In fact, new home sales made up the largest share of total transactions in the first quarter of the year since 2006.""More good news for homebuilders: Egan revised his forecast for home prices, expecting no growth for the year versus his prior expectation of a 4% decline.But there's hope for potential buyers of existing homes: mortgage rates show signs of retreat.Freddie Mac (FHL.SG) said rates have softened in the last three weeks — down to 6.67%. And this week Realtor.com revised its forecast for mortgage rates, predicting the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage will average 6.4% throughout the year, and hit 6.1% by end of year. That’s lower than its previous estimate of 7.4% throughout the year and 7.1% by year-end.So would 6% be enough to revive the resale market?""There’s no magic number because it’s probably different for every homeowner,"" First American Financial Corp. Chief Economist Mark Fleming told Yahoo Finance.

35,7e45e510-86c1-35e5-a0d4-54960ee2ad4b,JNJ,2023-06-25,11 Best Medical  Stocks Under $10,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-medical-stocks-under-191941442.html,1687634381,STORY,"['TEVA', 'GDRX', 'ELAN', 'ADPT', 'HCA', 'IOVA', 'CBAY', 'JNJ', 'ABBV']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the eleven best medical stocks under $10. If you want to skip our analysis of the medical industry and recent trends, head on over to 5 Best Medical  Stocks Under $10. The medical industry is one of the most capitally intensive and competitive sectors in the world. Broadly speaking, it has a variety of sub sectors such as pharmaceutical firms, healthcare plan providers, medical equipment providers, and hospital companies. Within it, it's often healthcare plan providers and pharmaceutical firms that often see the greatest consumer attention since most people are unaware of the fact that hospitals are also often part of companies that are traded on the stock market.Naturally, these subsegments of the medical industry have their own market valuations. The overall medical industry's profits, according to research from McKinsey, are slated to grow by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% between 2021 and 2026 and from an initial value of $654 billion to a final value of $790 billion. Diving deeper into the constituents of the medical industry, there is tons of research available that enable us to understand just how much the individual sectors are worth. In a fact that might surprise you, the hospital industry is one of the most valuable medical industries in the sector. It's estimated to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% between 2021 and 2028, from an initial value of $820 billion to a final value of $2 trillion. The second most valuable medical industry is pharmaceutical manufacturing. This segment was worth $358 billion in 2020 and is slated to grow to a whopping $1.2 trillion by 2030 through growing at a CAGR of 13%.Yet, the discussion so far excludes perhaps the most popular medical segment and certainly the fastest growing. A boom in computing has spurred new industries and injected fresh life into older ones, and for healthcare and medical, this applies to the biotechnology market. Estimates about its value, and not only the growth are equally likely to stun you. For instance, research from Grand View Research outlines that the biotechnology industry was worth $1.37 trillion in 2022. And despite the trillion dollar valuation, the sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.96% between 2023 and 2030 to be worth a stunning $3.88 trillion. Naturally, you might be curious about which biotechnology stocks hedge funds are investing in (this is a hedge fund tracking website after all), and some of their top biotechnology stock picks are Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).Story continuesThe outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic shook up both the world and the medical industry. At the same time, these changes also transformed the sector, and to an extent, changed the operating dynamics of medical firms. At least that's what McKinsey believes, who, in a fresh report, shares some tips for healthcare firms to be successful in the future. The research and consultancy firm believes that healthcare firms have to develop a more consumer centric approach in their business moving forward. This makes intuitive sense, particularly in America, where the high costs of healthcare and the strict bureaucratic systems within the sector often miss out on the pain that people are going through. McKinsey believes that out of the eight steps in the healthcare journey - namely getting coverage, understanding benefits, finding and receiving care, following up with a provider, managing prescriptions, managing health, and paying for care - customers are highly dissatisfied with four. If you are familiar with the American healthcare system, you'd be unsurprised to know that these four segments are getting coverage, saving for care, finding coverage, and understanding benefits.This dissatisfaction is affecting both the health of the consumers and the burden emergency rooms have to deal with. The two are inextricably related, even though the latter might sound counterintuitive at first. According to McKinsey, people who are dissatisfied with healthcare and the medical industry, often delay their care which eventually leads to more emergency visits in the future. To solve these problems, the firm suggests that solutions such as a transparent payment process will go a long way for both consumers and healthcare providers.Moving our attention back to stocks, true to form, some of the biggest healthcare and medical companies in the world are American. However, when it comes to the biggest hospital companies, the picture is more balanced, with American, European, and Chinese companies present in the list of the biggest hospital companies in the world. Some top hospital companies in terms of their total assets are HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA (NYSE:FMS), and Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC).Finally, 2023's inflationary pressures, which are finally starting to ease have also caused worries of a recession due to the methods used to bring down prices. So what's in store for the healthcare sector? Well, here's what the management of HCA Healthcare had to say during its first quarter of 2023 earnings call:With respect to our people agenda, we saw continued improvements across virtually all metrics.The improvement in turnover rates accelerated from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter close to pre-pandemic levels. Registered nurse hiring also improved in the quarter. Hiring increased almost 19%, compared to the previous four quarter average. These positive results helped reduce contract labor cost 21%, compared to last year. We continue to invest in our people through compensation programs, increased training and innovative care models. We believe these programs advanced our capabilities to provide high quality care to our patients. Once again, our colleagues demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and deliver value across all stakeholder groups.I want to thank them for their dedication, their hard work, and their overall effectiveness.During the quarter, we continued to experience periodic capacity constraints that prevented us from fully operating our capacity. As compared to the fourth quarter, instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined 25% and represented 1.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which was down from 2% in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with this improved trend it still remains above pre-pandemic levels.Close with this, we remain encouraged by the backdrop of strong demand that we saw in our markets.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great medical stocks under $10, out of which some top picks are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA), and CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBAY).11 Best Medical Stocks Under $10Mila Supinskaya Glashchenko/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of medical stocks under $10, we first narrowed down the forty biggest medical companies (insurance firms are excluded) in terms of their market capitalization whose share prices were less than $10.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”26.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23.

AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc.

In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”26. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Index Weight: 0.664454%AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an American pharmaceutical company that ranks 23rd on the S&amp;P 500 index based weight.

(NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Index Weight: 0.695779%PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks, with an index weight of 0.69%. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc.

The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company. Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Lilly also has a drug in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations, and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”15.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”12. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:JPM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

UnitedHealth Group was hurt in the quarter as initial rate proposals for Medicare Advantage managed care were more negative than hoped. Fortunately, the final reimbursement rates announced after the quarter are not nearly as ominous.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

Personalized medicine, or precision medicine, takes into account the unique characteristics of every patient by focusing on their genetic and molecular makeup. By utilizing genetics, personalized medicine aims to identify and treat patients in a way that is more specific to their needs. The industry is expected to grow due to the global ageing population and an increasing number of patients worldwide with chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is among the leading causes of death globally. The disease was responsible for causing nearly one in six deaths, or around 10 million deaths, in 2020.In addition to the rising incidence of chronic diseases, advancements in technology and the utilization of genetic databases are also acting as key drivers for the personalized medicine market and the genomics market. Experts think the application of precision medicine is expanding across multiple medical specialities, such as neurology, antiviral, and pulmonary. This usage diversification, along with more economies embracing personalized medicine, is presenting new opportunities for market growth and playing in favour of the best personalized medicine stocks such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). In terms of market share, North America emerged as the leading region in the global personalized medicine industry in 2021. The region has been able to dominate the market due to a significant increase in regulatory approvals for precision medicine in the United States. Moving forward, the Middle East &amp; Africa and the Asia Pacific regions are expected to observe an increase in their market share in the next 3 years.Story continuesLeading healthcare companies like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and  Pfizer Inc.

Here’s what the firm said:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”9. Illumina, Inc.

Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”Overall, 40 hedge funds were bullish on Moderna, Inc.

While no guarantees exist for anything, those who focus on investing in biotech own a clear advantage. Almost surely, the underlying sector – which falls under the broad healthcare industry – is permanently relevant.Further, I submitted a query on ChatGPT to extract key reasons why biotech stocks for retirement make sense. Primarily, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot pointed to the potential for long-term growth. Given that the industry commands the forward capabilities of developing innovative treatments and therapies for various diseases and medical conditions, the top biotech enterprises enjoy ongoing pertinence.Second, ChatGPT identified demographic trends. Per the chatbot, “[a]s the global population continues to age, there is an increasing demand for healthcare and medical solutions. Biotech companies are at the forefront of developing novel drugs, therapies, and diagnostics to address these needs.” Because of the underlying relevance, the biotech space offers some of the most secure retirement stocks available.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmgen (AMGN)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comOne of the powerhouses among biotech stocks for retirement, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a top-level independent biotechnology firm. At the moment, the company commands a market capitalization of just over $122 billion. Since the start of this year, AMGN has been on shaky ground, losing about 13% of its equity value.Nevertheless, ChatGPT states that Amgen has a strong track record of developing innovative therapies for various diseases. It features a diversified portfolio of drugs, including treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Also, the company has a history of consistent revenue growth and has demonstrated stability in the biotech sector. Thus, it’s an appropriate idea for retirement planning stocks.Story continuesFinancially, Amgen benefits from a decent Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, indicating high operational efficiency. In addition, the company prints a trailing-year net margin of 30.23%, above 95.48% of its rivals. Finally, it presents a solid discount. Right now, the market prices AMGN at a forward multiple of 12.9. As a discount to projected earnings, Amgen ranks better than 63.85% of the competition.Gilead Sciences (GILD)Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotechSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageAnother high-level entity among retirement planning stocks in the biotech sphere, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) focuses on researching and developing antiviral drugs. During the early months of the Covid-19 crisis, Gilead’s name popped up as a possible treatment provider for the underlying disease. Currently, the company carries a market cap of almost $99 billion. Since the start of the year, GILD dipped over 7%.Despite the red ink, ChatGPT identifies Gilead as a great candidate for those investing in biotech stocks for retirement. Specifically, the company has a robust pipeline of products and a strong financial position. As well, Gilead has a history of generating significant cash flow, which can be attractive for retirement investors seeking stability and dividend potential.Speaking of which, Gilead carries a forward yield of 3.8%. This rates much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Further, the payout ratio – or the amount of earnings after tax that are paid out to shareholders – sits at a very sustainable 41.69%. Lastly, Gilead enjoys eight years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)OLK Stock.

RSLS stockSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comA high-flying example of retirement planning stocks, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the first biotechs to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry, according to its public profile. Presently, Vertex carries a market cap of just under $90 billion. Since the beginning of this year, VRTX gained over 22% of its equity value.Seemingly, VRTX continues to rise from strength to strength, gaining over 39% in the trailing one-year period. Thus, it’s an enticing candidate for high-growth biotech stocks. Per ChatGPT, the biotech has been successful in bringing innovative therapies to market that have significantly improved the lives of cystic fibrosis patients. In addition, Vertex has a dominant position in the CF market and continues to invest in research and development, making it a potential long-term growth opportunity for those investing in biotech stocks for retirement.As expected, Vertex financially benefits from strong top and bottom-line performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis hits 29.2%, above 74.54% of its peers. Its trailing-year net margin stands at an impressive 35.4%.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comAnother high-profile name among retirement planning stocks that attracted attention during the pandemic, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) originally focused on neurotrophic factors and their regenerative capabilities, giving rise to its name. Right now, Regeneron carries a market cap of just under $86 billion. Since the beginning of this year, REGN gained nearly 9% of its equity value.Per ChatGPT, Regeneron forged a reputation for discovering, developing, and commercializing medicines for serious medical conditions. It has a strong research and development pipeline with a particular emphasis on monoclonal antibodies. Regeneron also has a history of successful drug launches and partnerships, making it an attractive choice for those seeking secure retirement stocks. Onto the financials, Regeneron’s greatest strength arguably lies in its excellent profitability metrics. Both its trailing-year operating and net margins clock in above 33%, well outpacing the underlying sector average rates. Also, the market prices REGN at a forward multiple of 18.63, which is ranked favorably lower than 67.86% of its peers.Biogen (BIIB)Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA StockSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) specializes in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. At the moment, Biogen carries a market cap of just over $43 billion. Since the start of the year, BIIB gained over 9% of its market value. In the trailing 365 days, it skyrocketed almost 56%, making Biogen one of the high-growth biotech stocks.According to ChatGPT, Biogen’s main specialty focuses on the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has developed several innovative therapies for MS and other neurological disorders. Biogen has a solid financial position and a history of consistent revenue growth, which can make it suitable for those seeking secure retirement stocks.Now, the last statement about top-line growth comes with a caveat. Since the catastrophic Covid-19 disaster in 2020, revenue growth declined. Therefore, BIIB represents more of a catch-up play. However, I am inclined to believe in the recovery story, especially if we’re talking about a years-long framework. Per Gurufocus, Biogen features operational efficiency (Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9) and high fiscal stability (Altman Z-Score of 4.64). Also, it commands excellent profitability metrics.Illumina (ILMN)an image of a microscopeSource: ShutterstockBased in San Diego, California, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) develops, manufactures, and markets integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. Per its corporate profile, the company provides a line of products and services that serves the sequencing, genotyping, gene expression, and proteomics markets. Currently, the company commands a market cap of over $33 billion. Since the Jan. opener, ILMN gained almost 5%.According to ChatGPT, Illumina’s technology is widely adopted in research institutions and clinical laboratories worldwide. With the increasing importance of genomics in healthcare, Illumina may offer long-term growth potential. Therefore, ILMN enjoys significant relevancies as one of the top biotech retirement planning stocks. On the financial spectrum, Illumina benefits from key acquisitions to expand its footprint. In 2020, total revenue came out to $3.24 billion. By 2022, this tally jumped to $4.58 billion.To be fair, the company’s aggressiveness has turned off some investors, leading to ILMN trading near five-year lows. Still, this could be an enticing entry point for opportunistic investors of retirement planning stocks.Moderna (MRNA)Should You Buy BPTH Stock After 5-Fold Gain? 3 Pros, 3 Cons to ConsiderSource: ShutterstockOne of the high growth biotech stocks that stormed into the headlines during the Covid-19 crisis, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) provided a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on advanced messenger-RNA (mRNA) technologies. However, the fading of the pandemic has brought steep challenges to MRNA stock. Since the beginning of this year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Right now, the company features a market cap of nearly $50 billion.Still, ChatGPT identifies MRNA as one of the sector-related retirement planning stocks. According to the chatbot, Moderna’s success with its Covid-19 vaccine has demonstrated the potential of mRNA technology, making it an intriguing choice for retirement investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge biotech innovations. Further, the red ink doesn’t always have to imply comprehensively bad news. In part because of the fallout, Moderna appears significantly undervalued, per Gurufocus. Right now, the market prices MRNA at a trailing multiple of 11.23, ranked favorably lower than 83.27% of its peers. Also, the company features an Altman Z-Score of 8.28, indicating an extremely low risk of imminent bankruptcy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to see more of the biggest banks in the world, go directly to 5 Largest Banks in the World by Assets.Banking CrisisIt’s been a dramatic year for the banking industry following the bank run and the subsequent crash of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) earlier in March, which was followed shortly by the failure of the Signature Bank. Market panic quickly spilled over to Europe, leading to the downfall of Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS), an institution included on the list of Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), and its subsequent acquisition by UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) for three billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion). In just mere moments, Switzerland came close to facing a full-scale bank run. Several other eurozone banks, among which Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE:DB), another G-SIB, came under pressure as investors dumped their shares en masse.While the focus has been on the banking sector these past few weeks, the International Monetary Fund has come out and issued a warning regarding a potential global financial crisis emerging in the rapidly expanding alternative finance industry, commonly known as ""shadow banking."" This sector comprises various entities, including insurers, pension funds, mutual funds, and high-risk hedge funds. In such an environment, traditional banks are being increasingly bombarded by these so-called “nonbank financial institutions” alongside disruptive fintech players. Following the bank failures of a few months ago, several policymakers have been calling for even stricter regulation of traditional banks. Peaking on this issue during his 2022 shareholder report, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said:“The growing competition to banks from each other, as well as shadow banks, fintechs and large technology companies, is intense and clearly contributing to the diminishing role of banks and public companies in the United States and the global financial system. The pace of change and the size of the competition are extraordinary, and activity is accelerating. Large tech companies, already 100% digital, have hundreds of millions of customers, as well as enormous resources, in data and proprietary systems — all of which give them an extraordinary competitive advantage,”Story continuesMegabanksMegabanks, the largest financial institutions globally, are colossal enterprises with significant assets reflected on their balance sheets. These entities provide a wide array of financial services, encompassing commercial banking, corporate banking, capital markets, asset management, and beyond. The United States serves as the home for numerous megabanks primarily due to its position as the world's largest economy. As of 2021, the U.S. boasted a GDP of $23 trillion, surpassing China's $17.73 trillion in second place and Japan's $4.94 trillion in third place.For decades, banks have been merging, partnering, and expanding—so much so that the four largest banks in the United States accounted for 50% of all US banking assets last year. In an effort to cater to the rising demand for streamlined mobile banking applications and to stay competitive against neobanks and other fintech companies, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while having more than a trillion dollars in consolidated domestic assets, increased their tech spending. Thus, proving that digital payments options in the age of modern banking are nothing less than crucial.On the other side of the world, Japan's GDP grew at an annualized 2.7% in the January-March quarter from the previous three months, beating the of 1.6% and the 1.9% expansion forecast by economists. According to Bloomberg, the three largest banks in Japan, Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MFG), Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Grp, Inc. (NYSE:SMFG), and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG), are expected to forecast their highest profits in years, fueled by an upswing in client engagements and controlled expenses related to bad loans. The banks are projected to experience profit growth despite not relying on any potential changes from the central Bank of Japan. While the immediate termination of the central bank's negative interest rate policy is not widely expected, the domestic lending sector is expected to maintain a lackluster performance, hence exerting pressure on the banks to expand their international operations.25 Largest Banks in the World by AssetsCopyright: agcreativelab / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 largest banks in the world by assets, we scoured through information regarding the banking industry and came up with a list of banks who are global leaders simply based on their total assets.

Personalized medicine, or precision medicine, takes into account the unique characteristics of every patient by focusing on their genetic and molecular makeup. By utilizing genetics, personalized medicine aims to identify and treat patients in a way that is more specific to their needs. The industry is expected to grow due to the global ageing population and an increasing number of patients worldwide with chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is among the leading causes of death globally. The disease was responsible for causing nearly one in six deaths, or around 10 million deaths, in 2020.In addition to the rising incidence of chronic diseases, advancements in technology and the utilization of genetic databases are also acting as key drivers for the personalized medicine market and the genomics market. Experts think the application of precision medicine is expanding across multiple medical specialities, such as neurology, antiviral, and pulmonary. This usage diversification, along with more economies embracing personalized medicine, is presenting new opportunities for market growth and playing in favour of the best personalized medicine stocks such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). In terms of market share, North America emerged as the leading region in the global personalized medicine industry in 2021. The region has been able to dominate the market due to a significant increase in regulatory approvals for precision medicine in the United States. Moving forward, the Middle East &amp; Africa and the Asia Pacific regions are expected to observe an increase in their market share in the next 3 years.Story continuesLeading healthcare companies like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and  Pfizer Inc.

Here’s what the firm said:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”9. Illumina, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Investors can also check out 10 Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Buying and S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats List: Sorted By Hedge Fund Popularity. Our Methodology For this list, we chose the top 30 S&amp;P 500 constituents in terms of index weight. The list is ranked in ascending order of the index weight.

(NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”26. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), an American multinational computer software firm, announced its Q2 2023 financial results on June 15.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 861,306 shares worth about $428 million. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23.

The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%).

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

(NYSE:JPM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8.

Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Inverse Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.""It's Like They Don't Care About The Debt Ceiling Negotiations At All""In a recent episode of Mad Money, aired on May 23, Jim Cramer discussed the surprising market reaction to the ongoing debt ceiling talks and provided insights into the sectors that may be impacted if the government defaults on its debt. According to Cramer, despite the potential risks, the market showed resilience as investors focused on growth stocks and seemingly brushed off the concerns surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations.Cramer highlighted the noteworthy performance of companies that reported poor earnings but showed strong potential for future growth. Tech stocks, particularly cybersecurity stocks, remained in demand despite debt ceiling concerns. The market's response indicates that investors believe these companies will continue to thrive, even in the face of a potential crisis.On the other hand, consumer packaged goods companies that have historically rallied during periods of economic uncertainty, experienced a downturn. This divergence in performance suggests that the market is not heavily influenced by concerns about a debt ceiling impasse and remains optimistic about the overall economy. Though the market is not optimistic about these stocks, Cramer thinks these stocks ""are in the sweet spot, even if we crash through the debt ceiling deadline"".Cramer also discussed industries that would likely be impacted if the government were to default on its debt obligations. First, he highlighted that the real estate sector could suffer due to the anticipated rise in long-term interest rates, potentially making mortgages unaffordable. Additionally, banks would face uncertainty and may struggle as well. Utilities and companies heavily reliant on credit, such as those in the heavy machinery, aircraft parts, and auto sectors, could also experience temporary setbacks.Story continuesCramer is known for his outspoken opinions on stocks, and he often makes bold predictions about the market. However, not everyone agrees with Cramer's picks. In fact, some investors believe that the best way to make money in the stock market is to do the opposite of what Cramer says. That's where the Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) comes in.The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) is an actively managed exchange-traded fund designed to generate returns that are opposite to the investment outcomes of Jim Cramer's recommended investments, prior to accounting for fees and expenses.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Inverse Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.""It's Like They Don't Care About The Debt Ceiling Negotiations At All""In a recent episode of Mad Money, aired on May 23, Jim Cramer discussed the surprising market reaction to the ongoing debt ceiling talks and provided insights into the sectors that may be impacted if the government defaults on its debt. According to Cramer, despite the potential risks, the market showed resilience as investors focused on growth stocks and seemingly brushed off the concerns surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations.Cramer highlighted the noteworthy performance of companies that reported poor earnings but showed strong potential for future growth. Tech stocks, particularly cybersecurity stocks, remained in demand despite debt ceiling concerns. The market's response indicates that investors believe these companies will continue to thrive, even in the face of a potential crisis.On the other hand, consumer packaged goods companies that have historically rallied during periods of economic uncertainty, experienced a downturn. This divergence in performance suggests that the market is not heavily influenced by concerns about a debt ceiling impasse and remains optimistic about the overall economy. Though the market is not optimistic about these stocks, Cramer thinks these stocks ""are in the sweet spot, even if we crash through the debt ceiling deadline"".Cramer also discussed industries that would likely be impacted if the government were to default on its debt obligations. First, he highlighted that the real estate sector could suffer due to the anticipated rise in long-term interest rates, potentially making mortgages unaffordable. Additionally, banks would face uncertainty and may struggle as well. Utilities and companies heavily reliant on credit, such as those in the heavy machinery, aircraft parts, and auto sectors, could also experience temporary setbacks.Story continuesCramer is known for his outspoken opinions on stocks, and he often makes bold predictions about the market. However, not everyone agrees with Cramer's picks. In fact, some investors believe that the best way to make money in the stock market is to do the opposite of what Cramer says. That's where the Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) comes in.The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) is an actively managed exchange-traded fund designed to generate returns that are opposite to the investment outcomes of Jim Cramer's recommended investments, prior to accounting for fees and expenses. In other words, if Cramer recommends a stock, SJIM will short that stock. If Cramer recommends selling a stock, SJIM will buy that stock. Some of the most notable inverse Cramer stocks that Wall Street analysts see material upside to include Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN), and PayPal Holdings, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23.

AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc.

The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Index Weight: 1.727553%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with an index weight of 1.72%, ranks 7th on the S&amp;P 500 list. These are class C shares, and shareholders have no voting rights. On April 25, Alphabet Inc.

Harris Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the driving forces behind it, head on over to 5 Best Stocks for Long Term Growth. The last week of June doesn't appear to have glad tidings for the stock market. The first three weeks of the month saw a slew of data releases from the Labor Department, most of which indicated that the Federal Reserve will now consider taking a slower approach to its current interest rate hiking cycle. Consequently, investors had penciled in a fifty basis point increase for the remainder of this year, with this decision reflected in both foreign currency and stock markets.Yet, the market is still quite jittery from the shocks that it has been dealt with over the past year. The recent jitters felt as June's final week kicks off came after fresh remarks by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Mr. Jerome Powell to the U.S. Senate. Chair Powell, who discussed a wide ranging series of topics with senators, commented on the role of the central bank during the multiple failures earlier this year, the determinants behind the Fed's decision to raise interest rates, and whether it will increase rates later this year. While Mr. Powell's statements were in line with market expectations, when combined with the latest developments in key sectors of the U.S. economy, there are worries that more trouble might be headed our way.One such sector is the real estate industry. Real estate is highly receptive to interest rate hikes since both builders require access to capital to finance their projects and buyers need loans or mortgages to make costly purchases. Higher rates slow down the market, and since interest rates are at historic highs these days, the real estate sector is feeling the brunt. Not to mention, the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic saw workers shift to home. This trend has persisted, and a fresh report from Capital Economics believes that office buildings in America are unlikely to regain their pre pandemic values until 2040. With this dour backdrop, the worries of a potential recession and if the Fed's ten interest rate hikes since March 2022 are yet to fully make their impact is driving market downs.Story continuesThe talk of a recession in the economy has been going on for nearly a year now. And this talk seems to have returned now, with another Fed official jumping into the debate of future interest rate hikes. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank Mary Daly shared that two additional interest rate hikes are a real probability for the course of this year. Right now, investors are worried that the Fed might have tightened too fast, and Ms. Daly's comments saw them price in a potential recession down in the future into markets today. As of the early afternoon on June 22nd, the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.658%, the NASDAQ 100 had lost 0.89% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index was down 0.54%.However, talk of the Fed raising interest rates more later this year is not a surprise. Therefore, to explain recent downturns in the stock market, we'll have to look elsewhere as well. And this elsewhere is Europe's economic health. Economies of both France and Germany - two of Europe's biggest - shared disappointing data that made investors flee to the safe haven of treasuries. And those in the U.S. followed as they were already spooked by comments from the Fed officials. For U.S. markets, the risks of downfall are even higher as this year's recovery is not sector agnostic; instead, it is focused on a handful of sectors such as artificial intelligence that have provided investors an opportunity to break out from the dour sentiment of 2022.At this point, you might be wondering what were those statements by Chair Powell that once again spooked investors. Well, during his hearing at Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he shared:So you know the risk is that we, the reason we've slowed down really since last December we slowed from 75 to 50 basis points per meeting to 25 at every meeting. And now as we reach, as we get closer and closer to what we believe will be our, it's uncertain, we think our destination is, we've slowed down a little further. So we're trying to avoid the mistake of going too far. And that's all it is. It's, as you can see, overwhelmingly, people on the Committee do believe, it will be appropriate to raise hikes one or two additional times. A strong majority believes two times this year if the economy performs as expected.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great stocks for long term growth, out of which the top picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Interestingly, he will still produce the follow-up seasons of both ""Monster"" and ""The Watcher"" — similar to how he continued to produce FX's ""American Horror Story"" while still at Netflix.Netflix and Disney have not yet commented on the rumored departure.The famed producer joined Netflix in 2018 with a high-profile $300 million contract. Shonda Rhimes also signed with the platform around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal as the streaming giant leaned into a growth-at-all-costs spending strategy and set off an accelerated arms race for content.Flash forward to today, and it's a drastically different environment.Writer/director Ryan Murphy is widely expected to leave Netflix at the end of his current contract. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)A focus on profitabilityRevenue initiatives like ad-supported tiers and password sharing crackdowns have become the industry norm. Virtually every major media company has undergone layoffs and restructured its business in a bid to improve streaming profitability and lessen losses. Price increases have also been implemented (or at the very least teased) in order to improve average revenue per user, or ARPU.Content spending growth has shrunk amid those efforts: ""As we now painfully know, money is no longer cheap,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a note earlier this year.Story continuesFishman predicted a ""flattening in 2023"" when it comes to content spending, which previously enjoyed two strong years of double-digit growth: ""As more companies shift their focus away from solely subscriber growth, we would expect industry content spending to be relatively flat or even decline in the out-years.""Netflix has said its content spend will be flat year-over-year at $17 billion. It will cut costs in other areas with plans to slash its overall spending by about $300 million this year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Netflix declined to comment at the time of that report.""For the longest time, the running industry joke was Netflix would pay for everything and throw as much as they could at the wall and see what sticks,"" Lumley said. ""Content is king. It's still very much prevalent. ...But now with the change in priorities, the idea is that they need to be a bit more strategic.""As Netflix adopts a more strategic approach to driving its content engagement, Wall Street analysts have called out two big drivers of future growth: international content and live sports.Netflix's global pushEarlier this week, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated his $2.5 billion commitment to fund original Korean content over the next four years, adding the company has plans to further expand its original programming to include Korean unscripted series and movies.""I think what’s brilliant is to see film, unscripted and series all grow according to the interests of our Korean audience,"" Sarandos said during an event at Seoul’s Four Seasons Hotel on Wednesday. ""You’ll see the investment in the ecosystem, in front and behind the camera, including training, to grow the industry.""Sarandos' comments come as the company transitions from a Korean content licensor to full-fledged producer, with recent original series like ""The Glory"" and ""All of Us Are Dead"" taking off on the platform.According to Sarandos, about three-fifths of Netflix’s users have watched a Korean show.Netflix's first original Korean title debuted in 2018, illustrating its steady push into local-language films and series over the years. Currently, about two-thirds of Netflix subscribers stem from outside the US.Netflix is entering its next phase of content growth as the company looks to trim costs and boost engagement in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.""In general, shows produced outside of the US can be cheaper while still maintaining a high level of quality, which is definitely advantageous for Netflix,"" Lumley said. ""There's the proven demand of international content, and increased acceptability within US audiences.""Lumley called out the record-breaking performances of international series like ""Squid Game"" and ""Money Heist,"" explaining audiences have become more accustomed to dubbed content, or content that's not in viewers' native language.CFRA analyst Ken Leon added that international content is ""by far"" Netflix's biggest edge over its rivals, telling Yahoo Finance: ""[Netflix's] competitive advantage is their global reach and their ability to move content around the world to specific countries.""Live sports 'will fit well' into Netflix's content strategy

    Live sports content has quickly emerged as another untapped area for Netflix, even as tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL) have snatched up pricey professional sports contracts over the past year.But Netflix has taken its own unique approach by producing docuseries and sports-adjacent content like ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" ""Full Swing,"" and ""Break Point"" instead of committing to big-ticket deals.""I'd say in sports, our position has been the same — we're not anti-sports, we're pro profits,"" Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call in January. ""We've not been able to figure out how to deliver profits in renting big league sports in our subscription model. Not to say that won't change. We'll be open to it, but that's where it's at today.""Experts say Netflix's strategy has created a new opportunity around the untapped potential of sports within the streaming market.""You can see the power of Netflix just in terms of the documentary-style content,"" Jon Christian, EVP of digital media supply chain at media and entertainment-focused consulting company Qvest told Yahoo Finance. ""I think Netflix is solely responsible for F1 being [as popular as it is] in the United States right now.""Christian said Netflix's documentary-style approach helps audiences connect to players, adding, ""This is the way that you could franchise around sports.""Mercedes driver George Russell of Britain drives down pit lane during the first practice session for the Formula One Miami Grand Prix auto race, Friday, May 5, 2023, at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix is in talks to live-stream its first sporting event — a celebrity golf tournament. The event, which is expected to take place sometime this fall, will feature Formula 1 drivers, along with professional golfers, the Journal said. Netflix did not comment on the report.""I think the tournament will be a test for live sports,"" Christian said. ""Netflix is dipping their toe in the water and making sure that they could get all their technology right for live broadcast first.""Netflix's live event efforts took a significant hit in April after the company failed to successfully broadcast its ""Love is Blind"" live reunion special. At the time, Netflix blamed the failure on a technical error but emphasized the platform has the fundamental infrastructure in place to successfully pull off a live event.Overall, Christian said Netflix may have to eventually pay up for a professional sports contract as ""sports is the last frontier of the cord cutters.""Morgan Stanley analysts agree, writing in a new report published on Wednesday, ""Eventually we expect Netflix to move into live sports, particularly as it scales in [free cash flow] generation and has the ability to invest in major sports rights around the world. In addition, as its advertising capabilities scale, we think live sports will fit well into its content offering.""""Netflix has consistently expanded its product offering, from licensed to originals, from scripted to unscripted, from TV to film, from US to global, and even into games. It is only logical in our view that eventually it will move into live sports — and likely in a big way,"" the analysts added.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

If you want to skip our analysis of the current state of the American economy, then head on over to 5 Beaten Down Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The saga of inflation and interest rate uncertainty that has plagued the stock market for more than a year now seems to be coming to an end. And with it, hopefully, the turmoil that was ushered in by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic's after effects are still being felt in the economy today in the form of high inflation. This inflation first started to surface as the money pumped into the economy as part of stimulus spending increased purchasing powers, and then the Russian invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the problem.This forced the Federal Reserve, which had initially delayed raising interest rates, to rapidly hike them in an attempt to constrain economic growth. These interest rate hikes have persisted this year, albeit in a more toned down manner. They've also made their mark on the banking sector, with the failure of several large banks unable to meet customer commitments in the wake of rapidly devaluing asset bases.However, all this saga, which has created a laser focus among analysts, economists, and business people on key macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rates and the labor market, seems to be coming to an end. June has been mostly a good month for those hoping that the Federal Reserve will not increase interest rates. At the start of the month, the Labor Department released the jobs report for May, showing that the economy had added 339,000 new jobs - surpassing estimates - but unemployment rates had also ticked up.However, soon afterward, markets were given a breath of fresh air as the data for unemployment insurance claims rolled in. This data, which was for the week ending on June 3rd, has a lower time lag and represents one of the closest snapshots of the economy due to its temporal proximity. And voila! This data showed that claims had jumped by 28,000 during the week. Not only did this beat analyst estimates, but the claims fell just 3,000 short of the recent record set during the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesBuilding on this, as June's second week comes to a close, the Labor Department was out with some more good news. Its latest data shows that as a whole, inflation in May ticked up by just 0.1% for the lowest level since March 2021. As a whole, annual inflation sits at 4%, back to the levels that it was in March 2021. However, the price drops were not unanimous or across the board. A deep dive into the labor department's data shows that energy, fuel, and utility prices 'fueled' the lower inflation reading. On the flip side, non core inflation, one which measures the prices of everything apart from food and energy, jumped by 0.6% and was aided in this trend to a large extent by the prices of used cars and trucks. Two additional key contributors to inflation, the prices of both of which accelerated in May are shelter and transportation services. Annually, the prices for these have jumped by 8% and 10.2%, respectively.However, this positive inflation data might not mean that the Fed's interest rate hike cycle is over. At least that's what economists polled by the Financial Times believe. While the current Fed discount rate sits at 5.25%, economists believe that the Fed might raise this to as high as 6% to ensure that high inflation does not become a permanent part of the American economy. The Fed's long term inflation goal is 2% after all, and a reading of 4% in May is still double that amount.After the latest data release, the S&amp;P 500 jumped by 0.48% and the NASDAQ appreciated by 0.52%, while the U.S. dollar weakened. Yet, just because markets are up doesn't mean you should be complacent. That's what billionaire Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments believes, as he thinks that not only does a lack of corporate experience at the Federal Reserve and Congress create the potential for negative impacts from excessive regulations particularly in the wake of the mini banking crisis this year, but there might be conflict brewing in places nobody is talking about. One such example according to him is:. . one that nobody talks about, that I'm watching very closely, and has not up blown up and I surely hope it does not is conflict between India and Pakistan. Two nuclear powers. Neighbors. Traditionally hostile to each other. And, where India was benefiting last year from discounted oil Russia had to be able to sell, so India got it cheaply. One of the few countries last year that did as Russia had to put out more oil than ever before because of the Western sanction that deprived it of its traditional industrial base. Now, Pakistan's getting a lot of that, taking oil away from India, building the tension between them.And remember that India at one level is like the top of a triangle, almost like a irregularly shaped diamond with Pakistan on the one side and China on the other. So if you get a hot conflict, we would be facing unfortunately two major economic forces, three nuclear powers, all in one geography. And the potential for geopolitical haywire where we already are stretched thin because we have to worry about Russia, we have to worry about Taiwan, there's only so many theaters we can already operate in at the same time that our military is already stretched and we have limited theater capability. We don't have the ability to use any material force to calm down that region. We're not particularly loved in Pakistan anyway. And our relationship with India has gotten frostier. So therefore this could really go haywire. It's things that we don't see, that we don't talk about, that blow up that are the biggest risks always.Yet, as the markets have plummeted this year, this has created opportunities to get into stocks that have fallen with the market.

If you want to skip our primer of the food industry, profitability, and entrepreneurship in general, then head on over to 5 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the World. Food is directly tied to human progress. This is because the sole reason humanity was able to progress as a civilization instead of living in hunting and gathering as tribes was that humans were able to settle down in societies to grow their own food and coalesce their resources.Since then, the world, and the food industry have come quite far. Global caloric consumption has grown as we have been able to drastically increase our food production due to advances in agricultural mechanization. And this will continue to grow in the future as well according to data from the United Nations. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) estimates, global caloric consumption will grow from 2,789 kilocalories per person in 2000 to 3,139. kilocalories by 2050 for a 12% growth.So it's clear that food is here to stay, and the ongoing global population growth provides opportunities for entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is the process of setting up a new business to make a profit and take financial risks in the process. It is also the heart of capitalism and economic growth, with the process of disrupting existing industries with new ideas first defined as 'Creative Disruption' by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter as far back as 1946. And since Mr. Schumpeter's time, the food industry has produced some of the biggest and most profitable companies in human history.One of these, which is a household name is none other than the fast food giant McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). In its latest fiscal year, McDonald's raked in $6.1 billion in net profit - higher than the foreign reserves of several developing countries. This lends the firm a profit margin of 26% - indicating that it brings 26 cents on a dollar to the coffers of shareholders and investors. But, McDonald's isn't the biggest food company in the world. Instead, that title goes to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Coca-Cola earned $9.5 billion in revenue in the twelve months ending in December 2022, for a profit margin of 22% - just a little lower than McDonald's despite selling different kinds of products.Story continuesAs a whole though, McDonald's is several times more profitable than the restaurant industry. This is because the restaurant and dining industry has a profit margin of 9% according to estimates from the renowned Professor Aswanth Damodaran of the New York University's Stern School of Business. And, Coca-Cola is also more profitable than the beverages industry, with the soft drink industry having a profit margin of 14.6%.Just as technology has disrupted a variety of other industries, it is also making its impact on the food industry as well. One such example comes from the food technology unicorn NotCo. This interesting company sits at the heart of the intersection of today's hottest technology scene, artificial intelligence, the push to environmental sustainability, and the food industry. Its platform, Giuseppe, has the potential of becoming the darling of environmental activists and vegetarians since it uses algorithms to first scan the texture and other details of animal based ingredients to find their purely plant based substitutes. NotCo raised $70 million in Series D1 funding in December 2022 to scale up Giuseppe to allow other firms to use it as well. NotCo currently sells its own food products as well, under 'ear catching' titles such as NotChicken, NotMilk, and NotBurger.NotCo is truly a unicorn since most investor attention in the food entrepreneurship scene goes to different segments of the food chain according to researchers from the University of Hohenheim in Germany. They analyzed investments in start ups in the food value chain between 2013 and 2017 to conclude that packaging, agriculture, and shipping are some areas that received the most funding.Finally, the food industry is naturally quite resilient in tough macroeconomic environments, and since we're in the midst of one right now, comments from McDonald's executives made during the firm's latest earnings call are worth noting. McDonald's is following an approach called 'intrapreneurship' where big firms apply an entrepreneurial strategy to their affairs:We’re calling this Accelerating the Organization. In March, we convened our Annual Leadership Summit with top leaders from across the globe. Part of this meeting, we discussed three changes to our ways of working that will enable us to leverage our scale more effectively to meet the needs of our system and customers and unlock significant growth potential. The first is implementing horizontal ways of working. For years, our organization like many others was too siloed, whether that be geographically siloed or functionally siloed, and yet our biggest challenges and opportunities are rarely limited to just one market. They can’t be solved by only one function. They require collaborating across the organization to bring the full breadth of McDonald’s skills and experiences to devise the best system solution that can be scaled globally.In other words, they need to be solved horizontally. With Accelerating the Organization, we’re now structured to work much more seamlessly in a horizontal fashion to solve these problems once and then scale solutions across markets, for example, is our app offering a seamless and personalized user experience. We’re continuing to increase our speed of service. Those are opportunities across every single market and require the expertise of multiple functions. To support our ambition, to scale innovations with greater agility and collaborate more effectively, our second key shift is adopting One McDonalds Way to standardize the common processes we use to drive consistency and enable speed. We’re an innovative entrepreneurial organization, but once a part of our system somewhere has solved a problem or developed a novel idea, we need to stop the work elsewhere.We don’t need every market to invent its own light bulbs, so to speak.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable food businesses in the world.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136Index Weight: 0.579798%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) ranks 30th on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks by index weight.

(NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Index Weight: 0.589363%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the American retail giant, ranks 28th on our list of the top 30 S&amp;P 500 stocks measured by index weight. On May 18, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.47 and a revenue of $152.3 billion, topping Wall Street consensus by $0.15 and $4.39 billion, respectively.

It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”27. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Index Weight: 0.606184%Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, ranks 27th on the S&amp;P 500 list by index weight. On June 22, Pfizer Inc.

(NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”26. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), an American multinational computer software firm, announced its Q2 2023 financial results on June 15. The company reported a non-GAAP EPS of $3.91 and a revenue of $4.82 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.12 and $50 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 database, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was part of 99 hedge fund portfolios, with collective stakes worth $7.3 billion. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest position holder in the company, with a stake valued at $731.5 million. Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight. On May 25, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported an FQ3 non-GAAP EPS of $3.43, beating market consensus by $0.12. The revenue of $53.65 billion, however, fell short of Wall Street estimates by $930 million. Net sales for the quarter grew 1.9% to $52.60 billion, up from $51.61 billion in the prior-year quarter.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 63 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 66 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 861,306 shares worth about $428 million. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). On April 26, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on July 3, to shareholders of record on June 16. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Index Weight: 0.664454%AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an American pharmaceutical company that ranks 23rd on the S&amp;P 500 index based weight. On April 27, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $2.46, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.03. The revenue of $12.23 billion came in line with market consensus. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared to 73 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest position holder in the company. Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Index Weight: 0.695779%PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks, with an index weight of 0.69%. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP), with combined stakes worth $4 billion. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.65 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) announced that it will commit $3.3 million in funds toward water replenishment projects across North America. These projects aim to reduce absolute water use and replenish back into the local watershed more than 100% of the water used at company-owned and third-party sites in high water-risk areas.”21. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Index Weight: 0.730999%The American oil and gas giant, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ranks 21st on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. On April 28, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $3.55 and a revenue of $50.79 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.14 and $1.3 billion, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 64 hedge funds were bullish on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $21.60 billion. Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”20. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) also specializes in animal health products. The stock ranks 20th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on weight. On May 23, Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

The dividend is payable on July 10, to shareholders of record on June 15. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were long Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), compared to 77 funds in the earlier quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.8 million shares worth $298.4 million. Aristotle Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Founded in 1891 and headquartered in New Jersey, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms. The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster drug Keytruda.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8.

Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Inverse Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.""It's Like They Don't Care About The Debt Ceiling Negotiations At All""In a recent episode of Mad Money, aired on May 23, Jim Cramer discussed the surprising market reaction to the ongoing debt ceiling talks and provided insights into the sectors that may be impacted if the government defaults on its debt. According to Cramer, despite the potential risks, the market showed resilience as investors focused on growth stocks and seemingly brushed off the concerns surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations.Cramer highlighted the noteworthy performance of companies that reported poor earnings but showed strong potential for future growth. Tech stocks, particularly cybersecurity stocks, remained in demand despite debt ceiling concerns. The market's response indicates that investors believe these companies will continue to thrive, even in the face of a potential crisis.On the other hand, consumer packaged goods companies that have historically rallied during periods of economic uncertainty, experienced a downturn. This divergence in performance suggests that the market is not heavily influenced by concerns about a debt ceiling impasse and remains optimistic about the overall economy. Though the market is not optimistic about these stocks, Cramer thinks these stocks ""are in the sweet spot, even if we crash through the debt ceiling deadline"".Cramer also discussed industries that would likely be impacted if the government were to default on its debt obligations. First, he highlighted that the real estate sector could suffer due to the anticipated rise in long-term interest rates, potentially making mortgages unaffordable. Additionally, banks would face uncertainty and may struggle as well. Utilities and companies heavily reliant on credit, such as those in the heavy machinery, aircraft parts, and auto sectors, could also experience temporary setbacks.Story continuesCramer is known for his outspoken opinions on stocks, and he often makes bold predictions about the market. However, not everyone agrees with Cramer's picks. In fact, some investors believe that the best way to make money in the stock market is to do the opposite of what Cramer says. That's where the Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) comes in.The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) is an actively managed exchange-traded fund designed to generate returns that are opposite to the investment outcomes of Jim Cramer's recommended investments, prior to accounting for fees and expenses. In other words, if Cramer recommends a stock, SJIM will short that stock. If Cramer recommends selling a stock, SJIM will buy that stock. Some of the most notable inverse Cramer stocks that Wall Street analysts see material upside to include Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN), and PayPal Holdings, Inc.

While no guarantees exist for anything, those who focus on investing in biotech own a clear advantage. Almost surely, the underlying sector – which falls under the broad healthcare industry – is permanently relevant.Further, I submitted a query on ChatGPT to extract key reasons why biotech stocks for retirement make sense. Primarily, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot pointed to the potential for long-term growth. Given that the industry commands the forward capabilities of developing innovative treatments and therapies for various diseases and medical conditions, the top biotech enterprises enjoy ongoing pertinence.Second, ChatGPT identified demographic trends. Per the chatbot, “[a]s the global population continues to age, there is an increasing demand for healthcare and medical solutions. Biotech companies are at the forefront of developing novel drugs, therapies, and diagnostics to address these needs.” Because of the underlying relevance, the biotech space offers some of the most secure retirement stocks available.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmgen (AMGN)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comOne of the powerhouses among biotech stocks for retirement, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a top-level independent biotechnology firm. At the moment, the company commands a market capitalization of just over $122 billion. Since the start of this year, AMGN has been on shaky ground, losing about 13% of its equity value.Nevertheless, ChatGPT states that Amgen has a strong track record of developing innovative therapies for various diseases. It features a diversified portfolio of drugs, including treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Also, the company has a history of consistent revenue growth and has demonstrated stability in the biotech sector. Thus, it’s an appropriate idea for retirement planning stocks.Story continuesFinancially, Amgen benefits from a decent Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, indicating high operational efficiency. In addition, the company prints a trailing-year net margin of 30.23%, above 95.48% of its rivals. Finally, it presents a solid discount. Right now, the market prices AMGN at a forward multiple of 12.9. As a discount to projected earnings, Amgen ranks better than 63.85% of the competition.Gilead Sciences (GILD)Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotechSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageAnother high-level entity among retirement planning stocks in the biotech sphere, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) focuses on researching and developing antiviral drugs. During the early months of the Covid-19 crisis, Gilead’s name popped up as a possible treatment provider for the underlying disease. Currently, the company carries a market cap of almost $99 billion. Since the start of the year, GILD dipped over 7%.Despite the red ink, ChatGPT identifies Gilead as a great candidate for those investing in biotech stocks for retirement. Specifically, the company has a robust pipeline of products and a strong financial position. As well, Gilead has a history of generating significant cash flow, which can be attractive for retirement investors seeking stability and dividend potential.Speaking of which, Gilead carries a forward yield of 3.8%. This rates much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Further, the payout ratio – or the amount of earnings after tax that are paid out to shareholders – sits at a very sustainable 41.69%. Lastly, Gilead enjoys eight years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)OLK Stock. Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk. Advanced Scientific Lab for Medicine, Biotechnology. Blue Color. KZR stock. RSLS stockSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comA high-flying example of retirement planning stocks, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the first biotechs to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry, according to its public profile. Presently, Vertex carries a market cap of just under $90 billion. Since the beginning of this year, VRTX gained over 22% of its equity value.Seemingly, VRTX continues to rise from strength to strength, gaining over 39% in the trailing one-year period. Thus, it’s an enticing candidate for high-growth biotech stocks. Per ChatGPT, the biotech has been successful in bringing innovative therapies to market that have significantly improved the lives of cystic fibrosis patients. In addition, Vertex has a dominant position in the CF market and continues to invest in research and development, making it a potential long-term growth opportunity for those investing in biotech stocks for retirement.As expected, Vertex financially benefits from strong top and bottom-line performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis hits 29.2%, above 74.54% of its peers. Its trailing-year net margin stands at an impressive 35.4%.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comAnother high-profile name among retirement planning stocks that attracted attention during the pandemic, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) originally focused on neurotrophic factors and their regenerative capabilities, giving rise to its name. Right now, Regeneron carries a market cap of just under $86 billion. Since the beginning of this year, REGN gained nearly 9% of its equity value.Per ChatGPT, Regeneron forged a reputation for discovering, developing, and commercializing medicines for serious medical conditions. It has a strong research and development pipeline with a particular emphasis on monoclonal antibodies. Regeneron also has a history of successful drug launches and partnerships, making it an attractive choice for those seeking secure retirement stocks. Onto the financials, Regeneron’s greatest strength arguably lies in its excellent profitability metrics. Both its trailing-year operating and net margins clock in above 33%, well outpacing the underlying sector average rates. Also, the market prices REGN at a forward multiple of 18.63, which is ranked favorably lower than 67.86% of its peers.Biogen (BIIB)Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA StockSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) specializes in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. At the moment, Biogen carries a market cap of just over $43 billion. Since the start of the year, BIIB gained over 9% of its market value. In the trailing 365 days, it skyrocketed almost 56%, making Biogen one of the high-growth biotech stocks.According to ChatGPT, Biogen’s main specialty focuses on the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has developed several innovative therapies for MS and other neurological disorders. Biogen has a solid financial position and a history of consistent revenue growth, which can make it suitable for those seeking secure retirement stocks.Now, the last statement about top-line growth comes with a caveat. Since the catastrophic Covid-19 disaster in 2020, revenue growth declined. Therefore, BIIB represents more of a catch-up play. However, I am inclined to believe in the recovery story, especially if we’re talking about a years-long framework. Per Gurufocus, Biogen features operational efficiency (Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9) and high fiscal stability (Altman Z-Score of 4.64). Also, it commands excellent profitability metrics.Illumina (ILMN)an image of a microscopeSource: ShutterstockBased in San Diego, California, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) develops, manufactures, and markets integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. Per its corporate profile, the company provides a line of products and services that serves the sequencing, genotyping, gene expression, and proteomics markets. Currently, the company commands a market cap of over $33 billion. Since the Jan. opener, ILMN gained almost 5%.According to ChatGPT, Illumina’s technology is widely adopted in research institutions and clinical laboratories worldwide. With the increasing importance of genomics in healthcare, Illumina may offer long-term growth potential. Therefore, ILMN enjoys significant relevancies as one of the top biotech retirement planning stocks. On the financial spectrum, Illumina benefits from key acquisitions to expand its footprint. In 2020, total revenue came out to $3.24 billion. By 2022, this tally jumped to $4.58 billion.To be fair, the company’s aggressiveness has turned off some investors, leading to ILMN trading near five-year lows. Still, this could be an enticing entry point for opportunistic investors of retirement planning stocks.Moderna (MRNA)Should You Buy BPTH Stock After 5-Fold Gain? 3 Pros, 3 Cons to ConsiderSource: ShutterstockOne of the high growth biotech stocks that stormed into the headlines during the Covid-19 crisis, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) provided a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on advanced messenger-RNA (mRNA) technologies. However, the fading of the pandemic has brought steep challenges to MRNA stock. Since the beginning of this year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Right now, the company features a market cap of nearly $50 billion.Still, ChatGPT identifies MRNA as one of the sector-related retirement planning stocks. According to the chatbot, Moderna’s success with its Covid-19 vaccine has demonstrated the potential of mRNA technology, making it an intriguing choice for retirement investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge biotech innovations. Further, the red ink doesn’t always have to imply comprehensively bad news. In part because of the fallout, Moderna appears significantly undervalued, per Gurufocus. Right now, the market prices MRNA at a trailing multiple of 11.23, ranked favorably lower than 83.27% of its peers. Also, the company features an Altman Z-Score of 8.28, indicating an extremely low risk of imminent bankruptcy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

78,f915abc0-cb22-3618-bdd9-cfbe293b5ff3,KO,2023-06-25,20 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-profitable-food-businesses-190050098.html,1687633250,STORY,"['MCD', 'KO']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 most profitable food businesses in the world. If you want to skip our primer of the food industry, profitability, and entrepreneurship in general, then head on over to 5 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the World. Food is directly tied to human progress. This is because the sole reason humanity was able to progress as a civilization instead of living in hunting and gathering as tribes was that humans were able to settle down in societies to grow their own food and coalesce their resources.Since then, the world, and the food industry have come quite far. Global caloric consumption has grown as we have been able to drastically increase our food production due to advances in agricultural mechanization. And this will continue to grow in the future as well according to data from the United Nations. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) estimates, global caloric consumption will grow from 2,789 kilocalories per person in 2000 to 3,139. kilocalories by 2050 for a 12% growth.So it's clear that food is here to stay, and the ongoing global population growth provides opportunities for entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is the process of setting up a new business to make a profit and take financial risks in the process. It is also the heart of capitalism and economic growth, with the process of disrupting existing industries with new ideas first defined as 'Creative Disruption' by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter as far back as 1946. And since Mr. Schumpeter's time, the food industry has produced some of the biggest and most profitable companies in human history.One of these, which is a household name is none other than the fast food giant McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). In its latest fiscal year, McDonald's raked in $6.1 billion in net profit - higher than the foreign reserves of several developing countries. This lends the firm a profit margin of 26% - indicating that it brings 26 cents on a dollar to the coffers of shareholders and investors. But, McDonald's isn't the biggest food company in the world. Instead, that title goes to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Coca-Cola earned $9.5 billion in revenue in the twelve months ending in December 2022, for a profit margin of 22% - just a little lower than McDonald's despite selling different kinds of products.Story continuesAs a whole though, McDonald's is several times more profitable than the restaurant industry. This is because the restaurant and dining industry has a profit margin of 9% according to estimates from the renowned Professor Aswanth Damodaran of the New York University's Stern School of Business. And, Coca-Cola is also more profitable than the beverages industry, with the soft drink industry having a profit margin of 14.6%.Just as technology has disrupted a variety of other industries, it is also making its impact on the food industry as well. One such example comes from the food technology unicorn NotCo. This interesting company sits at the heart of the intersection of today's hottest technology scene, artificial intelligence, the push to environmental sustainability, and the food industry. Its platform, Giuseppe, has the potential of becoming the darling of environmental activists and vegetarians since it uses algorithms to first scan the texture and other details of animal based ingredients to find their purely plant based substitutes. NotCo raised $70 million in Series D1 funding in December 2022 to scale up Giuseppe to allow other firms to use it as well. NotCo currently sells its own food products as well, under 'ear catching' titles such as NotChicken, NotMilk, and NotBurger.NotCo is truly a unicorn since most investor attention in the food entrepreneurship scene goes to different segments of the food chain according to researchers from the University of Hohenheim in Germany. They analyzed investments in start ups in the food value chain between 2013 and 2017 to conclude that packaging, agriculture, and shipping are some areas that received the most funding.Finally, the food industry is naturally quite resilient in tough macroeconomic environments, and since we're in the midst of one right now, comments from McDonald's executives made during the firm's latest earnings call are worth noting. McDonald's is following an approach called 'intrapreneurship' where big firms apply an entrepreneurial strategy to their affairs:We’re calling this Accelerating the Organization. In March, we convened our Annual Leadership Summit with top leaders from across the globe. Part of this meeting, we discussed three changes to our ways of working that will enable us to leverage our scale more effectively to meet the needs of our system and customers and unlock significant growth potential. The first is implementing horizontal ways of working. For years, our organization like many others was too siloed, whether that be geographically siloed or functionally siloed, and yet our biggest challenges and opportunities are rarely limited to just one market. They can’t be solved by only one function. They require collaborating across the organization to bring the full breadth of McDonald’s skills and experiences to devise the best system solution that can be scaled globally.In other words, they need to be solved horizontally. With Accelerating the Organization, we’re now structured to work much more seamlessly in a horizontal fashion to solve these problems once and then scale solutions across markets, for example, is our app offering a seamless and personalized user experience. We’re continuing to increase our speed of service. Those are opportunities across every single market and require the expertise of multiple functions. To support our ambition, to scale innovations with greater agility and collaborate more effectively, our second key shift is adopting One McDonalds Way to standardize the common processes we use to drive consistency and enable speed. We’re an innovative entrepreneurial organization, but once a part of our system somewhere has solved a problem or developed a novel idea, we need to stop the work elsewhere.We don’t need every market to invent its own light bulbs, so to speak.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable food businesses in the world.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight.

Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Index Weight: 0.664454%AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an American pharmaceutical company that ranks 23rd on the S&amp;P 500 index based weight.

(NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc.

AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Index Weight: 0.695779%PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks, with an index weight of 0.69%. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc.

The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%).

Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million. Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

(NYSE:JPM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

UnitedHealth Group was hurt in the quarter as initial rate proposals for Medicare Advantage managed care were more negative than hoped. Fortunately, the final reimbursement rates announced after the quarter are not nearly as ominous.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Index Weight: 1.648476%Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) operates insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses worldwide. It ranks 9th on the S&amp;P 500 index. In Q1 2023, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)’s operating earnings increased 13% year-over-year as insurance underwriting and investment income skyrocketed.

(NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 220Index Weight: 1.7168%With an index weight of 1.71%, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 8th on the S&amp;P 500.

Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Index Weight: 1.727553%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with an index weight of 1.72%, ranks 7th on the S&amp;P 500 list.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 204Index Weight: 1.996184%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 6th on the S&amp;P 500 index, with an index weight of nearly 2%.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and the driving forces behind it, head on over to 5 Best Stocks for Long Term Growth. The last week of June doesn't appear to have glad tidings for the stock market. The first three weeks of the month saw a slew of data releases from the Labor Department, most of which indicated that the Federal Reserve will now consider taking a slower approach to its current interest rate hiking cycle. Consequently, investors had penciled in a fifty basis point increase for the remainder of this year, with this decision reflected in both foreign currency and stock markets.Yet, the market is still quite jittery from the shocks that it has been dealt with over the past year. The recent jitters felt as June's final week kicks off came after fresh remarks by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Mr. Jerome Powell to the U.S. Senate. Chair Powell, who discussed a wide ranging series of topics with senators, commented on the role of the central bank during the multiple failures earlier this year, the determinants behind the Fed's decision to raise interest rates, and whether it will increase rates later this year. While Mr. Powell's statements were in line with market expectations, when combined with the latest developments in key sectors of the U.S. economy, there are worries that more trouble might be headed our way.One such sector is the real estate industry. Real estate is highly receptive to interest rate hikes since both builders require access to capital to finance their projects and buyers need loans or mortgages to make costly purchases. Higher rates slow down the market, and since interest rates are at historic highs these days, the real estate sector is feeling the brunt. Not to mention, the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic saw workers shift to home. This trend has persisted, and a fresh report from Capital Economics believes that office buildings in America are unlikely to regain their pre pandemic values until 2040. With this dour backdrop, the worries of a potential recession and if the Fed's ten interest rate hikes since March 2022 are yet to fully make their impact is driving market downs.Story continuesThe talk of a recession in the economy has been going on for nearly a year now. And this talk seems to have returned now, with another Fed official jumping into the debate of future interest rate hikes. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank Mary Daly shared that two additional interest rate hikes are a real probability for the course of this year. Right now, investors are worried that the Fed might have tightened too fast, and Ms. Daly's comments saw them price in a potential recession down in the future into markets today. As of the early afternoon on June 22nd, the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.658%, the NASDAQ 100 had lost 0.89% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index was down 0.54%.However, talk of the Fed raising interest rates more later this year is not a surprise. Therefore, to explain recent downturns in the stock market, we'll have to look elsewhere as well. And this elsewhere is Europe's economic health. Economies of both France and Germany - two of Europe's biggest - shared disappointing data that made investors flee to the safe haven of treasuries. And those in the U.S. followed as they were already spooked by comments from the Fed officials. For U.S. markets, the risks of downfall are even higher as this year's recovery is not sector agnostic; instead, it is focused on a handful of sectors such as artificial intelligence that have provided investors an opportunity to break out from the dour sentiment of 2022.At this point, you might be wondering what were those statements by Chair Powell that once again spooked investors. Well, during his hearing at Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he shared:So you know the risk is that we, the reason we've slowed down really since last December we slowed from 75 to 50 basis points per meeting to 25 at every meeting. And now as we reach, as we get closer and closer to what we believe will be our, it's uncertain, we think our destination is, we've slowed down a little further. So we're trying to avoid the mistake of going too far. And that's all it is. It's, as you can see, overwhelmingly, people on the Committee do believe, it will be appropriate to raise hikes one or two additional times. A strong majority believes two times this year if the economy performs as expected.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great stocks for long term growth, out of which the top picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).14 Best Stocks for Long Term GrowthSource: Federal Reserve.Chairman Powell presents the Monetary Policy Report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.

For example, as CBS News recently pointed out, the bear market is finally over. Earlier this month, the S&amp;P 500 pushed 20% higher than the trough the equities sector hit in Oct. last year.As well, the May jobs report seemingly renders obsolete the concept of best stock for a volatile market. Specifically, the economy added 339,000 jobs last month, far outpacing projections calling for 190,000. By logical deduction, it appears that fears of a recession have been well overblown. At the same time, historical data for the major equity indices reveal that market sentiment looks bullish until it doesn’t. In other words, you don’t want to base an entire thesis on one technical dynamic. Also, the details of the latest jobs report leave some question marks. For instance, the length of the average workweek declined slightly, translating to a significant impact at scale.Also, job seekers are taking longer to find work, which implies in part that employers may not be offering with great vigor attractive incentives like higher pay or remote work options. Therefore, reliable stocks designed fortuitously as confusing market investments remain surprisingly relevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSRESempra$148.20KRKroger$46.17AFLAflac$69.43Sempra (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7If you’re targeting stable stock picks for investing during market confusion, it’s difficult to overlook Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). For one thing, as a public utility, Sempra benefits from the concept of natural monopolies. Specifically, the barrier to entry for the utility sector is so steep that would-be competitors don’t even try. Given the massive presence that Sempra commands, it easily ranks among the most relevant ideas for confusing market investments.Second, Sempra owns large swathes of the lucrative Southern California market. According to data from Statista, the gross domestic product (GDP) of California came out to $3.59 trillion. While some debate on the topic exists, if California were its own country, it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world. Recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that it’s the fourth largest economy, though that might be a premature assessment.Story continuesHowever, if you want to drill into the granularity, the Golden State represents a massive economic powerhouse. And that means its residents – complain as they might about high prices – generally have the wherewithal to pay them. Therefore, SRE ranks as a relatively easy buy for the best stocks for a volatile market.Kroger (KR)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, grocery store giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) sells itself as one of the best stable stock picks for investing during market confusion. Obviously, no matter how advanced we get as a civilization, humans will always require nutritional sustenance. Kroger provides exactly that, which is why I’m not surprised that it’s up over 3% since the Jan. opener. If anything, it appears underappreciated.Sure enough, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of only 10.26. As a discount to projected earnings, Kroger ranks better than 83.08% of companies listed in the defensive retail segment. Also, it’s noteworthy that shares trade at a trailing sales ratio of 0.23 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.46 times.From the framework of reliable stocks to buy during ambiguous times, Kroger also benefits from the trade-down effect. Basically, when consumers face financial pressures, they will trade down to cheaper alternatives of commonly purchased goods and services. Here, Kroger is the trade-down beneficiary of both dining out and shopping at higher-end grocery stores.Aflac (AFL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comOrdinarily, I’d like to stick an auto insurance firm into a list involving stable stock picks. Because most states in the union require some form of auto insurance, practically everybody has to buy a policy. You can’t get much more of a hostage audience than that. However, supplemental insurance firms like Aflac (NYSE:AFL) may offer a viable alternative.As a supplemental insurance provider, Aflac covers the gaps found in mainline coverage plans. While that might seem a bit of a superfluous purchase – and thus vulnerable to red ink should a down cycle materialize – the Covid-19 crisis likely changed people’s minds on this topic. Essentially, the pandemic taught us that anything can happen, even in this modern age of technical wizardry.Put another way, it’s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. To be fair, Aflac doesn’t offer the greatest read in terms of financial metrics. However, you should note that its greatest strength lies in its excellent profitability. As well, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.41%. While not particularly generous, its payout ratio sits at 27.54. Additionally, Aflac features 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, a status the company will want to hold onto.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Real estate is highly receptive to interest rate hikes since both builders require access to capital to finance their projects and buyers need loans or mortgages to make costly purchases. Higher rates slow down the market, and since interest rates are at historic highs these days, the real estate sector is feeling the brunt. Not to mention, the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic saw workers shift to home. This trend has persisted, and a fresh report from Capital Economics believes that office buildings in America are unlikely to regain their pre pandemic values until 2040. With this dour backdrop, the worries of a potential recession and if the Fed's ten interest rate hikes since March 2022 are yet to fully make their impact is driving market downs.Story continuesThe talk of a recession in the economy has been going on for nearly a year now. And this talk seems to have returned now, with another Fed official jumping into the debate of future interest rate hikes. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank Mary Daly shared that two additional interest rate hikes are a real probability for the course of this year. Right now, investors are worried that the Fed might have tightened too fast, and Ms. Daly's comments saw them price in a potential recession down in the future into markets today. As of the early afternoon on June 22nd, the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.658%, the NASDAQ 100 had lost 0.89% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index was down 0.54%.However, talk of the Fed raising interest rates more later this year is not a surprise. Therefore, to explain recent downturns in the stock market, we'll have to look elsewhere as well. And this elsewhere is Europe's economic health. Economies of both France and Germany - two of Europe's biggest - shared disappointing data that made investors flee to the safe haven of treasuries. And those in the U.S. followed as they were already spooked by comments from the Fed officials. For U.S. markets, the risks of downfall are even higher as this year's recovery is not sector agnostic; instead, it is focused on a handful of sectors such as artificial intelligence that have provided investors an opportunity to break out from the dour sentiment of 2022.At this point, you might be wondering what were those statements by Chair Powell that once again spooked investors. Well, during his hearing at Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he shared:So you know the risk is that we, the reason we've slowed down really since last December we slowed from 75 to 50 basis points per meeting to 25 at every meeting. And now as we reach, as we get closer and closer to what we believe will be our, it's uncertain, we think our destination is, we've slowed down a little further. So we're trying to avoid the mistake of going too far. And that's all it is. It's, as you can see, overwhelmingly, people on the Committee do believe, it will be appropriate to raise hikes one or two additional times. A strong majority believes two times this year if the economy performs as expected.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some great stocks for long term growth, out of which the top picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Index Weight: 0.608314%Next on our list of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with an index weight of 0.60%. Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Index Weight: 0.628673%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the 25th stock in the S&amp;P 500 index, ranked by index weight.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”24. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Index Weight: 0.650008%The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks 24th on the S&amp;P 500 index based on index weight. 2023 marks the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Index Weight: 0.664454%AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an American pharmaceutical company that ranks 23rd on the S&amp;P 500 index based weight.

(NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc.

The company’s drugs are used to treat conditions in a variety of areas, including oncology (~38% of revenue), vaccines (~19%), diabetes (~11%), animal health (~11%) and other (~21%). Merck produced over $48 billion in sales in 2021, just under half of which were generated in the United States. Within oncology, the firm’s immuno-oncology platform is becoming a major contributor to overall sales, driven by the blockbuster drug Keytruda. The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

(NYSE:JPM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

Fortunately, the final reimbursement rates announced after the quarter are not nearly as ominous.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23.

AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc.

The company’s vaccine business is also significant and includes Gardasil for the prevention of HPV (the disease that can lead to cervical cancer in women), as well as vaccines for hepatitis B, pediatric diseases and shingles. In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

(NYSE:JPM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Financials were roiled in the quarter thanks to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

UnitedHealth Group was hurt in the quarter as initial rate proposals for Medicare Advantage managed care were more negative than hoped. Fortunately, the final reimbursement rates announced after the quarter are not nearly as ominous.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Index Weight: 1.648476%Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) operates insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses worldwide.

(NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.8. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 220Index Weight: 1.7168%With an index weight of 1.71%, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 8th on the S&amp;P 500.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Index Weight: 1.727553%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with an index weight of 1.72%, ranks 7th on the S&amp;P 500 list. These are class C shares, and shareholders have no voting rights. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $1.17 and a revenue of $69.79 billion, topping Wall Street consensus by $0.10 and $950 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 155 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 152 funds in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 204Index Weight: 1.996184%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 6th on the S&amp;P 500 index, with an index weight of nearly 2%. GOOGL shares are class A shares and allow one vote per share. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 204 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), compared to 209 funds in the last quarter. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

It’s not sellers, many of whom are not even in the game. Those who are aren’t ahead, either, because they'll eventually become buyers.The winner — or winners? The homebuilders.An imbalance in supply and demand — brought on by the down-then-up path mortgage rates took since the start of the pandemic — has been a boon to builders.And they know it, too.Confidence among builders finally pushed into positive territory this month, the first time in 11 months, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Expectations for current sales, and sales six months down the line, were also cheery.“There is so little inventory available on the resale side that it's pushing buyers to pay the premium for new as compared to resell because there just isn't a lot out there that's desirable for them,"" KB Home Chairman, President, and CEO Jeffrey Mezger said this week on the builder’s investor call. ""So we're pretty pleased.""KB Home (KBH) was the latest builder to turn in better-than-expected quarterly earnings and rosier guidance, following the same path as D.R. Horton (DHI), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Brothers (TOL) and Lennar Corp. (LEN)That enthusiasm has translated into more shovels in the ground.Single-family housing starts in May jumped 18.5% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 997,000, according to government data released this week. Building permits for single-home construction rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 897,000 units, up 4.8% from April.""We have not seen that level in the 10 years prior to the pandemic,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above.) ""So builders are ramping up. Their profits are turning in. And there's a financial incentive to produce more.""Story continuesHappy days: A Toll Brothers housing development Carlsbad, California. (REUTERS/Mike Blake) (Mike Blake / reuters)Those homes are sorely needed, largely because current owners hold favorable mortgages. Why would you want to sell only to turn around and buy another, more expensive home, with a mortgage rate that’s twice as high?You wouldn't.The numbers tell the story: Practically all homeowners with a mortgage have a current mortgage rate below 6%, Redfin reported last week. About 4 in 5 homeowners with mortgages have an interest rate below 5%, and nearly a quarter have a rate below 3%, likely when they refinanced during the pandemic when rates hit all-time lows.So while the number of previously owned homes on the market did increase in May to 1.08 million units, that's still below the pre-pandemic norm of 1.9 million homes, according to the NAR's release on existing home sales. The total was the lowest count on record for the month of May.Redfin, per new data, also found that the number of houses for sale in the US hit a new low in May.""The tight existing inventory environment has been a tailwind for new home sales,” James Egan, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""In fact, new home sales made up the largest share of total transactions in the first quarter of the year since 2006.""More good news for homebuilders: Egan revised his forecast for home prices, expecting no growth for the year versus his prior expectation of a 4% decline.But there's hope for potential buyers of existing homes: mortgage rates show signs of retreat.Freddie Mac (FHL.SG) said rates have softened in the last three weeks — down to 6.67%. And this week Realtor.com revised its forecast for mortgage rates, predicting the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage will average 6.4% throughout the year, and hit 6.1% by end of year. That’s lower than its previous estimate of 7.4% throughout the year and 7.1% by year-end.So would 6% be enough to revive the resale market?""There’s no magic number because it’s probably different for every homeowner,"" First American Financial Corp. Chief Economist Mark Fleming told Yahoo Finance. But ""it’s likely that rates would need to be a lot closer to 5% than 7% in order to reduce the rate lock-in financial penalty for most homeowners.""Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

For example, as CBS News recently pointed out, the bear market is finally over. Earlier this month, the S&amp;P 500 pushed 20% higher than the trough the equities sector hit in Oct. last year.As well, the May jobs report seemingly renders obsolete the concept of best stock for a volatile market. Specifically, the economy added 339,000 jobs last month, far outpacing projections calling for 190,000. By logical deduction, it appears that fears of a recession have been well overblown. At the same time, historical data for the major equity indices reveal that market sentiment looks bullish until it doesn’t. In other words, you don’t want to base an entire thesis on one technical dynamic. Also, the details of the latest jobs report leave some question marks. For instance, the length of the average workweek declined slightly, translating to a significant impact at scale.Also, job seekers are taking longer to find work, which implies in part that employers may not be offering with great vigor attractive incentives like higher pay or remote work options. Therefore, reliable stocks designed fortuitously as confusing market investments remain surprisingly relevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSRESempra$148.20KRKroger$46.17AFLAflac$69.43Sempra (SRE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7If you’re targeting stable stock picks for investing during market confusion, it’s difficult to overlook Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE). For one thing, as a public utility, Sempra benefits from the concept of natural monopolies. Specifically, the barrier to entry for the utility sector is so steep that would-be competitors don’t even try. Given the massive presence that Sempra commands, it easily ranks among the most relevant ideas for confusing market investments.Second, Sempra owns large swathes of the lucrative Southern California market. According to data from Statista, the gross domestic product (GDP) of California came out to $3.59 trillion. While some debate on the topic exists, if California were its own country, it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world. Recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that it’s the fourth largest economy, though that might be a premature assessment.Story continuesHowever, if you want to drill into the granularity, the Golden State represents a massive economic powerhouse. And that means its residents – complain as they might about high prices – generally have the wherewithal to pay them. Therefore, SRE ranks as a relatively easy buy for the best stocks for a volatile market.Kroger (KR)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, grocery store giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) sells itself as one of the best stable stock picks for investing during market confusion. Obviously, no matter how advanced we get as a civilization, humans will always require nutritional sustenance. Kroger provides exactly that, which is why I’m not surprised that it’s up over 3% since the Jan. opener. If anything, it appears underappreciated.Sure enough, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of only 10.26. As a discount to projected earnings, Kroger ranks better than 83.08% of companies listed in the defensive retail segment. Also, it’s noteworthy that shares trade at a trailing sales ratio of 0.23 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.46 times.From the framework of reliable stocks to buy during ambiguous times, Kroger also benefits from the trade-down effect. Basically, when consumers face financial pressures, they will trade down to cheaper alternatives of commonly purchased goods and services. Here, Kroger is the trade-down beneficiary of both dining out and shopping at higher-end grocery stores.Aflac (AFL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comOrdinarily, I’d like to stick an auto insurance firm into a list involving stable stock picks. Because most states in the union require some form of auto insurance, practically everybody has to buy a policy. You can’t get much more of a hostage audience than that. However, supplemental insurance firms like Aflac (NYSE:AFL) may offer a viable alternative.As a supplemental insurance provider, Aflac covers the gaps found in mainline coverage plans. While that might seem a bit of a superfluous purchase – and thus vulnerable to red ink should a down cycle materialize – the Covid-19 crisis likely changed people’s minds on this topic. Essentially, the pandemic taught us that anything can happen, even in this modern age of technical wizardry.Put another way, it’s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. To be fair, Aflac doesn’t offer the greatest read in terms of financial metrics. However, you should note that its greatest strength lies in its excellent profitability. As well, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.41%. While not particularly generous, its payout ratio sits at 27.54. Additionally, Aflac features 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, a status the company will want to hold onto.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the S&amp;P 500 index, head over to Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight. The S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the tech-heavy NASDAQ, edged higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest rate hikes are not over yet, but the Fed would be more considerate in its monetary policies this time. As per CME's FedWatch tool, Wall Street forecasts a 77% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate hike by the end of July. In light of Powell’s latest comments, the S&amp;P 500 gained 16.2 points, with its consumer discretionary sector performing the best. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York, told Reuters on June 22: ""The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary. In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases.""Don't Miss: 20 Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2023The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. The index weighs stocks based on their market value, so more valuable companies automatically rise to the top. This is also a safer approach as huge corporations are usually more reliable, especially during economic turmoils and market upheavals. This year, the S&amp;P 500 is riding market highs primarily due to the tech stocks that are experiencing an AI-led rally. AJ Bell, a British online provider of investment platforms and stockbroker services, observed that AI champions like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have collectively gained $3.1 trillion in market cap during 2023. However, if their massive contribution to the S&amp;P 500 is excluded, the benchmark index has lost $286 billion in 2023 as of June 3. Investors are pouring their money into top-notch low risk tech giants, and they are now treated like traditional safe haven assets. Financial Times cited Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics, who noted that historical bull markets by the end of 1990s and between 2019 and 2021 had similar indicators. A couple of huge companies were leading the market rallies. However, keeping in mind the previous stock market bubbles that eventually burst, Matthews commented: Story continues“If we’re right that growth will falter later this year . . . we suspect some pain is on the way for the S&amp;P 500, and global equities generally.""Investors are looking for safe haven stocks in the midst of economic chaos, and they are leaning towards the top S&amp;P 500 constituents like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”25.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year's forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”23.

AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”22. PepsiCo, Inc.

In recent years, Merck has been shifting its focus toward unmet medical needs in specialty-care areas. As part of this shift in focus, in June 2021, Merck received $9 billion from the spinoff of its women’s health, established brands, and biosimilars businesses into the now independent, publicly traded company Organon…” (Click here to read the full text)19.

Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double-digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e-commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”17.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”16.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—US Bank (USB), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil. For example, JP Morgan, one of the banks deemed “too-big-to-fail,” has benefited from an inflow of deposits from smaller institutions. As such, the Fund took advantage of the volatility in the quarter and added to its position.With the selloff in the quarter, we have added to US Bank selectively, but more so to JPMorgan as it appears better positioned to gather deposits in the current environment.”11.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, were up 76.0% this quarter due to decisive cost discipline actions, improving adoption of new advertising products, the company’s work in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the broader rally in technology stocks. Meta is the mega-cap technology company most focused on profitability through cost cutting, including layoffs of more than 20% of its staff and reductions in its data center and office footprint. On the top line, Meta continues growing its user base with daily average users up 5% year-over-year in the last quarter. Engagement remains healthy with impressions up 23% year-over-year, and newer advertising formats (like Instagram Reels) are reportedly picking up steam with 40% of advertisers now using Reels. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, and technological scale to sustain durable growth for years to come, with further monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as WhatsApp.”7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Index Weight: 1.727553%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with an index weight of 1.72%, ranks 7th on the S&amp;P 500 list. These are class C shares, and shareholders have no voting rights. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $1.17 and a revenue of $69.79 billion, topping Wall Street consensus by $0.10 and $950 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 155 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 152 funds in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“As we have mentioned in previous months, we have slowly reduced our underweight position in the Technology sector over the past several years, as we have added a number of names that fit our investment strategy. Many of these investments had impressive returns in the quarter and our relative performance in the tech sector was a bright spot. Four out of our top 5 performing names in the quarter were either Technology or Technology-related names, including: NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Littelfuse (LFUS), and Microsoft (MSFT). The stocks all benefited from a positive shift in investor sentiment in the quarter toward growth stocks, reversing last year’s trend. NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Microsoft also all benefited from their exposure to artificial intelligence and the headlines garnered from the widespread launch of ChatGPT a large language model developed by Microsoft partner, OpenAI. In the current tight labor market, there is a lot of enthusiasm around the efficiency this technology could bring to many industries. Alphabet and Microsoft are working furiously to build it into their products and NVIDIA has benefited as it currently has the best hardware to train and run large AI algorithms.”6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 204Index Weight: 1.996184%Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 6th on the S&amp;P 500 index, with an index weight of nearly 2%. GOOGL shares are class A shares and allow one vote per share. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 204 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), elite hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what Crescat Capital has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we think the biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.”Click to continue reading and see Top 5 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index Weight.    Suggested articles:10 Largest Rare Earth Companies in the World15 Best Places to Retire in Texas11 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Disclosure: None.

92,f176fa29-05e5-3d1b-995d-ea470e101012,REGN,2023-06-25,How to Retire Rich: Biotech Stocks Edition,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retire-rich-biotech-stocks-edition-205610558.html,1687121770,STORY,"['REGN', 'AMGN', 'MRNA', 'ILMN', 'VRTX', 'GILD', 'BIIB']","[Among the most difficult endeavors when it comes to deciphering the best retirement planning stocks is to identify companies that will remain relevant for years, if not decades to come. While no guarantees exist for anything, those who focus on investing in biotech own a clear advantage. Almost surely, the underlying sector – which falls under the broad healthcare industry – is permanently relevant.Further, I submitted a query on ChatGPT to extract key reasons why biotech stocks for retirement make sense. Primarily, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot pointed to the potential for long-term growth. Given that the industry commands the forward capabilities of developing innovative treatments and therapies for various diseases and medical conditions, the top biotech enterprises enjoy ongoing pertinence.Second, ChatGPT identified demographic trends. Per the chatbot, “[a]s the global population continues to age, there is an increasing demand for healthcare and medical solutions. Biotech companies are at the forefront of developing novel drugs, therapies, and diagnostics to address these needs.” Because of the underlying relevance, the biotech space offers some of the most secure retirement stocks available.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmgen (AMGN)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comOne of the powerhouses among biotech stocks for retirement, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a top-level independent biotechnology firm. At the moment, the company commands a market capitalization of just over $122 billion. Since the start of this year, AMGN has been on shaky ground, losing about 13% of its equity value.Nevertheless, ChatGPT states that Amgen has a strong track record of developing innovative therapies for various diseases. It features a diversified portfolio of drugs, including treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Also, the company has a history of consistent revenue growth and has demonstrated stability in the biotech sector. Thus, it’s an appropriate idea for retirement planning stocks.Story continuesFinancially, Amgen benefits from a decent Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, indicating high operational efficiency. In addition, the company prints a trailing-year net margin of 30.23%, above 95.48% of its rivals. Finally, it presents a solid discount. Right now, the market prices AMGN at a forward multiple of 12.9. As a discount to projected earnings, Amgen ranks better than 63.85% of the competition.Gilead Sciences (GILD)Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotechSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageAnother high-level entity among retirement planning stocks in the biotech sphere, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) focuses on researching and developing antiviral drugs. During the early months of the Covid-19 crisis, Gilead’s name popped up as a possible treatment provider for the underlying disease. Currently, the company carries a market cap of almost $99 billion. Since the start of the year, GILD dipped over 7%.Despite the red ink, ChatGPT identifies Gilead as a great candidate for those investing in biotech stocks for retirement. Specifically, the company has a robust pipeline of products and a strong financial position. As well, Gilead has a history of generating significant cash flow, which can be attractive for retirement investors seeking stability and dividend potential.Speaking of which, Gilead carries a forward yield of 3.8%. This rates much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Further, the payout ratio – or the amount of earnings after tax that are paid out to shareholders – sits at a very sustainable 41.69%. Lastly, Gilead enjoys eight years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)OLK Stock. Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk. Advanced Scientific Lab for Medicine, Biotechnology. Blue Color. KZR stock. RSLS stockSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comA high-flying example of retirement planning stocks, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the first biotechs to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry, according to its public profile. Presently, Vertex carries a market cap of just under $90 billion. Since the beginning of this year, VRTX gained over 22% of its equity value.Seemingly, VRTX continues to rise from strength to strength, gaining over 39% in the trailing one-year period. Thus, it’s an enticing candidate for high-growth biotech stocks. Per ChatGPT, the biotech has been successful in bringing innovative therapies to market that have significantly improved the lives of cystic fibrosis patients. In addition, Vertex has a dominant position in the CF market and continues to invest in research and development, making it a potential long-term growth opportunity for those investing in biotech stocks for retirement.As expected, Vertex financially benefits from strong top and bottom-line performances. Its three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis hits 29.2%, above 74.54% of its peers. Its trailing-year net margin stands at an impressive 35.4%.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comAnother high-profile name among retirement planning stocks that attracted attention during the pandemic, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) originally focused on neurotrophic factors and their regenerative capabilities, giving rise to its name. Right now, Regeneron carries a market cap of just under $86 billion. Since the beginning of this year, REGN gained nearly 9% of its equity value.Per ChatGPT, Regeneron forged a reputation for discovering, developing, and commercializing medicines for serious medical conditions. It has a strong research and development pipeline with a particular emphasis on monoclonal antibodies. Regeneron also has a history of successful drug launches and partnerships, making it an attractive choice for those seeking secure retirement stocks. Onto the financials, Regeneron’s greatest strength arguably lies in its excellent profitability metrics. Both its trailing-year operating and net margins clock in above 33%, well outpacing the underlying sector average rates. Also, the market prices REGN at a forward multiple of 18.63, which is ranked favorably lower than 67.86% of its peers.Biogen (BIIB)Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA StockSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) specializes in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases to patients worldwide. At the moment, Biogen carries a market cap of just over $43 billion. Since the start of the year, BIIB gained over 9% of its market value. In the trailing 365 days, it skyrocketed almost 56%, making Biogen one of the high-growth biotech stocks.According to ChatGPT, Biogen’s main specialty focuses on the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has developed several innovative therapies for MS and other neurological disorders. Biogen has a solid financial position and a history of consistent revenue growth, which can make it suitable for those seeking secure retirement stocks.Now, the last statement about top-line growth comes with a caveat. Since the catastrophic Covid-19 disaster in 2020, revenue growth declined. Therefore, BIIB represents more of a catch-up play. However, I am inclined to believe in the recovery story, especially if we’re talking about a years-long framework. Per Gurufocus, Biogen features operational efficiency (Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9) and high fiscal stability (Altman Z-Score of 4.64). Also, it commands excellent profitability metrics.Illumina (ILMN)an image of a microscopeSource: ShutterstockBased in San Diego, California, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) develops, manufactures, and markets integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. Per its corporate profile, the company provides a line of products and services that serves the sequencing, genotyping, gene expression, and proteomics markets. Currently, the company commands a market cap of over $33 billion. Since the Jan. opener, ILMN gained almost 5%.According to ChatGPT, Illumina’s technology is widely adopted in research institutions and clinical laboratories worldwide. With the increasing importance of genomics in healthcare, Illumina may offer long-term growth potential. Therefore, ILMN enjoys significant relevancies as one of the top biotech retirement planning stocks. On the financial spectrum, Illumina benefits from key acquisitions to expand its footprint. In 2020, total revenue came out to $3.24 billion. By 2022, this tally jumped to $4.58 billion.To be fair, the company’s aggressiveness has turned off some investors, leading to ILMN trading near five-year lows. Still, this could be an enticing entry point for opportunistic investors of retirement planning stocks.Moderna (MRNA)Should You Buy BPTH Stock After 5-Fold Gain? 3 Pros, 3 Cons to ConsiderSource: ShutterstockOne of the high growth biotech stocks that stormed into the headlines during the Covid-19 crisis, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) provided a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on advanced messenger-RNA (mRNA) technologies. However, the fading of the pandemic has brought steep challenges to MRNA stock. Since the beginning of this year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Right now, the company features a market cap of nearly $50 billion.Still, ChatGPT identifies MRNA as one of the sector-related retirement planning stocks. According to the chatbot, Moderna’s success with its Covid-19 vaccine has demonstrated the potential of mRNA technology, making it an intriguing choice for retirement investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge biotech innovations. Further, the red ink doesn’t always have to imply comprehensively bad news. In part because of the fallout, Moderna appears significantly undervalued, per Gurufocus. Right now, the market prices MRNA at a trailing multiple of 11.23, ranked favorably lower than 83.27% of its peers. Also, the company features an Altman Z-Score of 8.28, indicating an extremely low risk of imminent bankruptcy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

93,a6962d99-638b-3834-ae3a-2c23ab229b40,UNP,2023-06-25,Borderlands: Florida tomato growers want US to terminate Mexico trade deal,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/borderlands-florida-tomato-growers-want-110000697.html,1687690800,STORY,"['TSLA', 'UNP']","[The Florida Tomato Exchange said Mexico-based growers continue to dump tomatoes into the U.S. and undercut the domestic market. (Photo: Shutterstock)Borderlands is a weekly rundown of developments in the world of United States-Mexico cross-border trucking and trade. This week: Florida tomato growers want the U.S. to terminate a Mexico trade deal; a Texas border bridge is shut down temporarily by migrant crossings; Union Pacific will provide rail access to an Arizona industrial park; and Tesla issues a second recall for the electric Semi truck.Florida tomato growers want US to terminate Mexico trade dealA trade group is calling on the U.S. to end the 2019 Tomato Suspension Agreement with Mexico, saying it has failed to protect Florida growers against unfair trade practices.The Florida Tomato Exchange (FTE) said Mexico-based growers continue to dump tomatoes into the U.S. — selling them for less than it costs to produce them — and alleging that the cheaper imports undercut the domestic market.“Despite the good faith efforts of the Commerce Department over the last four years, the 2019 Suspension Agreement has not been able to close the loopholes that have always been a problem,” Michael Schadler, the tomato exchange’s executive vice president, said in a statement.The FTE recently filed a request with the Commerce Department to end the agreement because it has “failed to stop unfairly traded Mexican tomatoes from destroying the U.S. tomato industry,” according to a news release.“It’s become clear that these agreements are simply not enforceable, at least when it comes to the tomato trade with Mexico,” Schadler said. “Suspension agreements might be an effective tool for products that can be kept in storage until market conditions improve, but for highly perishable items like fresh tomatoes, there is just too much incentive to evade the reference prices when markets are oversupplied.”Tomatoes sold in the U.S. from Mexico are controlled by the U.S. Department of Commerce through the Tomato Suspension Agreement, which sets minimum pricing and regulates sales between growers and importers.Story continuesFlorida growers have been pushing for more restrictions on Mexican-grown tomatoes for years. Since 1996, the U.S. and Mexico have negotiated five separate agreements regarding tomato imports.In 2019, the FTE lobbied for stricter quality control on Mexican-grown tomatoes and more enforcement of import pricing.As part of the 2019 Tomato Suspension Agreement, Mexico-based growers agreed not to sell tomatoes below a reference price, a seasonably adjusted floor price at which Mexican tomatoes can’t fall underneath and still be exported to the U.S.The 2019 agreement was supposed to protect U.S. tomato growers by eliminating “the injurious effects of Mexican tomatoes, as well as price suppression and undercutting,” according to a news release from the Department of Commerce.“The department’s action brought the Mexican growers to the negotiating table and led to a result that protects U.S. tomato producers from unfair trade,” former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “It also removes major uncertainties for the Mexican growers and their workers.”Following the signing of the 2019 agreement, the FTE said the deal was a “step in the right direction to stop further injury to American farmers caused by dumped Mexico tomatoes.”In 1994, U.S. tomato growers supplied about 80% of the U.S. market while Mexico accounted for 20%, according to the FTE. “Today, Mexico’s share of the U.S. market is almost 70% while U.S. producers have approximately 30%.”In 2022, Mexico exported $2.7 billion worth of tomatoes to the U.S., according to the country’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.The Laredo customs district in South Texas — which includes Laredo’s World Trade Bridge and the Pharr-Reynosa International Bridge in Pharr — accounts for the majority of tomato imports from Mexico, followed by the border crossing in Nogales, Arizona.The Laredo, Texas, customs district accounts for the majority of tomato imports arriving from Mexico to the U.S. Pictured is Laredo’s World Trade Bridge. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)While growers in Florida are urging the U.S. to end the 2019 agreement, officials for the Nogales-based Fresh Produce Association of the Americas (FPAA) said killing the agreement would only result in harming American consumers.“The FTE has been making the same false claims for years, but when pressed to present evidence in regulatory proceedings, they have failed to do so because their claims are untrue, nothing but propaganda intended to skew the political process to their advantage, regardless of the cost to consumers, retailers, and even other American farmers,” Lance Jungmeyer, FPAA president, said in a news release.“The duties that are being sought by the FTE would harm U.S. importers, but would ultimately be paid by American consumers who want better tomatoes, not higher prices, reduced varieties, and lower quality tomatoes.”Texas border bridge shut down temporarily by migrant crossingsMigrant issues forced the closure of the Veterans International Bridge in Brownsville, Texas, for about an hour Thursday.The commercial cargo facilities at the bridge were closed from 6 to 7 p.m., according to Armando Taboada, assistant director of field operations at Customs and Border Protection’s Laredo Field Office.“The Veterans International Bridge resumed normal operations after 7 p.m.,” Taboada said in an email to the trade community on Friday. “The Laredo field office and port directors continue to monitor the migrant situation and are ready to implement our business resumption contingency plans. Truck and railroad shipments continue to be consistent and increasing.”Veterans International Bridge spans the border between the cities of Brownsville and Matamoros, Mexico.Migrant issues forced the closure of the Veterans International Bridge in Brownsville, Texas, for about an hour Thursday.

Located 40 miles from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, the rail park provides access to several major highways, according to a news release.The park’s first tenant, Rehrig Pacific Co., recently broke ground on a 260,000-square-foot injection molding plastics manufacturing plant.“Rehrig Pacific’s groundbreaking represents the first of many exciting opportunities to serve this new industrial park,” Shelly Huckfeldt, UP’s manager of industrial development, said in a statement.Tesla issues 2nd recall for electric Semi truckAutomaker Tesla recently issued a voluntary recall of 36 of its all-electric Class 8 Semi trucks to fix a software update to ensure the side door warning system works properly.Officials for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration discovered that the door-open warning on the truck’s dash only illuminates if the parking brake is disengaged. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards require the warning to be illuminated any time the door is open.Tesla issued its first voluntary recall in March due to a parking brake issue.Production of the Semi was supposed to ramp up to as many as 50,000 units starting in 2024. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said large-scale production of the truck would not begin until 2025, citing battery supply chain constraints.Watch: How do you build a tech roadmap?Click for more FreightWaves articles by Noi Mahoney.More articles by Noi MahoneyDemand for global supply chain intelligence continues to riseToyota investing $328M in Mexico to build hybrid pickupsNational truck dealership exits Texas, blames state regulationsThe post Borderlands: Florida tomato growers want US to terminate Mexico trade deal appeared first on FreightWaves.]"
