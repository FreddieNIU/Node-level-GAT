This compares to earnings of $1.27 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 42.86%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this independent oil and gas company would post earnings of $0.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.99, delivering a surprise of 26.92%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Range Resources , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, posted revenues of $586.32 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.33%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.06 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Range Resources: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Range’s competitive cost structure, low relative capital intensity, liquids optionality and thoughtful hedging allowed us to generate healthy full-cycle margins and maintain our trajectory towards our target capital structure, despite what we expect is a cyclical low in commodity prices. The Range team remains focused on efficiently developing our Marcellus assets to create value for shareholders into what we believe is an improving macro outlook for natural gas and natural gas liquids.”Financial DiscussionExcept for generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) reported amounts, specific expense categories exclude non-cash impairments, unrealized mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives, non-cash stock compensation and other items shown separately on the attached tables. “Unit costs” as used in this release are composed of direct operating, transportation, gathering, processing and compression, taxes other than income, general and administrative, interest and depletion, depreciation and amortization costs divided by production. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of each of the non-GAAP financial measures and the tables that reconcile each of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Story continuesSecond Quarter 2023 ResultsGAAP revenues for second quarter 2023 totaled $637 million, GAAP net cash provided from operating activities (including changes in working capital) was $127 million, and GAAP net income was $30 million ($0.12 per diluted share).  Second quarter earnings results include a $124 million mark-to-market derivative gain due to decreases in commodity prices.Non-GAAP revenues for second quarter 2023 totaled $590 million, and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, a non-GAAP measure, was $187 million.  Adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates, a non-GAAP measure, was $72 million ($0.30 per diluted share) in second quarter 2023.The following table details Range’s second quarter 2023 unit costs per mcfe(a):Expenses 2Q 2023 (per mcfe) 2Q 2022(per mcfe)  Increase (Decrease)       Direct operating(a) $0.13  $0.10  30%Transportation, gathering, processing and compression(a)  1.42   1.70  (16%)Taxes other than income  0.04   0.04  0%General and administrative(a)  0.16   0.17  (6%)Interest expense(a)  0.16   0.21  (24%)Total cash unit costs(b)   1.90    2.22  (14%)Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&amp;A)  0.45   0.46  (2%)Total unit costs plus DD&amp;A(b) $ 2.35  $ 2.68  (12%)(a)   Excludes stock-based compensation, one-time settlements, and amortization of deferred financing costs.(b)   Totals may not be exact due to rounding.The following table details Range’s average production and realized pricing for second quarter 2023(a): 2Q23 Production &amp; Realized Pricing  Natural Gas(Mcf) Oil (Bbl) NGLs(Bbl) Natural GasEquivalent (Mcfe)         Net production per day  1,422,158   7,234   102,532   2,080,752          Average NYMEX price $2.10  $73.98  $21.18   Differential, including basis hedging  (0.47)  (9.71)  0.33   Realized prices before NYMEX hedges  1.63    64.27   21.51   2.40 Settled NYMEX hedges  0.71   (1.73)   —   0.48 Average realized prices after hedges $ 2.34  $ 62.54  $ 21.51  $ 2.88 (a)   Totals may not be exact due to roundingSecond quarter 2023 natural gas, NGLs and oil price realizations (including the impact of cash-settled hedges and derivative settlements) averaged $2.88 per mcfe.The average natural gas price, including the impact of basis hedging, was $1.63 per mcf, or a ($0.47) per mcf differential to NYMEX.

We believe adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates is calculated on the same basis as analysts’ estimates and that many investors use this published research in making investment decisions and evaluating operational trends of the Company and its performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. Diluted earnings per share (adjusted) as set forth in this release represents adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates on a diluted per share basis. A table is included which reconciles income or loss from operations to adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates and diluted earnings per share (adjusted). On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods along with non-GAAP revenue disclosures.Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital (sometimes referred to as “adjusted cash flow”) as defined in this release represents net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital and exploration expense adjusted for certain non-cash compensation items. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is widely accepted by the investment community as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is also useful because it is widely used by professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. A table is included which reconciles net cash provided by operations to cash flow from operations before changes in working capital as used in this release. On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods for cash flow, cash margins and non-GAAP earnings as used in this release.The cash prices realized for oil and natural gas production, including the amounts realized on cash-settled derivatives and net of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, is a critical component in the Company’s performance tracked by investors and professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations and forecasts of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Due to the GAAP disclosures of various derivative transactions and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, such information is now reported in various lines of the income statement. The Company believes that it is important to furnish a table reflecting the details of the various components of each income statement line to better inform the reader of the details of each amount and provide a summary of the realized cash-settled amounts and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, which were historically reported as natural gas, NGLs and oil sales. This information is intended to bridge the gap between various readers’ understanding and fully disclose the information needed.The Company discloses in this release the detailed components of many of the single line items shown in the GAAP financial statements included in the Company’s Annual or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K or 10-Q. The Company believes that it is important to furnish this detail of the various components comprising each line of the Statements of Operations to better inform the reader of the details of each amount, the changes between periods and the effect on its financial results.   We believe that the presentation of PV10 value of our proved reserves is a relevant and useful metric for our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV10 can be used within the industry and by credit and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis.RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) is a leading U.S. independent natural gas and NGL producer with operations focused in the Appalachian Basin. The Company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.  More information about Range can be found at www.rangeresources.com.Included within this release are certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect Range’s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events.  Words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. All statements, except for statements of historical fact, made within regarding activities, events or developments the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as those regarding future well costs, expected asset sales, well productivity, future liquidity and financial resilience, anticipated exports and related financial impact, NGL market supply and demand, future commodity fundamentals and pricing, future capital efficiencies, future shareholder value, emerging plays, capital spending, anticipated drilling and completion activity, acreage prospectivity, expected pipeline utilization and future guidance information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and Range's future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in Range's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless required by law, Range undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date they are made. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves. Range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC. Range uses certain broader terms such as ""resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” ""unproved resource potential"" or ""upside"" or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the SEC's guidelines. Range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications. The SEC’s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC these broader classifications of reserves. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized. Unproved resource potential refers to Range's internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer's Petroleum Resource Management System and does not include proved reserves. Area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by Range's management. “EUR”, or estimated ultimate recovery, refers to our management’s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area. These quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range's interests could differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range's drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. Estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data. In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price or drilling cost changes. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, available from our website at www.rangeresources.com or by written request to 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102.

Growth is certainly something Wall Street and investors are looking for as inflationary concerns begin to ease and market sentiment remains high.Here are three of these stocks that can soothe investors' sentiment in terms of growth, and now appears to be a good time to buy going into their second-quarter reports on Tuesday, July 25.AlphabetWe’ll start with a well-known name in Alphabet as its stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Growth.Of course, Alphabet is intriguing in terms of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities with Bard, a chatbot that aims to rival the popular ChatGPT. The potential for AI to boost other areas of Alphabet’s businesses like Google Cloud and advertising revenue is promising as well.Alphabet is expected to have posted strong second-quarter growth with earnings projected to rise 9% from a year ago at $1.32 per share and sales up 5% to $60.24 billion. Notably, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) also indicates Alphabet could beat earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $1.35 and 2% above the Zacks Consensus.Alphabet’s annual earnings are now forecasted to jump 18% this year and climb another 17% in fiscal 2024 at $6.31 per share. Total sales are projected to rise 6% in FY23 and jump another 10% in FY24 to $274.28 billion.More intriguing is that investors aren’t paying a hefty premium for Alphabet’s growth at the moment. Trading at $121 a share Alphabet stock trades at 22.2X forward earnings which is slightly beneath its industry average of 24.2X and near the S&amp;P 500’s 21.3X.Story continuesEnova InternationalLesser known but very glaring at the moment is Enova International’s stock which boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and “B” Style Scores grade for Growth.Enova is expecting strong quarterly growth as a provider of online financial services, offering loans to customers in the United States, U.K., Australia, and Canada. Stabilizing interest rates should be a catalyst with Enova’s Q2 earnings expected to be up 3% YoY at $1.69 per share. The Zacks ESP indicates Enova should reach its Q2 earnings expectations and sales are forecasted to jump 19% from the prior-year quarter at $485.55 million.Plus, Enova’s annual earnings are forecasted to rise 11% in fiscal 2023 and jump another 15% in FY24 at $8.73 per share with estimates nicely up over the last 60 days. On the top line, sales are expected to climb 16% this year and rise another 11% in FY24 to $2.23 billion.The rising earnings estimate revisions largely attribute to Enova’s Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are a great sign with ENVA shares trading at $56 and just 7.3X forward earnings. This is well below the benchmark and slightly beneath Enova’s industry average of 7.6X.Making a stronger case for consideration is that Enova stock trades 86% below its high of 53.8X over the last five years and closer to the median of 6.5X.NucorSomewhat of a hidden gem this earnings season is leading steel producer Nucor, with its stock sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and “B” Style Scores grade for Growth.Nucor’s Q2 earnings are expected to remain robust at $5.59 per share but have come back to reality after an extremely tough-to-compete-against quarter that saw EPS at $9.67 a year ago. Second-quarter sales are forecasted at $9.73 billion compared to $11.79 billion in Q2 2022.With that being said, the Zacks ESP indicates Nucor could beat earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $5.61 and slightly above the Zacks Consensus.Steel prices have started to drop after skyrocketing amid higher inflation but Nucor’s top and bottom lines remain above historic levels despite a decline naturally expected. Fiscal 2023 earnings are now projected at $18.35 per share and then down to $12.17 a share in FY24.However, FY24 EPS projections would still represent a very stellar 264% growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $3.34 per share. Better still, Nucor stock trades at $166 and 8.9X forward earnings which is near the industry average of 7.8X and attractively beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 21.3X. Nucor stock also trades 78% below its high of 41.8X over the last five years and at a slight discount to the median of 9.3X.Bottom LineIn addition to their attractive growth stories, Alphabet, Enova International, and Nucor’s price-to-earnings valuations support more upside in their stocks. Now appears to be a good time to buy with these companies expected to reach or beat their Q2 earnings expectations and this accompanied with favorable guidance would be a strong catalyst for a rally.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +3.94%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $5.59.While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.Here is how Nucor performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Sales Tons to outside customer (Steel) - Total Steel Mills: 4774 KTon compared to the 4928.58 KTon average estimate based on six analysts.Average Steel Product Price per ton: 2884 $/Ton versus 2751.03 $/Ton estimated by three analysts on average.Average sales price per ton (Steel) - Total Steel Mills: 1168 $/Ton versus 1090.03 $/Ton estimated by three analysts on average.Sales in Tons Outside Customers - Joist: 142 KTon versus 147.63 KTon estimated by two analysts on average.Sales in Tons Outside Customers - Rebar fabrication products: 332 KTon versus 299.71 KTon estimated by two analysts on average.Sales in Tons Outside Customers - Piling: 113 KTon versus 107.78 KTon estimated by two analysts on average.Sales in Tons Outside Customers - Tubular products: 239 KTon versus 284.94 KTon estimated by two analysts on average.Sales Tons to outside customer (Steel) - Sheet: 2404 KTon compared to the 2424.93 KTon average estimate based on two analysts.Sales Tons to outside customer (Steel) - Bars: 1481 KTon versus the two-analyst average estimate of 1502.09 KTon.Sales Tons to outside customer (Steel) - Structural: 399 KTon versus the two-analyst average estimate of 430.65 KTon.Sales Tons to outside customer (Steel) - Plate: 490 KTon versus 447.71 KTon estimated by two analysts on average.Average sales price per ton (Steel) - Sheet: 1103 $/Ton versus 999.05 $/Ton estimated by two analysts on average.Story continuesView all Key Company Metrics for Nucor here&gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Nucor have returned +6.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change.

This compares to earnings of $9.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this steel company would post earnings of $3.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.45, delivering a surprise of 16.80%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Nucor , which belongs to the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, posted revenues of $9.52 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.79 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Nucor shares have added about 24.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.2%.What's Next for Nucor?While Nucor has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Nucor: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.41 on $9.1 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $18.35 on $35.98 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Steel - Producers is currently in the top 11% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Algoma Steel Group Inc.

Earnings in the steel products segment increased in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to increased volumes. The raw materials segment earnings improved in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the improved profitability of our direct reduced iron (""DRI"") facilities.Third Quarter of 2023 OutlookWe expect earnings in the third quarter of 2023 to decrease compared to the second quarter of 2023. We expect earnings for the steel mills segment to decline in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 due to decreased profitability, with the largest impact at our sheet mills. The earnings of the steel products segment are expected to moderate in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2023. Earnings for the raw materials segment are expected to decrease in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 due to margin compression at our DRI facilities and scrap processing operations.Earnings Conference CallYou are invited to listen to the live broadcast of Nucor's conference call during which management will discuss Nucor's second quarter results on July 25, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call will be available over the Internet at www.nucor.com, under Investors.About NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel -- in bars, beams, sheet and plate; hollow structural section tubing; electrical conduit; steel racking; steel piling; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; precision castings; steel fasteners; metal building systems; insulated metal panels; overhead doors; steel grating; wire and wire mesh; and utility structures. Nucor, through The David J. Joseph Company and its affiliates, also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and hot briquetted iron / direct reduced iron; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap. Nucor is North America's largest recycler.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company uses certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures in this news release, including EBITDA. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.Beginning with the second quarter of 2023, we define EBITDA as net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders, adding back the following items: interest expense, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation; and amortization. The Company believes that this revised definition of EBITDA is a more relevant supplemental measure of performance. First quarter of 2023 EBITDA was $1.79 billion using the revised definition. Please note that other companies might define their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do.Management presents the non-GAAP financial measure of EBITDA in this news release because it considers it to be an important supplemental measure of performance. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional insight for analysts and investors evaluating the Company's financial and operational performance by providing a consistent basis of comparison across periods.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this news release are ""forward-looking statements"" that involve risks and uncertainties which we expect will or may occur in the future and may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The words ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""project,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could"" and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's best judgment based on current information, and, although we base these statements on circumstances that we believe to be reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect the accuracy of such forward-looking information. As such, the forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may vary materially from the projected results and expectations discussed in this news release. Factors that might cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressure on sales and pricing, including pressure from imports and substitute materials; (2) U.S. and foreign trade policies affecting steel imports or exports; (3) the sensitivity of the results of our operations to general market conditions, and in particular, prevailing market steel prices and changes in the supply and cost of raw materials, including pig iron, iron ore and scrap steel; (4) the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect our cost of steel production or result in a delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling within our natural gas drilling programs; (5) critical equipment failures and business interruptions; (6) market demand for steel products, which, in the case of many of our products, is driven by the level of nonresidential construction activity in the United States; (7) impairment in the recorded value of inventory, equity investments, fixed assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets; (8) uncertainties and volatility surrounding the global economy, including excess world capacity for steel production, inflation and interest rate changes; (9) fluctuations in currency conversion rates; (10) significant changes in laws or government regulations affecting environmental compliance, including legislation and regulations that result in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our energy costs, capital expenditures and operating costs or cause one or more of our permits to be revoked or make it more difficult to obtain permit modifications; (11) the cyclical nature of the steel industry; (12) capital investments and their impact on our performance; (13) our safety performance; (14) our ability to integrate businesses we acquire; and (15) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, any variants of the virus, and any other similar pandemic or public health situation. These and other factors are discussed in Nucor's regulatory filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including those in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" of Nucor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release speak only as of this date, and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them, except as may be required by applicable law. Tonnage

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Nucor is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NUE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $5.61 per share for NUE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NUE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.30% heading into earnings season.Nucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NUE has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Nucor, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There can be no assurance that actualamounts will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations. Also, refer to our discussion of ""forward-looking statements"" on page 8 of this Earnings Press Release for additional details. Key updates to the midpoints of our guidance ranges for our 2023 key sources and uses of capital include the following:•     During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we pivoted our strategy toward harvesting value by selling 100% interests in non-core properties and/or properties not integral to our mega       campus strategy in lieu of seeking a new real estate joint venture partner for one of our active development projects.      •     This resulted in increases to (i) proceeds from dispositions and sales of partial interests by $225 million, and (ii) our share of construction spending by $210 million, as this amount             was previously expected to be funded by a future joint venture partner.      •     The revised midpoint to our 2023 guidance range for dispositions and sales of partial interests is $1.75 billion.      •     The revised midpoint to our 2023 guidance range for construction spending is $2.9 billion. Total 2023 construction spending before contributions from real estate joint venture partners             remains unchanged from our prior forecast at $3.5 billion.MidpointAs of 7/24/23Key Sources and Uses of CapitalAs of 4/24/23KeyChangesAs of7/24/23RangeMidpointCertainCompletedItemsSources of capital:  Incremental debt$         650$          (15)$         635$         560$         710$         635  Excess 2022 bond capital held as cash at December 31, 2022300—300300300300$            300(1)  Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends375—375350400375  Dispositions and sales of partial interests1,5252251,7501,6501,8501,750$            701(2)  Future settlement of forward equity sales agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2022100—100100100100$            100(3)Total sources of capital before excess cash expected to be held at December 31, 2023$      2,950$         210$      3,1602,9603,3603,160 Cash expected to be held at December 31, 2023(4)$         275$            —$         275125425275Total sources of capital$      3,085$      3,785$      3,435Uses of capital: Construction$      2,725$         210$      2,935$      2,785$      3,085$      2,935 Acquisitions225—225175275225$            235Total uses of capital$      2,950$         210$      3,160$      2,960$      3,360$      3,160Incremental debt (included above): Issuance of unsecured senior notes payable$      1,000$      1,000$      1,000$         1,000(5) Unsecured senior line of credit, commercial paper, and other(440)(290)(365)Net incremental debt$         560$         710$         635(1)Represents $300.0 million of excess 2022 bond capital proceeds held as cash at December 31, 2022, which we used to reduce our 2023 debt capital needs.(2)In addition to completed transactions, we have pending transactions subject to signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements aggregating $175.0 million as of July 24, 2023.(3)Represents outstanding forward equity sales agreements to sell 699 thousand shares of common stock under our ATM program entered into during 2022 and expected to be settled during the second half of 2023.(4)Represents estimated excess 2023 bond capital proceeds expected to be held as cash at December 31, 2023, which reduces our 2024 debt capital needs.(5)Represents $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes payable issued in February 2023. Projected 2023 Earnings per Share and Funds From Operations per Share Attributable to Alexandria's Common Stockholders – DilutedAs of 7/24/23As of 4/24/23Key ChangesEarnings per share(1)$2.72 to $2.78$2.21 to $2.31 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets5.555.55 Gain on sales of real estate(1.26)—(2) Impairment of real estate – rental properties0.980.81(3) Allocation to unvested restricted stock awards(0.04)(0.04)Funds from operations per share(4)$7.95 to $8.01$8.53 to $8.63 Unrealized losses on non-real estate investments0.840.39(3) Impairment of non-real estate investments0.13— Impairment of real estate0.02— Allocation to unvested restricted stock awards(0.01)(0.01)Funds from operations per share, as adjusted(4)$8.93 to $8.99$8.91 to $9.01No change to midpoint;

In April 2023, an investor acquired a 20% interest in this joint venture, which consisted of an 18% interest sold by us and a 2% interest sold by our existing partner. Upon completion of the sale, our ownership interest in the consolidated real estate joint venture was 72% and our existing and new partners' noncontrolling interests were 8% and 20%, respectively. We retained control over this real estate joint venture and therefore continue to consolidate this property. The sales price of the 18% interest sold by us was $66.1 million, or$1,626 per RSF, representing capitalization rates of 6.6% and 5.4% (cash basis). We expect our new joint venture partner to contribute capital approximating $130 million to fund construction of the project over time and to accrete its ownership interest in the joint venture to 37% from 20%.(6)An investor acquired a 70% interest in this consolidated real estate joint venture, which consisted of a 20.1% interest sold by us and a 49.9% interest held by our previous joint venture partner.

We retained control over this real estate jointventure and therefore continue to consolidate this property. This transaction resulted in consideration in excess of book value of $15.6 million and a value-creation margin of 88%. (7)Represents the disposition of 268,023 RSF of a 660,034 RSF near-term development at 421 Park Drive. The proceeds from this transaction will help fund our remaining 392,011 RSF of the project. The project is expected to commence vertical construction later this year and be completed in 2026.

However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that more rate hikes are expected this year. The “dot plot” of the June FOMC showed that the majority of Fed officials expected two more rate hike of 25 basis points each this year.The inflation rate stayed elevated well above the central bank’s 2% target rate despite a stiff fall from its 40-year peak in June 2022. The major concern for the Fed is a resilient U.S. labor market. Although job additions in June were lower than expectations, it was in line with the historical average. Moreover, the wage rate remained sticky downward.Market participants are expecting the Fed to hike the benchmark interest rate again in the July FOMC meeting. At present, the CME FedWatch indicates almost a 100% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25-5.5% in July. No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025.The expectation for the terminal interest rate for the ongoing rate hike cycle is currently 5.6%, instead of the 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting. Several economists and financial experts remained concerned that higher interest rate may lead to a near-term recession.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

(NYSE: CF), today announced a proposal to permanently close the ammonia plant at its Billingham Complex in order to secure the long-term sustainability of its business in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and more efficiently serve its customers in the country. The Company intends to continue to produce ammonium nitrate (AN) fertiliser and nitric acid at the Billingham site using imported ammonia, as it has for the last 10 months following its decision to temporarily idle the plant in August 2022.CF Fertilisers UK has made this proposal due to its forecast that producing ammonia at Billingham will not be cost-competitive for the long-term compared to importing ammonia due primarily to projected high natural gas prices in the United Kingdom relative to other regions and the impact of carbon costs. Additionally, shutdowns in recent years of industrial customers’ U.K. operations that had consumed significant ammonia volumes for their businesses have created a supply-demand imbalance for ammonia production at the Billingham Complex. The Company believes that ample global availability of ammonia for import, including from CF Industries’ North American production network, will enable more cost-competitive and efficient production and sales of ammonium nitrate fertiliser and nitric acid for its U.K. agriculture and chemicals customers moving forward.The Company’s proposal to permanently close the ammonia plant at its Billingham Complex could result in up to 38 redundancies at the site, in relation to which it will be entering into the required collective redundancy consultation process with its recognised union, Unite, and elected employee representatives. The Company anticipates that some of the proposed redundancies might be avoided by redeployment opportunities.Story continuesAbout CF Industries Holdings, Inc.At CF Industries, our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable green and blue hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement and other industrial activities.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Avanos Medical has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that AVNS's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.AVNS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.47, while EW has a forward P/E of 36.36. We also note that AVNS has a PEG ratio of 1.25. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 5.26.Another notable valuation metric for AVNS is its P/B ratio of 0.91. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 9.29.These metrics, and several others, help AVNS earn a Value grade of A, while EW has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesAVNS has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than EW, so it seems like value investors will conclude that AVNS is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Never miss another market-moving headline.Walmart gets upgraded at Piper Sandler Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shares rose more than 1% pre-market today after Piper Sandler upgraded the company to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $210.00 from $145.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.The analyst said the company ""has an opportunity to further extend market gains"" as grocery inflation subsides, adding:While we think intuitive logic dictates that WMT is well positioned during an inflationary period (trade down), we believe that a gradual intensification of promos augurs well for WMT given its sharp focus on price, and we raise our estimates accordingly.Piper also cited the turnaround at Sam's Club, which saw the Walmart-owned warehouse club outperform competitor Costco (NASDAQ:COST for seven consecutive quarters, arguing that this ""remains underappreciated.""The company is set to report its Q2/24 earnings on Aug 17. Street estimates stand at $1.67 for EPS and $159.33 billion for revenues.Shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading to $160.77.Datadog surges on Wolfe Research upgradeDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) shares gained more than 3% pre-market today after Wolfe Research upgraded the company to Outperform from Peerperform with a price target of $140.00 ahead of the company’s upcoming Q2/23 earnings report, scheduled for August 8.Initially, when Datadog was started as Peer Perform, Wolfe’s analysis indicated a potential deceleration in growth due to various factors such as macro, optimization challenges, competition, and go-to-market (GTM) execution. As expected, the growth did slow down significantly (from 63% in 2022 to approximately 25% consensus for 2023). However, despite this deceleration, the valuation of the company has actually expanded. Additionally, recent checks suggest that the optimization challenges are abating, competition is easing, GTM execution has improved, and there are promising Generative AI tailwinds that could position Datadog as one of the fastest-growing software companies.Story continuesSavers Value Village earns bullish coverage initiations from multiple Wall Street firmsSavers Value Village (NYSE:SVV) received coverage initiations from a number of Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs, UBS, Jefferies, Baird, and Piper Sandler, following its IPO last month.Goldman initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a price target of $28.00.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.4%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.52%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 10.86%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest retailer had gained 1.87% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 4.21% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.98% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Walmart as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 17, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.67, down 5.65% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $159.34 billion, up 4.24% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.21 per share and revenue of $636.67 billion, which would represent changes of -1.27% and +4.15%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Walmart. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Walmart is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Looking at its valuation, Walmart is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 25.5. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.62, so we one might conclude that Walmart is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that WMT has a PEG ratio of 4.64.

After all, these retailers are known for their lower prices and, in the case of Costco, bulk goods.I Stopped Shopping at Dollar Tree: Here’s WhyLearn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesBut if you haven’t been shopping at Walmart, you could be missing out on some great savings on high-end items that go for a much higher price elsewhere. Not only does Walmart have a lot to offer when it comes to luxury and high-quality goods, but you can also find many of these deals online as well as in stores.“You might be surprised to hear this, but Walmart isn’t just a destination for everyday essentials,” said James Allen, CPA, CFP, CFEI, and founder of Billpin.com. “It’s also a treasure trove for luxury items that won’t break the bank. For instance, you can find high-end brands like Chanel, Michael Kors, and even Rolex. Yes, you heard me right, Rolex!”If you’re looking for some hidden luxury items at Walmart, here are the top ones to check out.Comforters and BedspreadsIf you’re looking for luxury goods at Walmart, one of the best ways to get started is by checking the retailer’s online page and the listings here. One popular high-end item category you can find at Walmart for less than at major name brands is comforters, sheets and bedspreads. Walmart carries such luxury brands as Home Essence and Home Chic.Here are two options online:Home Essence Apartment All Season Modern Gray Chevron Microfiber Comforters, Full/Queen, $46.76Chic Home Fortuno 12-piece Bed in a Bag Comforter Set, King, $133.62High-End KitchenwareWalmart carries a variety of high-end cookware and other kitchen appliances.See: 10 Walmart Brand Grocery Items That Are Now Cheaper at Aldi“I have had the pleasure of finding some high-end cookware in Walmart at insanely low prices,” said Young Pham, financial advisor and planner with BizReport and a regular deal hunter. “I know different people have different definitions of what high-end cookware means. However, these are basically products that, on a different day, you would end up paying a load of money for. But at Walmart, you could easily get them at massive discounts.”Story continuesCurrent online deals:Berlinger Haus Kitchen Cookware Sets 13-piece, Nonstick Cookware Set, $320.31 (originally $359.90)Berlinger Haus Kitchen Cookware Set 12-piece, Nonstick Cookware Set, $266.91 (originally $299.90)HandbagsWith a large selection of handbags and similar goods, it can be hard to find the hidden gems, but they’re there. “Think of it like this,” said Allen. “Walmart is like a giant treasure chest. You have to dig through a lot of sand and pebbles, but every now and then, you’ll find a gem like a Louis Vuitton handbag or a piece of Alex and Ani jewelry.”Current online deals:Daisy Rose Tote Shoulder Bag and Matching Clutch — PU Vegan Leather Handbag for Travel Work and School, $49.98ANNA by Anuschka Multi Compartment Satchel, $252.00Designer Fragrances“One thing I have always enjoyed buying at Walmart on the cheap is designer fragrances,” said Pham. “These brands would typically cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars, and yet you could still get them for as little as $30 [at] Walmart. I’m not sure if they are real brands selling at huge discounts or knockoffs. But the fact that you are paying way less for something that looks and smells identical to the designer brand is quite astonishing.”Current online deals:Liberty Luxury Legend Perfume for Men, 100ml/3.4Oz, Eau De Toilette Spray, Crafted in France, Oriental &amp; Woody notes, $29.99 (originally $100)CHANEL No. 5 by Chanel Eau De Parfum Premiere Spray, 1.2 oz, $107.95CandlesCandles are another great find at Walmart — and a lovely addition to any home.“Walmart’s Better Homes &amp; Gardens line has been creating products that closely resemble those found in high-end stores like Pottery Barn and Anthropologie. Not only do these items mimic the aesthetic of their more expensive counterparts, but they also maintain a high standard of quality,” said Michelle Harler, owner of Guide2Free. “For instance, their Red Lava Citrus and Magnolia Daylily scented candles are not only affordable but also provide a similar sensory experience to high-end alternatives.”While these may not be luxury brands, here are some options:Better Homes &amp; Gardens Red Lava Citrus 18oz Scented 2-wick Candle, $16.67Better Homes &amp; Gardens 18 oz. Magnolia &amp; Daylily Scented Wooden Wick Bell Jar Candle, $14.87Sunglasses and Accessories“Imagine walking into a Walmart and walking out with a Rolex watch that would typically retail for over $65,000. Or perhaps a Celine bag, which usually retails for over $3,000. You can even find Miu Miu sunglasses and Chanel perfume,” said Allen. “So, the next time you’re thinking of splurging on a luxury item, take a detour to Walmart. You might just find the same item at a price that makes your wallet a lot happier.”Here are a couple of online deals:Miu Miu Metal Women’s Rectangle Sunglasses Pale Gold 58mm, Adult, $110.12Celine Brown Monogram Macadam Tote Bag 16CK855W, $368PlantersWalmart’s Better Homes &amp; Gardens line also excels when it comes to other household items like planters.

JWN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 10.08, while its industry has an average P/E of 14.53. Over the last 12 months, JWN's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.04 and as low as 5.73, with a median of 7.85.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. JWN has a P/S ratio of 0.22. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.39.Finally, our model also underscores that JWN has a P/CF ratio of 3.74. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook.

The dividend yield will be 5.1% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Based on Huntington Bancshares' last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 39%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 9.9%. Despite that, analysts estimate the future payout ratio could be 48% over the same time period, which is in a pretty comfortable range.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.16 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.62. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.We Could See Huntington Bancshares' Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Huntington Bancshares has grown earnings per share at 5.4% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Huntington Bancshares' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Huntington Bancshares Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

JAKK is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27 after market close.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings and net sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38.5% and 18%, respectively.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 47 cents. In last year’s reported quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $2.10. For net sales, the consensus estimate is pegged at $154.4 million, suggesting a decline of 29.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.JAKKS Pacific, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseJAKKS Pacific, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseJAKKS Pacific, Inc. price-eps-surprise | JAKKS Pacific, Inc. QuoteLet’s analyze the factors that are likely to have made an impact this earnings season.Key Factors at PlayJAKKS Pacific’s second-quarter top line is likely to have been negatively impacted by dismal North America net sales, courtesy of lower consumer discretionary spending. Due to ongoing economic uncertainties, consumers are more selective and price conscious, which is reflected in the comparatively lower consumer discretionary spending on a year-over-year basis. On the other hand, the company is likely to have benefited from the solid performance of the international segment.For second-quarter 2023, our model predicts United States and Canada sales to decline 37.5% to $120.2 million and 4% to $5.3 million, respectively, year over year.

This saw the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 closing higher for the second consecutive week. Although the Fed is likely to go for another interest rate hike this week, optimism has gripped markets that it could likely be the last of the hikes before the Fed ends its monetary tightening cycle.Both the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) declined in June. CPI increased 3% year over year in June after rising 4% in May, its lowest level since March 2021. Month over month, CPI rose just 0.2% in June.Core CPI, which strips out the volatile energy and food prices, also rose a modest 0.2% in June, while on a year-over-year basis, it rose 4.8%, its smallest increase in nearly two years. PPI increased 0.2% in June.Food prices rose in June, but the situation is far better than the year-ago period. Inflation cooled to 4.8% in June after hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022.The Fed has increased interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022. The central bank finally left interest rates unchanged in its June meeting but said that two more interest rate hikes of 25 basis points would be needed by the end of this year.This has somewhat raised concerns about the economy slowing further. However, the impressive inflation data has now raised hopes that the Fed might end its monetary tightening policy after a 25-basis point hike in its upcoming July FOMC meeting.Slowing inflation has also seen consumer confidence making a solid jump in June. Consumer confidence climbed to 109.7 in June from May’s reading of 102.5, to hit the highest level since January 2022.Moreover, the Present Situation Index, which indicates consumers’ assessment of the present labor market and business conditions, rose to 155.3 in June from 148.9 in May.Higher interest rates can affect consumer spending patterns, raise borrowing costs and slow economic growth. These would weigh on the stock market performance.Story continuesCompanies in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to benefit from cooling inflation and a pause in interest rate hikes because consumers will likely have more discretionary income, which can be used for non-essential purchases.Our ChoicesThus, from an investment perspective, we have identified four stocks from the consumer discretionary sector that are likely to capitalize on reduced inflationary pressure. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Recently, MCHP broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.MCHP has rallied 9.5% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests MCHP could be on the verge of another move higher.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account MCHP's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 2 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.With a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on MCHP for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""The benefits far outweigh that (tax) cost,"" he saidUnder the deal in which ONEOK will also assume Magellan's debt, ONEOK will pay $25 and 0.6670 shares of ONEOK common stock for each outstanding Magellan common unit, representing a premium of 22% to Magellan's closing price on May 12.Milford said Magellan investors would also benefit from the combined company's increased scale, product diversification, and annual cost savings of up to $400 million.The vote on the deal is scheduled for Sept. 21.MLPs were designed to promote the production of commodities such as oil and natural gas and the building out of infrastructure facilities, but in recent years they have fallen out of favor with investors in part due to their exclusion from major indexes.Magellan's pipelines move refined petroleum products and crude oil, while ONEOK is focused on transporting natural gas liquids and natural gas.

The wider blue-chip CSI 300 Index snapped a six-day losing streak to pop 3% and buying from state banks propped the yuan.In sweltering Europe, the tone was more subdued as a survey of big banks by the European Central Bank - also meeting this week - showed business demand for loans dropped in the second quarter to their lowest in the 20-year history of the poll as credit conditions tightened further. German business confidence sagged again this month too.Euro/dollar slipped further after the reports.All of which painted a confusing picture of the global demand pulse going into the Fed meeting, with Monday's news of ebbing U.S. business sentiment in July at least showing overall growth in activity - in contrast to the euro zone contraction.A jump in crude oil prices to three-month highs on Monday - due to a major U.S. refinery outage and background China stimulus hopes - was twinned with a 10 basis-point spike in two-year Treasury yields on a downbeat auction to add to the messy dashboard.Both oil and Treasury yields gave back some of those gains again today, however, with year-on-year crude price declines still tracking more than 21%. S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq stock futures pushed higher, after fresh Wall St gains on Monday that saw Dow Jones bluechips clock an 11-day winning streak for the first time in more than six years. VIX volatility gauges subsided from two-week highs.Story continuesThere was little ostensible reaction to the formal rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 index that pared weightings of several of the big caps to reduce ""over-concentration"".With the earnings season in full swing, investors now focus on readouts from mega caps Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet's after the bell on Tuesday - with the bar high after this year's AI-infused stock surges and sky-high valuations.The approach of Wednesday's Fed decision may limit market moves until then. As it stands, futures are fully priced for another quarter-point rate hike to the 5.25-5.50% range - and still see this as likely the last in the cycle as markets indicate less than a 50% chance of another move later in the year.Easing expectations for 12 months time are gradually being reined in however.Events to watch for on Tuesday: * U.S. corporate earnings: Microsoft, Alphabet, Texas Instruments, NextEra Energy, Visa, Invesco, GE, GM, Dow, Danaher, Corning, Kimberly-Clark, Biogen, Verizon, Moody's, EQT, 3M, Universal Health, Chubb, Dover, Nucor, Paccar, Sherwin-Williams, Archer-Daniels-Midland etc * U.S. July consumer confidence, Richmond Fed July business survey, Philadelphia Fed July service sector, May house prices * Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee starts 2-day policy meeting - decision Wednesday * International Monetary Fund updates World Economic Outlook * U.S. Treasury auctions 5-year notes(By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

While China has imported nearly record amounts of crude so far in 2023, fuel demand in the country has struggled to reach pre-COVID levels.This trend had also largely undermined bets that a recovery in China will drive global oil demand to record highs in 2023.But more stimulus measures could still result in such a scenario, especially as the government promotes private investment and spending in the country.U.S. inventory data on tapOil markets were also focused on U.S. inventory data, which is due later on Tuesday and Wednesday. Inventories are expected to have fallen by over 2 million barrels in the week to July 21, indicating some steady demand.But indicators of U.S. fuel consumption will be closely watched, amid some concerns over sluggish demand in the world’s largest oil consumer. Extreme weather conditions and high inflation have somewhat weighed on fuel demand in recent weeks.Story continuesFed rate hike, outlook awaitedGains in oil markets were limited on Tuesday as markets awaited a Fed decision on interest rates. The central bank is widely expected to hike rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of a two-day meeting this Wednesday.While the hike appears to be largely priced in by markets, focus is squarely on whether the bank will signal more raises or an end to its nearly 16 month-long rate hike cycle.Any indications of higher rates bode poorly for the world’s largest economy, and could potentially stymie oil demand as economic activity slows.Data released this week already pointed to worsening business activity in the world’s largest economies.Related ArticlesOil prices rise as tight supply, China stimulus offsets Fed jittersVietnam aims to raise annual raw rare earths output to 2 million t/yr by 2030Gold retreats further on eve of Fed decision, copper rises]"

The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.Morgan Stanley and Citigroup declined to comment.Before joining Citi, Kagan worked on structuring deals at Goldman Sachs Group Inc for nearly a decade. He started his career as a tax associate at law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP.A number of Wall Street banks have investment banking teams that work on so-called structured deals, which include corporate restructuring transactions such as corporate carveouts and spin-outs.At Goldman Sachs, for instance, David Dubner leads its M&amp;A structuring unit, while former Goldman banker Joe Todd spearheads Evercore Inc's spin-off business.Kagan's hiring comes as more companies mull ways to shed non-core assets amid concerns about an economic slowdown. Just in 2022, there were 30 separation deals globally, representing about 17% of all the spin-off transactions that were unveiled during the last decade, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs and EY.Roughly half of such deals from the 2018-to-2022 period were worth over $5 billion, compared with a third from the 2012 to 2017 period that met that threshold, according to the Goldman-EY study.Morgan Stanley has also made other high-profile hires of late to boost its investment banking franchise.

However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that more rate hikes are expected this year. The “dot plot” of the June FOMC showed that the majority of Fed officials expected two more rate hike of 25 basis points each this year.The inflation rate stayed elevated well above the central bank’s 2% target rate despite a stiff fall from its 40-year peak in June 2022. The major concern for the Fed is a resilient U.S. labor market. Although job additions in June were lower than expectations, it was in line with the historical average. Moreover, the wage rate remained sticky downward.Market participants are expecting the Fed to hike the benchmark interest rate again in the July FOMC meeting. At present, the CME FedWatch indicates almost a 100% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25-5.5% in July. No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025.The expectation for the terminal interest rate for the ongoing rate hike cycle is currently 5.6%, instead of the 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting. Several economists and financial experts remained concerned that higher interest rate may lead to a near-term recession.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe that one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are - Unum Group UNM, NRG Energy Inc. NRG, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.

While Benioff remains in charge at Salesforce, other billionaire founder/CEOs such Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Larry Page and Netflix's Reed Hastings have all stepped away from groundbreaking companies born during the 1990s.Benioff, 58, isn't ready to leave Salesforce yet, even though he has amassed an $8 billion fortune and just went through a challenging stretch that might have caused many CEOs to head for the exit. In January, Benioff decided to lay off 8,000 Salesforce employees after overseeing a pandemic-driven expansion that included a nearly $28 billion acquisition of the popular workplace tool Slack and then grappled with an investor backlash triggered by a nearly 50% drop in the company's stock price last year. The shares have recovered most of their losses so far this year on the strength of a revived revenue growth.The Associated Press recently sat down with Benioff for an interview that has been lightly edited for clarity.Q: How does the landscape look to you as the pandemic fades into the rearview mirror?A: When I look back at 2019, we had really gone through three huge waves of technology: cloud computing, mobile and social. And now we are going into the fourth wave, which is probably the most important one in AI (artificial intelligence), which is not just the most important technology of our lifetime, but probably the most important in any lifetime. It’s going to be a new world of technology that’s as exciting as all the other worlds put together.Q: Is this on the scale of the development of nuclear bombs back in World War II?A: Technologies are never good or bad, it’s what we do with them that matters. Nobody wants a Hiroshima moment to understand how dangerous AI is. We want to be able to kind of get our heads around the tremendous consequences of the technology that we are working with. And that’s going to require a multi-stakeholder approach — companies, governments, non-governmental organizations and others to put together the guidelines for this technology.Story continuesQ: Have you been surprised or alarmed by how quickly things seem to be advancing since the release of the ChatGPT bot late last year?A: We are moving from the generative ChatGPT phase, which is phase one, into a stage where we are about to see agents that are quite alive and aware and able to take these kinds of massive actions. These are called multimodal agents, that is they can move from text to speech to video. And then we are going to move into something that is maybe more multisensory, where these agents are going to be more aware of us and we are going to be more aware of them.None of us are really ready for this because none of us have had this experience before. We are on the threshold of a dramatic change in the way we work with computers. We are going to work side by side with them. And, in many cases, they are going to augment or extend what we have been doing. They are going to be taking actions without our knowledge.Q: Salesforce is one of many tech companies that now allow employees to work remotely at least a few days a week. How has the pandemic changed the nature of work?A: We are all using technology to find more freedom in our lives. Things are back to normal, but people do go to the office less. And that is not going to change. We are never going back to they way it was.Q: The tech industry expanded rapidly during the pandemic and then abruptly reversed course with a waves of layoffs that included Salesforce. What happened?A: Companies were too optimistic, including ours. And we unfortunately had to make adjustments, some that we did not want to make. I think everyone got hypnotized during the pandemic that that was what the future was going to look like. And when the pandemic was over, there was a snapback.Q: Have you given much thought to how much longer you want to remain Salesforce's CEO?A: I think about my career every day, but I have never been more excited about the future of the industry and the potential to help all our customers. This technology revolution that is going on in artificial intelligence and the importance of bringing trust to AI is a real call to arms.]"

In our brief time together, I asked Jim why his company's stock traded on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 15 times (discount to the broader market) whereas Microsoft is north of 30 times (premium to the broader market).IBM does cool stuff, I think, and is doing more of it increasingly in high-growth areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The company's lucrative consultancy business also had a very solid second quarter.Kavanaugh acknowledged the valuation gap between the two tech icons and said it would close with a steady stream of consistent execution.Perhaps that will happen.But the exchange left an impression on me: While IBM fights to command a more premium valuation in a hot tech market, Microsoft's valuation will keep expanding. So why not continue to ride the Microsoft juggernaut as an investor?Microsoft has winning momentum that is supporting higher profit estimates, higher valuation estimates, and higher cash flow estimates.The first place to look for Microsoft's momentum is, naturally, AI.Microsoft's reveal of its AI subscription pricing last week sent the stock to a new high — and with good reason, Jefferies veteran tech analyst Brent Thill explained.""AI is already benefiting Azure results and this should only be the beginning given Microsoft's pole position in a decade-long industry evolution. Microsoft announced M365 copilot pricing of $30 per user/month, which reflects a 53-83% pricing uplift, far greater than the 15-30% previously thought,"" said Thill. ""If just half of our conservative estimate of ~115 million E3 &amp; E5 users adopt M365 copilot, M365 copilot could drive $20.6 billion in incremental revenue representing ~53% growth from FY23 O365 commercial revenue or ~10% upside to FY23 total revenue. Hence, we believe that M365 copilot could help double O365 commercial revenue in the next 4-5 years.""Story continuesThose are huge potential financial statement drivers. Actually, they helped Microsoft set the stage for a major reset upwards of Street expectations, not unlike what Nvidia did a few months ago.So there is all of that.While Microsoft drives towards its AI future, the near term appears quite nice as well.The company's cloud business Azure continues to hum as the economy enters a ""steady state"" period, as characterized to me in a chat with American Express CEO Stephen Squeri.""Our recent CIO Survey showed stable, but muted, IT budget growth expectations for CY23. However, several forward looking indicators in the CIO survey support Microsoft's strong relative positioning within those muted CY23 budgets growth expectations, including Microsoft being the only software vendor in our survey for which forward growth expectations actually improved sequentially in our survey,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss pointed out.Notice I haven't even dived into the possible material profit lift from the addition of Activision Blizzard. I am running out of room on this page but will simply say this gaming deal will be another big tailwind to Microsoft.What can go wrong with this bull's dream story? Perhaps the economy falls off a cliff and Satya Nadella steps down as CEO in 2024.But I don't see either happening.And that means more winning for MicrosoftEarnings are out July 25.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

While the median asking rent in the 50 largest metros increased to $1,745, up by $7 from last month, it was down $31 from its July 2022 peak.""The downward trend in rent prices continued in June, providing a much-needed respite for renters and an opportunity to regain some control over their housing expenses,"" said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""With our midyear forecast update calling for slowing inflation, better-than-expected labor market performance, and an increase in multi-family supply, we're seeing some encouraging signs for renters' budgets as we enter the second half of the year.""June marks the first year-over-year decrease in rent for one-bedroom units since 2020, mirroring the first such drop in rent for two-bedroom units in May.While continuing rent price declines are helping to improve affordability, it's important to note that rents remain significantly elevated: 24.1% higher than the same time in 2019. Rents for studios, for example, also continue to grow. The median rent of studios was $1,445, up by $14 (1.0%) year-over-year and $229 (18.8%) higher than four years ago.June 2023 Rental Metrics by Unit Size – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentRent YoYRent Change – June 2019Overall$1,745-1.0 %+24.1 %Studio$1,445+1.0 %+18.8 %1-bed$1,630-0.7 %+24.5 %2-bed$1,945-1.0 %+27.0 %Western rents drop further as San Jose experiences first declineRent in Western metros continues to decline faster than other parts of the country (-3.8% Y/Y). San Jose, the last large western metro to show a decline in rental prices, saw its first year-over-year rent drop in nearly two years (-1.4%). In contrast, rents in northeastern hubs such as New York City (+4.7%) and Boston (+2.5%) continued to climb more quickly. The strong labor market in the Northeast is likely driving demand, although increasing supply may help ease the upward pressure on rent prices. Rents in the Midwest are still climbing (+3.2%), due to greater affordability in the region. Of the Top 10 metros experiencing the most rent growth, half are located in the Midwest. Meanwhile, rents in the South (-1.3%) dropped lower than a year ago.Story continuesYoungest metros offer affordability, tech jobsAffordable rent and job prospects are key factors for young people choosing a place to live. Of the 10 metros with the highest share of young households and young renters (aged 25-34), Oklahoma City ranks as the most affordable, with younger individuals spending only 18.7% of their monthly income on the typical rental during June. This age group, which makes up 30% of employees in the tech sector, according to our estimation from the Current Population Survey, is renting in areas with high tech growth, suggesting that tech jobs hold considerable appeal for young households.

Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). We use rental sources that reliably report data each month within the top 50 largest metropolitan areas. Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.With the release of its June rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since June 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including releases about historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.We define young households and young renters as those aged between 25-34 years old. We exclude renters aged below 25 years old to minimize the impact of college renters. To calculate the share of annual income spent on rents for households aged between 25-34, we used the annual median household income data sourced from Claritas.We leverage Brookings' definition and define the technology sector as six industries from 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS): Computer and Equipment Manufacturing (3341), Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing (3344), Software Publishers (5112), Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services (5182), Other Information Services (5191), and Computer System Design and Related Services (5415). With this definition, we calculated the share of tech labor by age using the 2022 Current Population Survey. The compound annual growth rate for the tech sector is calculated based on the number of employees in the technology industry sourced from 2019 and 2021 County Business Patterns data.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

The bounce back of the equity markets and other sectors has reinvigorated sentiments in the segment.

This compares to earnings of $0.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -31.37%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric and gas utility would post earnings of $1.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of -1.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.NorthWestern , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $290.5 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.03%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $323 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.NorthWestern shares have lost about 3.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.2%.What's Next for NorthWestern?While NorthWestern has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for NorthWestern: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.70 on $360.62 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.43 on $1.59 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Xcel Energy (XEL), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on July 27.This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.3%.

""All that volatility and all that uncertainty increases the value of our investments.""But rising raw commodity costs and tight crop supplies have squeezed margins for the grains traders.ADM posted lower year-over-year results in its three largest business segments.Reduced crushing margins and historically weak U.S. crop exports weighed on results from ADM's Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, its largest by revenue and volume.ADM's Carbohydrate Solutions unit capitalized on strong demand for sweeteners and starches, though results were dented by weaker ethanol margins.Results in the company's high-margin Nutrition segment struggled in what ADM called a ""challenging demand environment.""ADM posted an adjusted profit of $1.89 per share for the three months ended June 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.60 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Adjusted EPS, which excludes these items, was $1.89.1Story continues1Non-GAAP financial measures; see pages 5, 10, 11 and 12 for explanations and reconciliations, including after-tax amounts.Quarterly Results of OperationsAg Services &amp; Oilseeds results were strong, but slightly lower than the second quarter of 2022.Ag Services results were in-line with the strong second quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year, as the team delivered record volumes and higher margins on strong export demand, leveraging our strategic investments in port capacity to capitalize on the record Brazilian soybean crop. Results for North America origination were slightly lower year-over-year, driven by lower export volumes due to large South America supplies. Our execution in Destination Marketing as well as effective risk management continued to deliver strong Global Trade results, though lower than last year’s record quarter.Crushing results were much lower than the record result from the second quarter last year. Global soy crush margins remained strong, but were lower year-over-year in all regions due to softer demand for both meal and oil and a tight US soybean carryout. This was partially offset by strong softseed margins and higher volumes, supported by a strong Canadian canola crop and use of our flex capacity in EMEA. Additionally, there were approximately $195 million of negative mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods.Refined Products and Other results were significantly higher than the prior-year period, achieving a record second quarter. North America results were higher, driven by strong food oil demand and improved biodiesel volumes. In EMEA, strong export demand for biodiesel and domestic food oil demand supported stronger margins. Additionally, there were approximately $90 million of positive mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods.Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the second quarter of 2022.Carbohydrate Solutions delivered strong results in Q2, but lower than the record second quarter of last year.The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, capitalized on a solid demand environment during the quarter. North America starches and sweeteners delivered volumes and margins similar to the prior year, and ethanol margins were solid as industry stocks moderated, though lower relative to the prior year. Q2 results were negatively impacted due to unplanned downtime at one of our corn germ plants. In EMEA, the team effectively managed margins to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted higher margins, supported by steady customer demand.Vantage Corn Processors results were lower due to lower year-over-year ethanol margins. The prior year period also included a one-time $50 million benefit from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program.Nutrition results were significantly lower year-over-year versus the record prior-year quarter.Human Nutrition results were in-line with the second quarter of 2022, as the team effectively managed a challenging demand environment. Flavors results were significantly higher than the prior year due to improved mix and pricing in EMEA and improving demand in North America. Specialty Ingredients results were lower year-over-year due to softer demand for plant-based proteins, particularly in the meat alternatives category in North America and Europe, partially offset by strong performance in texturants. Health &amp; Wellness results were similar versus the prior year as lower demand for fibers offset lower SG&amp;A costs.Animal Nutrition results were much lower compared to the same quarter last year due to significantly lower contribution from amino acids, pockets of softer global feed demand affecting volumes, and continued demand fulfillment challenges and inventory losses in Pet Solutions.Other Business results were significantly higher than the prior-year quarter due to improved ADM Investor Services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance results improved on premiums from new programs partially offset by increased claim settlements.Other Items of NoteAs additional information to help clarify underlying business performance, the table on page 10 includes reported earnings and EPS as well as adjusted earnings and EPS.Segment operating profit of $1.5 billion for the quarter includes charges of $114 million ($0.16 per share) related to impairments, restructuring, and a contingent loss provision related to import duties, and gains of $11 million ($0.02 per share) related to the sale of certain assets.In Corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs were similar versus the prior year as lower health insurance costs were offset by increased global technology spend. Other Corporate was unfavorable versus the prior year primarily due to foreign currency hedges.Note: Additional Facts and ExplanationsAdditional facts and explanations about results and industry environment can be found at the end of the ADM Q2 Earnings Presentation at www.adm.com/webcast.Conference Call InformationADM will host a webcast on July 25, 2023, at 8 a.m. Central Time to discuss financial results and provide a company update.

Adjusted segment operating profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, is segment operating profit excluding specified items. Management believes that segment operating profit and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of ADM’s performance because they provide investors information about ADM’s business unit performance excluding corporate overhead costs as well as specified items. Segment operating profit and adjusted segment operating profit are not measures of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to income before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.Consolidated Statements of Earnings(unaudited)Quarter endedSix months endedJune 30June 302023202220232022(in millions, except per share amounts)Revenues$25,190$27,284$49,262$50,934Cost of products sold (1)23,30725,18445,29946,937Gross profit1,8832,1003,9633,997Selling, general, and administrative expenses (2)8418141,7221,643Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs (3)601672Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates(151)(192)(325)(396)Interest and investment income(142)(32)(276)(91)Interest expense (4)18073327165Other (income) expense - net (5)(37)(83)(81)(116)Earnings before income taxes1,1321,5192,5292,790Income tax expense (benefit) (6)204279429486Net earnings including noncontrolling interests9281,2402,1002,304Less: Net earnings (losses) attributable to noncontrolling interests14314Net earnings attributable to ADM$927$1,236$2,097$2,290Diluted earnings per common share$1.70$2.18$3.82$4.03Average diluted shares outstanding546568549568(1) Includes a net reversal of charges related to inventory writedowns of $5 million and a contingency loss provision of $62 million related to import duties in the current quarter and YTD.

Adjusted EPS reflects ADM’s fully diluted EPS after removal of the effect on EPS as reported of specified items as more fully described above. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted EPS are useful measures of ADM’s performance because they provide investors additional information about ADM’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace or be alternatives to net earnings and EPS as reported, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, or any other measures of operating results under GAAP.

Adjusted ROIC earnings is ADM’s net earnings adjusted for the after-tax effects of interest expense on borrowings, and specified items. Adjusted invested capital is the sum of ADM’s equity (excluding noncontrolling interests) and interest-bearing liabilities adjusted for the after-tax effect of specified items. Management believes Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure because it provides investors information about ADM’s returns excluding the impacts of specified items and increases period-to-period comparability of underlying business performance. Management uses Adjusted ROIC to measure ADM’s performance by comparing Adjusted ROIC to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Adjusted ROIC, Adjusted ROIC earnings and Adjusted invested capital are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace or be alternatives to GAAP financial measures.Adjusted Earnings Before Taxes, Interest, and Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)A non-GAAP financial measure(unaudited)The tables below provide a reconciliation of earnings before income taxes to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment for the trailing four quarters ended June 30, 2023.Four QuartersQuarter EndedEndedSep. 30, 2022Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2023Jun. 30, 2023Jun. 30, 2023(in millions)Earnings before income taxes$1,230$1,213$1,397$1,132$4,972Interest expense97134100124455Depreciation and amortization2602542592621,035Losses (gains) on sales of assets and businesses(29)(17)(1)(11)(58)Impairment and restructuring charges and contingency provisions49747117247Railroad maintenance expense3226—260Expenses related to acquisitions———33Adjusted EBITDA$1,639$1,684$1,762$1,629$6,714Four QuartersQuarter EndedEndedSep. 30, 2022Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2023Jun. 30, 2023Jun. 30, 2023(in millions)Ag Services and Oilseeds$1,166$1,271$1,300$1,143$4,880Carbohydrate Solutions3913383523811,462Nutrition242196210253901Other Business351249784340Corporate(195)(245)(197)(232)(869)Adjusted EBITDA$1,639$1,684$1,762$1,629$6,714Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest on borrowings, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the hedge fund manager’s portfolio, head directly to Tom Russo's Top 5 Holdings. Thomas A. Russo has been a partner at Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner, now Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn, since 1989 and became the managing member in 2014. Russo's stock selection approach considers value and price together, seeking companies with strong cash-flow characteristics and robust balance sheets. His investment philosophy centers on a few industries known for generating sustainable net free cash flow, such as food, beverage, tobacco, and advertising-supported media. He aims for an absolute return of 10% to 20% per year with minimal turnover. In its latest 13F filing for the first quarter of 2023, Russo’s hedge fund disclosed $9.6 billion in managed securities, with the top 10 holdings making up 80.64% of the portfolio. During a May 2023 interview with Markets Insider, Russo expressed deep concern over the US government's aggressive borrowing and the potential long-term impact on Americans. In January 2023, the US government surpassed its borrowing limit of $31.4 trillion, and if an agreement isn't reached to raise the debt ceiling, it could face a cash shortage by June. However, even if the deadlock is resolved, there will still be a significant amount of debt that future generations will have to deal with, according to Russo. The current banking turmoil is driven, in part, by rate hikes which are negatively affecting bond prices. This situation has elicited fears that nervous lenders might pull back, leading to a credit crunch. Nevertheless, Tom Russo argued that concerns about the economy collapsing and lending drying up might be exaggerated. He pointed out that there is an abundance of cash in the system, which has kept stock prices relatively high despite the prevailing headwinds. Additionally, there are asset-price bubbles in various industries that remain a cause for caution.Story continuesAs of the first quarter of 2023, Tom Russo's largest holding is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), where he owns 2,579 shares valued at $1.20 billion. At the end of February 2023, Tom Russo joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio, and the significance of compounding. In 1982, Russo was introduced to Warren Buffett, and at that time, Berkshire Hathaway shares were priced at around $5.00 to $7.00 per share. Since then, the compound return on the investment has been an impressive 19.5%, making it a rewarding wait, as per Russo. He noted that a key principle at Berkshire is to send money to Omaha, where Warren Buffett and other skilled investors can direct its use. Berkshire's subsidiary businesses excel in their respective fields, but they don't always need constant reinvestment. By centralizing the capital in Omaha, the experienced investors can decide how to deploy it best. This approach ensures a steady and strong pace of growth and prevents operating managers from making potential investment mistakes outside their core businesses. In a recent interview, Russo outlined that Warren Buffett's investment of over $11 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) over the past 15 months may be a strategic hedge against rising energy costs. With Berkshire Hathaway holding almost a 24% stake in Occidental, the increase in oil prices would lead to higher profits for Occidental, which could help offset rising fuel costs at Buffett's other major businesses like Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF Railway. Russo commended this approach, calling it a clever and unconventional investment, similar to Buffett's previous strategy of utilizing ""float"" from his insurance companies.Don't Miss: Viking Global's Performance, AUM, and Long-Term StocksSimilarly, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), where Russo owns a $899 million stake, announced on July 18 that it has partnered with payments processing company Geidea, which will utilize Mastercard's latest technology to implement BIN ranges, allowing consumers, merchants, and fintechs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to access advanced payment solutions. Starting from July 21, visitors and tourists also have the option to connect their Mastercard accounts with China's renowned mobile payment platforms. This integration enables them to conveniently book taxis, use the subway, and make purchases at numerous outlets across the cashless nation. This development represents a renewed initiative by Alipay and WeChat Pay to accommodate foreign credit cards, following their earlier limited access attempts in late 2019.Investors who seek guidance from popular Wall Street hedge fund managers can check out some of the best stocks in Tom Russo’s portfolio as of Q1 2023, which include Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Delivering performance through fundamental, bottom-up stock selection has been a constant over our tenure managing the Strategy. We underperformed in the first half of 2022 from being too early in entering several stocks going through negative earnings revisions and have seen relative results rebound over the last 12 months due to better stock picking, especially among earnings reset names such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn’s Stake Value: $506,886,095Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is involved in businesses such as insurance, freight rail transportation, and utilities worldwide. It is one of Tom Russo’s top stock picks. In the first quarter of 2023, Russo’s hedge fund owned 1.64 million shares worth $506.8 million, representing 5.25% of the total holdings. On July 10, Berkshire Hathaway Energy reached an agreement to purchase Dominion Energy's 50% ownership in the Cove Point LNG plant in Maryland for a total of $3.3 billion.

(NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 20 million shares worth $6 billion. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Berkshire Hathaway is our oldest position. We have held it for almost 11 years, and it has been our largest position for most of that time. We have told you so much about Berkshire through the years that it is difficult not to repeat ourselves.BRK is our core investment, and I would describe our view on the company this way: If I had to invest all my money in a single stock and could not touch it at all for 5–10 years, then I would choose BRK without any hesitation. It is a conglomerate consisting of individual investments the quality of which is well above average, with efficiency in capital allocation that is far above average, having an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, and with very low business risk.All this comes at a valuation that is significantly below the market average. BRK’s earnings power, the determination of which requires a thorough understanding of its business and a good bit of manual labor, is somewhere just north of USD 50 billion a year. Therefore, the entire company, with its market capitalisation of USD 590 billion, trades at less than 12 times annual earnings. It is very realistic to expect BRK’s stock price to grow at an average rate of about 10% per year over the long term…” (Click here to see the full text)8. Philip Morris International Inc.

Should the deal be finalized, it is anticipated to catapult Syqe Medical into one of the world’s largest marijuana companies, cementing its position in the global cannabis industry.The move by Philip Morris to invest in the cannabis sector does not come as a surprise, as the company has been hinting at its interest in marijuana-related business opportunities for several years. This strategic move is in line with an increasing trend among large tobacco companies exploring opportunities within the cannabis space.In 2018, Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO), another major player in the tobacco industry, made significant strides into the cannabis market with a whopping $1.8 billion investment in the Canadian company Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CRON). Similarly, in 2019 British tobacco company Imperial Brands PLC (OTC: IMBBY) also joined the race by investing $93.4 million in the Canadian cannabis firm, Auxly Cannabis Group Inc. (OTC: CBWTF).Philip Morris’ substantial investment in Syqe Medical has the potential to bring about significant changes in the cannabis industry. If the acquisition is successful, Syqe will gain access to extensive financial resources and global distribution networks, enabling it to expand its product reach to new markets. Moreover, this move could signal increased interest from other major tobacco companies to explore opportunities in the cannabis sector, leading to further investments and partnerships in the marijuana space.Top Psychedelic Companies for Week#1: AwaknAwakn Life Sciences Corp.

(OTC: FLHLF) and special purpose acquisition company Jupiter Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: JAQC) recently announced a definitive agreement to merge. The merger will result in the creation of a new public company that is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange.The deal, which was announced on Wednesday, July 19, 2023, values Filament at $176 million or $0.85 per share, and it brings the pro forma enterprise valuation of the combined entity to approximately $210 million. The deal is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of this year and is expected to provide the combined company with at least $5 million of net proceeds.This strategic merger is set to propel Filament’s botanical psychedelic drug development platform to new heights. Benjamin Lightburn, CEO of Filament, expressed his enthusiasm about the partnership, emphasizing that it will give the company access to the broader capital markets necessary to advance their drug development initiatives. Lightburn stated, “Filament was founded on the belief that standardized, naturally-derived psychedelic medicines can improve the lives of millions of people suffering from treatable conditions. Partnering with Jupiter brings us a step closer to making this a reality.”Jupiter CEO James Hauslein also echoed the excitement, praising Filament’s “novel” approach to psychedelic drug development, which involves utilizing natural botanical extracts. The collaboration between the two companies aims to leverage their respective expertise and resources to accelerate the development of effective psychedelic treatments for various medical conditions.The proposed merger has received approval from both companies’ boards, with Filament’s board receiving a fair opinion from independent financial advisor Evans &amp; Evans, Inc. However, the transaction is still subject to regulatory approval, court orders from the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and the consent of Filament’s security holders and Jupiter’s stockholders. To increase the likelihood of approval, directors and management of Filament, who collectively own approximately 42.8% of outstanding common shares, have committed to voting in favor of the merger.#3: Numinus WellnessNuminus Wellness Inc. (OTC: NUMIF), a mental health care company specializing in evidence-based psychedelic-assisted therapies, recently announced impressive financial results for the third quarter ending on May 31, 2023. The company’s revenue surged by a remarkable 713.3% year-over-year, reaching $6 million, and showed a substantial growth of 12.6% from the previous quarter.According to the company, a significant factor contributing to this success was the gross profit, which saw an extraordinary increase of 1051.6% from the same quarter last year, amounting to $2.1 million. However, it’s essential to note that during the quarter, Numinus incurred $600,000 in one-time expenses due to staff reductions and operational realignment. As a result, the company reported a net loss of $7.2 million for the quarter.Despite the net loss, Numinus remains financially well-positioned, boasting $13 million in cash reserves as of May 31, 2023.

(NASDAQ:ROP) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Roper Technologies The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.16bUS$2.63bUS$3.08bUS$3.40bUS$3.68bUS$3.91bUS$4.11bUS$4.28bUS$4.43bUS$4.57bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 10.65%Est @ 8.09%Est @ 6.29%Est @ 5.04%Est @ 4.16%Est @ 3.54%Est @ 3.11% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.1%) = US$74bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$74b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$33bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$56b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$499, the company appears about fair value at a 5.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Roper Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.055. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Roper TechnologiesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The focal point of the leading global money transfer company’s earnings release will be its Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) operations. Lower year-over-year transactions during the quarter under discussion are likely to impact results.Click here to find out how the company’s overall second-quarter performance is expected to have been.C2C BusinessThe Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment offers money transfer services between two consumers, primarily through an interconnected global network. This segment includes money transfer transactions that can be initiated through websites and mobile devices. A substantial majority of the transfer in this segment is cross-border. It also provides intra-country transfer services for some nations.C2C's Q1 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, the company’s C2C segment reported revenues of $938.3 million, which tumbled 6% year over year on a reported basis (5% on a constant-currency basis). Branded Digital revenues, which represented 22% of C2C’s revenues, decreased 7% on a reported basis (6% on a constant-currency basis). Operating income plunged 14% to $177.8 million, while the margin of 18.9% fell from 20.7% a year ago.Affected by the suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus, its transactions within the segment fell 6% year over year. Lower transactions across the Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, North America and Asia Pacific region were partially offset by solid performance in the Latin American and Caribbean regions and the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.Forecast for Q2 PerformanceReduced transactions across the Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as in North America, are likely to have affected transaction volumes in the second quarter. Transactions figure in the segment is expected to have declined almost 7% in the quarter under review to 63.5 million.Story continuesNevertheless, its Branded Digital go-to-market strategy is likely to have garnered improved transaction volumes in the to-be-reported quarter. Yet, promotional pricing in Branded Digital strategy is likely to affect revenues. It is also likely to include a negative impact from foreign exchange translations.Our estimate for second-quarter C2C segment’s revenues is pegged at over $950 million, indicating 7.4% year-over-year decline. Also, our model suggests that revenue per transaction is likely to decline in the quarter under discussion, affecting the overall top line.The negatives are likely to have been partially offset by improved volumes in Latin America, Middle East and South Asia. We also expect Cross-border Principal to have improved in the second quarter due to monetary policy changes in Iraq.Higher information technology related investments and lower revenues are likely to have affected operating income from the C2C segment. Our estimate for C2C operating income is pegged at $158.4 million, indicating a significant decline from $225.6 million a year ago. However, lower agent commissions and other expenses are expected to have provided some support.Overall Projections for Q2The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion, suggesting an 8.1% year-over-year decline. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at 38 cents, which suggests a 25.5% decrease from the year-ago tally of 51 cents.Western Union beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, delivering an average surprise of 12.2%.The Western Union Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company price-eps-surprise | The Western Union Company QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Western Union this time around.

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. To wit, the Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) share price has flown 185% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! And in the last month, the share price has gained 20%. This could be related to the recent financial results that were recently released - you could check the most recent data by reading our company report.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Schlumberger moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Schlumberger has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Schlumberger the TSR over the last 3 years was 201%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Schlumberger shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 0.7% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Schlumberger better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Schlumberger   you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(Photo: David Curetean/Shutterstock)FreightWaves has written extensively in recent months about how historically weak U.S. box demand has been, and nothing’s changed of late. In fact, demand continues to surprise to the downside, even though it’s been consistently worse than the largest North American containerboard and box producers expected in each of the past three quarters. Why does this matter? Box demand is a reliable leading economic indicator, specifically for the goods economy; both the goods economy (as reflected in truck and rail volumes) and box demand have been profoundly weak for over a year, with no indication of improvement ahead.After market close on Monday, the third-largest North American containerboard and box producer, Packaging Corp. of America, reported its Q2 results; these included a 9.8% box shipment decline, one of its most severe on record. Just three months ago, the company expressed optimism that demand was improving, saying on its Q1 call that “there’s been a big turnaround starting in April … still down 6% compared to April 2022 [through the first 13 days of the month], but April 2022 was our all-time record.” So much for the big improvement: The company’s rate of shipment declines got much worse thereafter.Packaging Corp. said it expects per-day box shipments to improve sequentially in Q3, with no reason given as to why. With regional banks cutting back on lending out of necessity, the emergency government food stamp (SNAP) benefits a thing of the past, federal student loan payments set to resume in October and the Federal Reserve continuing to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, we’re unsure what would lead to improved box demand. Even if it’s better sequentially (and we don’t know why it would be), the improvement would be off of an unusually low bar: We estimate U.S. box demand is tracking roughly in line with 2017 levels, implying no growth in six years.The post US box shipments remain historically weak in Q2 appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Second quarter net sales were $2.0 billion in 2023 and $2.2 billion in 2022.Diluted earnings per share attributable to Packaging Corporation of America shareholdersThree Months EndedJune 3020232022ChangeReported Diluted EPS$2.24$3.20$(0.96)Special Items Expense (1)0.070.020.05Diluted EPS excluding Special items (2)$2.31$3.23$(0.92)(1) For descriptions and amounts of our special items, see the schedules with this release.(2) Amounts may not foot due to rounding.Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2023 include special items for certain costs at the Jackson, AL mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities and closure costs related to corrugated products facilities and design centers.Excluding special items, the ($.92) per share decrease in second quarter 2023 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower volumes in the Packaging ($.90) and Paper ($.07) segments, lower price and mix in the Packaging segment ($.47), higher depreciation expense ($.09), and higher other converting costs ($.03). These items were partially offset by lower operating costs $.34, higher prices and mix in the Paper segment $.12, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases in the second half of 2022 $.13, lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses $.03, and a lower tax rate $.02.Results were $.35 above second quarter guidance of $1.96 per share primarily due to lower operating costs resulting from efficiency and usage initiatives and lower freight and logistics expenses.Financial information by segment is summarized below and in the schedules with this release.(dollars in millions)Three Months EndedJune 3020232022Segment income (loss)Packaging$285.8$419.8Paper29.122.7Corporate and Other(30.5)(26.7)$284.4$415.8Segment income (loss) excluding special itemsPackaging$289.7$419.3Paper33.526.2Corporate and Other(30.5)(26.7)$292.7$418.8EBITDA excluding special itemsPackaging$405.3$525.3Paper38.831.5Corporate and Other(26.6)(24.2)$417.5$532.6In the Packaging segment, total corrugated products shipments and shipments per day were down (9.8%) compared to last year’s second quarter. Shipments per day were up 2.7% versus the first quarter of 2023. Containerboard production was 1,112,000 tons, and containerboard inventory was down (11,000) tons versus the first quarter of 2023 and down (49,000) tons compared to the second quarter of 2022. In the Paper segment, sales volume was down (5,000) tons compared to the first quarter of 2023 and down (19,000) tons versus the second quarter of 2022.Story continuesCommenting on reported results, Mark W. Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO, said, ""Actual results versus our guidance for the quarter reflect the outstanding efforts by employees across the Company to manage our operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner as we continued to operate both our Packaging and Paper segments against a challenging demand environment. Results also reflect energy and virgin fiber prices being lower than anticipated, and our logistics and distribution personnel did a great job minimizing the effect of higher freight rates in certain regions as well as optimizing freight routes and transportation modes. During the second quarter, we temporarily idled our Wallula, WA mill as we continued to operate the Packaging segment based on our outlook for demand.""""Looking ahead as we move from the second and into the third quarter,"" Mr. Kowlzan added, ""in our Packaging segment, although there is one less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect shipments per day to improve versus the second quarter. However, prices will be lower as a result of the previously published domestic containerboard price decreases along with slightly lower export prices. We expect seasonally stronger volume in our Paper segment from back-to-school shipments, although prices are expected to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices. Operating and converting costs should trend slightly higher primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices and seasonal energy cost. Scheduled outage expenses will be higher by approximately ($.06) per share driven by the scheduled maintenance planned at our International Falls, MN mill. Finally, we estimate our depreciation expense and tax rate to be slightly higher as well. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $1.88 per share.""We present various non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including diluted EPS excluding special items, segment income excluding special items and EBITDA excluding special items. We provide information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP in the schedules to this press release. We present our earnings expectation for the upcoming quarter excluding special items as special items are difficult to predict and quantify and may reflect the effect of future events. We currently anticipate special items in the third quarter of 2023 to include accounting charges, fees, and expenses for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities at the Jackson, AL mill. We do not currently expect any additional significant special items during the third quarter; however, additional special items may arise due to third quarter events.PCA is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. PCA operates eight mills and 86 corrugated products plants and related facilities.Some of the statements in this press release are forward-looking statements.

HOLX and Penumbra PEN.Industry: Medical InstrumentsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2125940/3-medical-instruments-stocks-to-buy-amid-improving-industry-trendsThe Medical Instruments industry is gradually coming out of the two-and-a-half-year long healthcare crisis-oriented development approach. The key focus of medical device R&amp;D is again transforming from COVID-related PPE, testing and distant care options to point-of-care testing, heavy as well as minimally invasive implants, elective procedures, so on and so forth. Meanwhile, AI and robotics for medical Internet of Things (IoT), which rose to the limelight during the pandemic phase, continue to be popular.Observation says that digital enhancement, while optimizing costs, proves to be better for clinical outcomes. However, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, has put the industry in a tight spot again. Further, the industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards are denting growth. Meanwhile, industry players like Alcon, Hologic, Inc. and Penumbra have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their stock prices.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is highly fragmented, with participants engaged in research and development (R&amp;D) in therapeutic areas. This FDA-regulated industry comprises an endless number of products, starting from transcatheter valves to orthopedic products to imaging equipment and robotics. Prior to the pandemic, the Medical Instruments space was advancing well in terms of R&amp;D.Among the recent path-breaking inventions, bone growth stimulators, 3D mapping of CT scans, wireless brain sensors and human-brain pacemakers are worth mentioning. During the COVID-hit years, many non-COVID and non-emergency-line innovations were stuck or delayed. However, with the severity of the pandemic easing, the industry players are again more focused on strengthening their pipeline.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Instruments IndustryM&amp;A Trend Continues: The medical instruments space has been benefiting from the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) trend. In fact, various reports suggest that M&amp;A has been the key catalyst in the U.S. MedTech space of late. It is a known fact that smaller and mid-sized industry players attempt to compete with the big shots through consolidation.The big players attempt to enter new markets through a niche product. In 2022, the MedTech space faced a slowdown in terms of M&amp;A compared to the previous years. It only had 11 mega deals. However, market watchers expect the M&amp;A scenario to rebound in 2023 despite the volatile economic situation. Among the significant deals of recent times, in April 2023, Abbott acquired Cardiovascular Systems at a total expected equity value of approximately $890 million.In February, Globus Medical made a $3.1 billion deal to acquire spine technology company, NuVasive. Medtronic is also divesting and restructuring its divisions for future acquisitions. In May, the company announced the acquisition of insulin patch pump maker EOFlow. Meanwhile, General Electric Company announced the completion of the spinoff of its healthcare business to create a new player in the field of precision care,  GE HealthCare.Business Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macroeconomic situation, the IMF came up with its April 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. Per the baseline forecast, growth is expected to decelerate from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023 before settling at 3% in 2024. IMF expects developed economies to see an especially pronounced slowdown in growth, from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023. IMF specifically noted that the global headline inflation in the baseline is going to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% in 2023 due to lower commodity prices.However, underlying (core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflation’s return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most cases. On a brighter note, strengthening household balance sheets and wage growth are driving private demand. Overall, Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in their revenues due to logistical challenges and increasing unit cost. This might get offset by an increase in essential and non-essential product demand by private households.Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. A June 2019 Health Care News report suggested that this market, valued at $123 billion in 2018, has been witnessing a CAGR of 25%. Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Improving ProspectsThe Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

112,be72ff3d-4a9f-33a7-99a1-082d41e9384e,HOLX,2023-07-25,Analysts Estimate Hologic (HOLX) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-hologic-holx-report-140036361.html,1690207236,STORY,['HOLX'],"[The market expects Hologic (HOLX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.4%.Revenues are expected to be $956.48 million, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hologic?For Hologic, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hologic will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hologic would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of +20.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hologic doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, Integer (ITGR) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.99 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -4.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $367.05 million, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Integer has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.52%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Integer will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, General Electric Company announced the completion of the spinoff of its healthcare business to create a new player in the field of precision care,  GE HealthCare.Business Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macroeconomic situation, the IMF came up with its April 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. Per the baseline forecast, growth is expected to decelerate from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023 before settling at 3% in 2024. IMF expects developed economies to see an especially pronounced slowdown in growth, from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023. IMF specifically noted that the global headline inflation in the baseline is going to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% in 2023 due to lower commodity prices. However, underlying (core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflation’s return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most cases. On a brighter note, strengthening household balance sheets and wage growth are driving private demand. Overall, Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in their revenues due to logistical challenges and increasing unit cost. This might get offset by an increase in essential and non-essential product demand by private households.Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. A June 2019 Health Care News report suggested that this market, valued at $123 billion in 2018, has been witnessing a CAGR of 25%. Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Improving ProspectsThe Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

HOLX Breast Health segment is likely to have witnessed strong performance owing to improved semiconductor chip availability and strong backlog. The growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base are likely to have boosted the company’s growth.We anticipate HOLX’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, scheduled for release on July 31 after the closing bell, to reflect these aspects.Click here to know how the company’s overall fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to be.Breast HealthIn the past few quarters, semiconductor chip availability continues to improve, facilitating the delivery of more gantries than planned. Also, the exceptional demand for the clinically differentiated mammography instruments remains high. Despite the duration of the chip headwind, Hologic’s backlog remains strong. We believe these trends to have continued in the fiscal third quarter as well.In the second quarter, Hologic registered strong service revenue service being the largest source of revenue for the division as it consistently demonstrates its value proposition and strengthen the relationships with customers. The interventional side of the Breast Health business returned to form, up 13.9% for the quarter. The upside was driven by the disposable portfolio such as Brevera biopsy needles and Somatex Tumark markers. We believe these trends to have continued in the fiscal third quarter as well.DiagnosticsIn third-quarter fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. The company’s expanded global installed base of more than 3,250 Panthers represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of Panther combined with a broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for customers and differentiates it from competitors. We believe these growth catalysts to have driven the company’s performance in fiscal third quarter.Story continuesHologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote In May 2023, Hologic received the FDA 510(k) clearance for the company’s Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. This assay is a molecular diagnostic test that detects and differentiates four of the most prevalent respiratory viruses that can exhibit similar clinical symptoms — severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus. We believe this development to have contributed to the company’s fiscal third-quarter performance.However, similar to industry-wide trends, Hologic’s Diagnostics business is expected to decline globally compared with the prior year’s levels due to significantly lower COVID testing.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Hologic this time around.

The Nasdaq Composite remains in view of its 52-week high hit on July 19.To be sure, market strategist bears such as Kolanovic and Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson have a host of fresh stats to support their downtrodden views.First is a mixed start to earnings season, at best.For every strong performer in the mold of a PepsiCo (PEP) and General Motors (GM) (earnings beats, guidance lifts, and solid earnings calls), there have been equal doses of Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) — disappointing overall reports that sent share prices sharply lower.And overall, the earnings season numbers don't look that grand.Among the 20% or so of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported second quarter earnings, sales are on pace for a lackluster 0.2% year-on-year drop. Earnings are tracking lower by 9.3%, according to Evercore ISI data.The average stock price has dropped 1% post the companies' earnings reports.Story continuesMeantime, fresh signs are emerging that overseas economies are far from healthy, another potential reason to doubt the justification of robust stock valuations.Consider this: The latest composite French Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) — a measure of economic activity — hit a 32-month low. Germany's composite PMI just reached an eight-month low. Overall, Eurozone PMIs are at eight-month lows.Bronze sculptures depicting a bull and bear stand in front of the stock market in Frankfurt, Germany, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2019. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Finally, the most recent reads on China's economy have also been soft, spurring a surprise cut to one of its key lending rates in late June.""The equity rally over the past two months implies macroeconomic scenarios that are even more positive than a soft landing. We maintain that this market action is largely a result of mechanical re-risking,"" Kolanovic went on to warn.Other pros suggest investors should be developing contingency plans such as rotating out of momentum tech trades and into relatively safer dividend-payers.""Whenever the stock market reaches today’s valuation levels, 'price' always falls to resolve the divergence. Therefore, investors should develop contingency strategies now … even if the resolution to today’s divergence doesn’t take place for a while,"" notes Miller Tabak chief markets strategist Matt Maley.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

If you want to see more stocks in his portfolio, check out Top 5 Stocks in Lee Ainslie’s Portfolio.Lee Ainslie is the face and the brains behind Maverick Capital, a high-profile hedge fund with a net worth of about $4 billion. Founded in 1993, the hedge fund primarily invests in stocks while staying clear of bonds, commodities, currencies, and options. Some of its notable holdings are in tech giants, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have helped reinvigorate the hedge fund's fortunes in recent months.Ainslie's bio is one that speaks volumes in addition to being the managing partner of Maverick Capital. Before founding the hedge fund in 1993, he was the managing director of Tiger Management. He also serves on the boards of Robin Hood Foundation  and the Economic  Club of New York. Lee Ainslie wife is Elizabeth Ainslie.The father of two, Ainslie has made a name for himself as a pure long/short equity investor. He primarily focuses on stocks he thinks will beat the market and sells those he thinks will underperform. Over the years, the hedge fund manager has beaten the S&amp;P 500 by 6% to 7% percentage points with 50% less volatility. Lee Ainslie net worth of over $1B stems from stellar performance of Maverick Capital hedge fund with bets on Salesforce  Facebook and Meta all of which have exploded in 2023.However, Ainslie had a first quarter to forget as Maverick Capital fell into the red, losing 22.9% compared to a 4.6% gain of the S&amp;P 500. One key factor behind the massive loss is the hedge fund's significant holding in Coupang, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the losses. The hedge fund's fortunes were also hurt by its biotech stocks holdings that remained under pressure.According to Ainslie, a decline in dollar volume M&amp;A activity in the biotech sector hurt the segment as the impact of discount rates on valuation multiple also fueled the weakness. Fast forward, the hedge fund appears to have found its footing thanks to Ainslie's solid stock picks, especially in the tech space.Story continuesInvestments in Amazon, Nvidia, Netflix, and Microsoft should help offset losses in other sectors as the tech stocks have posted double-digit gains amid the AI boom. In addition to betting big on tech giants, Ainslie is going short on housing and durable stocks as he does not expect spending on home improvements or furnishing to assume growth to the elevated levels recorded in 2021.In addition to shorting housing and durable stocks, Ainslie initiated a new position in Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI) in the first quarter of 2022, a high-quality, high-growth company on the right side of changes in healthcare. According to Ainslie, Masimo is a clear leader in pulse oximetry, a duopoly segment with contracts running five to seven years. Masimo products outperform those of its peers, resulting in better patient outcomes and lower patient costs. Therefore, the company boasts a solid recurring revenue base of 80% with an average customer retention rate of 98%.Lee Ainslie Washington Commanders and Other Investments.In Q1 2023, Maverick Capital's portfolio value declined from $4.22 billion to $3.95 billion.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 289 Maverick Capital % Portfolio:  2.21%Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one stock offering Ainslie with Maverick Capital exposure to software services and solutions design, development, and licensing.

Revenues grew +10% (foreign exchange adjusted) whereas operating income grew +14%, helped by +18% growth in Office365 and 31% growth in Azure and other cloud services. Although the Company guided to a deceleration in its core businesses, Microsoft has ample opportunity to drive attractive double-digit growth over a multi-year timeframe. We recognize investors have disproportionately favored software and tech stocks year to date, driving multiples to relative and historical highs. As a result, we paired some of our weighting in Microsoft earlier in the year; however, it remains a core position in portfolios.”8.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”7.

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden claims the strikes could cost the economy as much as $4 billion. Klowden explains how the Milken Institute studied a variety of businesses that support the entertainment industry and found that the strike was ""impacting all sorts of things in daily life that you don't think about."" Klowden details that the longer-term impacts of the conflict could affect local businesses nationwide, such as hotels, dry cleaners, restaurants, and many others.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Hollywood actors and writers are back out on the picket lines today for the second week of a historic double strike. Our next guest says the work stoppage could result in a $4 billion hit to the economy, and it won't just be limited to Hollywood. Let's bring in Kevin Klowden. He's a chief global strategist at the Milken Institute.And Kevin, that $4 billion number you have put out has really been shared widely because when you think about the impact here, we're not talking just about studios, not just the content space, but much broader than that. How do you break down that $4 billion?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, what you look at is start with what happened back in the 2007/2008 strike. And when we looked at that and we did the analysis a number of years ago on it, we found that it was an impact in California. That number was really about what was going on when the industry was way more concentrated in California than it even is now.And we saw it impacting all sorts of things in daily life you don't think about. We looked at it and we talk to people, and it was affecting restaurants and catering companies. It was affecting trucking companies, it was affecting welders, it was affecting construction people, it was affecting dry cleaners, it was affecting all sorts of businesses in hospitality and otherwise.And what you realize is that and a strike like this, especially as it's expanded as it's not just the writers this time with the actors, it's a total stoppage and almost everything that's scripted that it's not just impacting these industries in California. But it's really doing so in New York, it's doing it in Atlanta. It's doing it in Albuquerque, it's doing it in Pittsburgh. It's doing it in all sorts of places where filming actually takes place.Story continuesAnd we think of Hollywood as this great center, but it's because of film incentives and because of the way that the industry works, a huge amount of that filming is scattered all over that country. And that means that the economic impacts aren't just in California, but they're elsewhere.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Kevin, it's worth noting that $4 billion number, that would be double the damage caused from the last strike which happened in 2007 with the writers. And I'm curious to get your perspective, given how far apart the unions seem to be from the studios, how long could this go, and who do you think will be first to cave?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, I think ultimately, both sides will have to cave. And the problem is, you have to get to that point. Right now, it doesn't seem like either side is ready to. The studios think that they can outlast the writers and the actors because they'll undergo economic pressures, they'll have rent payments, mortgage payments, basic utilities, cost of life issues.And the actors and the writers think that the studios are going to run into issues with content. And it really depends for each of them who will be under the biggest amount of pressure. Netflix likes to say, hey, we've got enough that we can last into next year. But Netflix is just streaming, and they do have other things they can bring in.The question is, as they bring in international content like they did during the pandemic, do they start bleeding out subscribers? They've been adding them recently, especially with some of the moves they've made. But what happens if they take a hit? What happens if the studios don't have enough for the networks? What if they don't have enough for their fall slots? And all of those are issues that are going to come in.And right now, nobody's really in a great position coming out of the damage from the pandemic, coming out of the issues that have been placed in this. And the uncertainty around revenue on streaming. Everybody's in a precarious position. Nobody really wanted the strike. But at the same time, both sides see the current situation as not viable.AKIKO FUJITA: And Kevin, you have to wonder the longer this goes on, whether there's going to be some kind of division between what we like to think is more of the tech-facing companies like an Apple or a Netflix, and then the traditional studios like a WarnerMedia as well as Paramount. I want to get back to that number, the 4 billion number that you mentioned. If you think about SAG-AFTRA, you think about WGA, they've obviously got funds that are helping support some members.There's the below the line-- what's described as below the line, I should say-- the craft services, others who are all part of that team that goes into movies. What do you anticipate the impact there to be? If we're talking restaurants, for example, that are fundamentally supported by some of these shoots, I mean, what's going to happen there? How do you assess the economic impact on that front?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, unfortunately, you have to watch and wait. That's part of what we're looking at when we're estimating an impact is that last time around-- and this is a number of years ago before we had a whole bunch of inflation and other issues. But when we were estimating it, we had to look at things on, did it impact rentals of apartments?Did it impact business closures? How many people got laid off in hospitality? How many people got laid off in other secondary businesses? What kind of longer term impacts do you actually wind up seeing? And unfortunately, that data is lagging. So we're only guessing a very educated guess. But we're still trying to sort that out.The longer this goes on, the more that a number of these businesses who were already hit by the pandemic and having to stay closed or only have to deal with customers coming in doing takeaway if you're a restaurant or even if you're a dry cleaner, whether there's very limited activity or anything else. Those kinds of pressures are already there.So a number of these businesses may be more cash-poor than they might have been otherwise. And so we're watching and waiting to see, do they operate by basically reducing the number of employees? Do they operate by potentially shutting down a number of days? Or are they not able to make rent?And let alone, you have a number of real estate companies who had gone in, who had bought studio spaces because the increase in the amount of filming, they've invested heavily in this industry, not just in California, but all over the country. How much do they get hit? How much do investors get hit? How much does all of these secondary groups get hit.And meanwhile, you have a whole bunch of content creators who are like, well, I can just go on YouTube or TikTok, I can film from my own personal camera, do something to see if they can find alternate ways. And for the below the line people in particular, there are a lot of people we found in the last strike where they left.We found it took a year for the industry to recover because a lot of people basically were like, I can't make ends meet. This is too much. They moved, they go into different jobs, other things happen, let alone all the delays in filming.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Kevin, speaking of businesses that were hard hit by the pandemic, I want to talk about the theater chains because Moody's was out with a new report last week saying that movie theaters will be hardest hit by the double strike the longer it goes on considering their reliance on new content. Do you agree with that? And what do you think it could mean for the future of the box office?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the future of the box office has already been hit. If you looked at it pre-pandemic, you were already seeing a declining number of people going to the movies except for events, for things that they were particularly motivated by like ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" and what this means now is if you don't have those polls to get people into the theaters, they're going to have to rely on coming up with various alternatives that try and draw people in. But nothing brings people in like a new release. And the movie theater chains already were hit very hard during the pandemic because they were shut down in a number of different parts of the country for extended periods. So for them, this could be even more of a make or break moment, especially if the content disappears for an extended stretch of a few months.AKIKO FUJITA: The Milken Institute's Kevin Klowden, good to get your insights. We'll continue to follow the strike to see where things go. Appreciate the insight today.KEVIN KLOWDEN: My pleasure.]"

(NASDAQ:NFLX) plunged over 8% last Thursday following the release of its second-quarter earnings report. While the report was predominantly positive, it failed to impress Wall Street, leaving investors uncertain and unenthusiastic.The decline comes after an impressive year-to-date surge, triggered by the introduction of a more affordable ad-supported plan and a crackdown on password sharing. These initiatives were expected to fuel growth for the streaming giant. However, despite these efforts, the market sentiment has shifted, leading to the recent sell-off in the stock.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HLF. Click here to check it out. NFLX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NFLXPeter Lynch Chart of NFLXNetflix: There Is More to the StoryRegardless, investors can remain optimistic about the company's ongoing success. Several elements indicate a promising future, including Netflix's capacity to leverage its wide-ranging user base, improve profit margins and create greater free cash flows.The streaming giant's core strategy is delivering content and maintaining a clear revenue structure. I do not see any major change, so I remain optimistic about its outlook.Earnings reviewNetflix's earnings report showed mixed results, leading to a decline in its shares. While the company attracted nearly 6 million new subscribers, its net income of $1.49 billion increased from the prior-year quarter. Its earnings per share of $3.29 also topped estimates of $2.86. Revenue of $8.19 billion fell short of analysts' projections of $8.30 billion.Further, the company's forecast for third-quarter revenue of $8.52 billion was below analysts' projections of $8.67 billion. Netflix Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann remained optimistic, expressing confidence in the company's performance and anticipating revenue acceleration.Response to challengesThe company's efforts to tackle subscriber growth, included raising rates, introducing cheaper ad-based subscriptions and addressing password sharing among non-cohabiting users, appear to be paying off. Although the company faced a decline in early 2022, it has recorded a rebound in new subscribers.Story continuesIn response to the ongoing Hollywood strikes, Co-CEO Ted Sarandos expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of progress. Still, the company increased its free cash flow for the year to around $5 billion due to lower cash content spent amid the strikes.Despite these initiatives, investor sentiment was not positively impacted by the quarterly figures, leading to a reversal. Nevertheless, given its recent strategic measures, the company's growth story remains compelling.Why slowing growth is not a problemThe prospects for Netflix's ongoing success and potential growth are based on a multi-faceted investment thesis. Several crucial elements contribute uniquely to its robust position in the streaming market.First, Netflix strategically aims to rekindle growth through various innovative efforts, such as its stance against password sharing and introducing an ad-supported tier. These measures show early signs of success and are designed to increase subscription numbers and revenue.Second, the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the difficulties faced by its competitors, which could allow it to increase its market share. This also allows Netflix to augment its content library through strategic licensing agreements, thus attracting more subscribers.A third key factor is the evolution of the broader market, with the growing streaming industry representing a substantial opportunity for Netflix to penetrate further into the market.Financial prospectsFrom a financial perspective, Netflix's prospects are encouraging. The potential gain in market share and a promising upcoming content slate suggest higher-than-anticipated growth in the near to mid-term. The company also aims to achieve Ebit margins exceeding 20% by introducing a more profitable ad tier and benefiting from operational efficiencies due to its increasing scale.Despite investments in new content and currency fluctuations affecting its operating margin, the company expects positive margin shifts, increasing from 18% in 2022 to 20% in 2023. This is expected to result from stabilizing revenue growth, a weakening dollar, cost-cutting measures and entering the high-margin ad sector.The projection of these healthy margins suggest Netflix will likely remain the only profitable streaming platform. In summary, combining innovative strategies, savvy market positioning, the potential for market expansion and solid financial objectives strongly back the forecast for Netflix's continued growth and market dominance.Valuation is normalizingNetflix's financial analysis reveals a complex situation for investors. While the company is expected to have healthy revenue and earnings per share margins, its stock is not considered significantly undervalued. Currently trading at 45.53 times earnings, the stock is relatively expensive compared to traditional valuation metrics.One key factor influencing Netflix's market perception is its inclusion in the FAANG group. This categorization emphasizes growth and technological innovation over traditional valuation metrics, contributing to the historically high price-earnings ratio.Over the past decade, the company's earnings multiple has fluctuated significantly, with a minimum of 15.93, a median of 127.44 and a maximum of 629.53. The current price-earnings ratio of 45.53 is still considerably higher than the industry median of 18.10, indicating shares are more expensive relative to earnings than most of its peers in the diversified media industry.However, Netflix's classification among the FAANG group means that investors view it differently, focusing more on growth prospects, market leadership and its disruptive business model. Despite its high price-earnings ratio, the company remains an attractive option for those with a long-term growth strategy.Were the company's subscriber and revenue growth to slow down significantly, there might be a risk of reclassification as a traditional media company, leading to a revaluation of its stock.Investors should understand that rather than traditional metrics, Netflix's valuation is driven more by growth and market potential. Long-term growth-oriented investors may continue to find value in the company, while conservative investors seeking immediate returns might explore other opportunities within the media industry.TakeawayWhile the stock may not be considered a bargain, Netflix's ability to consistently generate revenue growth and adapt to changing consumer preferences solidifies its position as a best-in-class player.As the streaming market continues to expand, Netflix's strengths and market leadership position it well for future success, making it an attractive choice for investors seeking to capitalize on the long-term growth potential of the entertainment industry.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the hedge fund manager’s portfolio, head directly to Tom Russo's Top 5 Holdings. Thomas A. Russo has been a partner at Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner, now Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn, since 1989 and became the managing member in 2014. Russo's stock selection approach considers value and price together, seeking companies with strong cash-flow characteristics and robust balance sheets. His investment philosophy centers on a few industries known for generating sustainable net free cash flow, such as food, beverage, tobacco, and advertising-supported media. He aims for an absolute return of 10% to 20% per year with minimal turnover. In its latest 13F filing for the first quarter of 2023, Russo’s hedge fund disclosed $9.6 billion in managed securities, with the top 10 holdings making up 80.64% of the portfolio. During a May 2023 interview with Markets Insider, Russo expressed deep concern over the US government's aggressive borrowing and the potential long-term impact on Americans. In January 2023, the US government surpassed its borrowing limit of $31.4 trillion, and if an agreement isn't reached to raise the debt ceiling, it could face a cash shortage by June. However, even if the deadlock is resolved, there will still be a significant amount of debt that future generations will have to deal with, according to Russo. The current banking turmoil is driven, in part, by rate hikes which are negatively affecting bond prices. This situation has elicited fears that nervous lenders might pull back, leading to a credit crunch. Nevertheless, Tom Russo argued that concerns about the economy collapsing and lending drying up might be exaggerated. He pointed out that there is an abundance of cash in the system, which has kept stock prices relatively high despite the prevailing headwinds. Additionally, there are asset-price bubbles in various industries that remain a cause for caution.Story continuesAs of the first quarter of 2023, Tom Russo's largest holding is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), where he owns 2,579 shares valued at $1.20 billion. At the end of February 2023, Tom Russo joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio, and the significance of compounding. In 1982, Russo was introduced to Warren Buffett, and at that time, Berkshire Hathaway shares were priced at around $5.00 to $7.00 per share. Since then, the compound return on the investment has been an impressive 19.5%, making it a rewarding wait, as per Russo. He noted that a key principle at Berkshire is to send money to Omaha, where Warren Buffett and other skilled investors can direct its use. Berkshire's subsidiary businesses excel in their respective fields, but they don't always need constant reinvestment. By centralizing the capital in Omaha, the experienced investors can decide how to deploy it best. This approach ensures a steady and strong pace of growth and prevents operating managers from making potential investment mistakes outside their core businesses. In a recent interview, Russo outlined that Warren Buffett's investment of over $11 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) over the past 15 months may be a strategic hedge against rising energy costs. With Berkshire Hathaway holding almost a 24% stake in Occidental, the increase in oil prices would lead to higher profits for Occidental, which could help offset rising fuel costs at Buffett's other major businesses like Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF Railway. Russo commended this approach, calling it a clever and unconventional investment, similar to Buffett's previous strategy of utilizing ""float"" from his insurance companies.Don't Miss: Viking Global's Performance, AUM, and Long-Term StocksSimilarly, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), where Russo owns a $899 million stake, announced on July 18 that it has partnered with payments processing company Geidea, which will utilize Mastercard's latest technology to implement BIN ranges, allowing consumers, merchants, and fintechs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to access advanced payment solutions. Starting from July 21, visitors and tourists also have the option to connect their Mastercard accounts with China's renowned mobile payment platforms. This integration enables them to conveniently book taxis, use the subway, and make purchases at numerous outlets across the cashless nation. This development represents a renewed initiative by Alipay and WeChat Pay to accommodate foreign credit cards, following their earlier limited access attempts in late 2019.Investors who seek guidance from popular Wall Street hedge fund managers can check out some of the best stocks in Tom Russo’s portfolio as of Q1 2023, which include Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Delivering performance through fundamental, bottom-up stock selection has been a constant over our tenure managing the Strategy. We underperformed in the first half of 2022 from being too early in entering several stocks going through negative earnings revisions and have seen relative results rebound over the last 12 months due to better stock picking, especially among earnings reset names such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn’s Stake Value: $506,886,095Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is involved in businesses such as insurance, freight rail transportation, and utilities worldwide. It is one of Tom Russo’s top stock picks. In the first quarter of 2023, Russo’s hedge fund owned 1.64 million shares worth $506.8 million, representing 5.25% of the total holdings. On July 10, Berkshire Hathaway Energy reached an agreement to purchase Dominion Energy's 50% ownership in the Cove Point LNG plant in Maryland for a total of $3.3 billion.

(NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 20 million shares worth $6 billion. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Berkshire Hathaway is our oldest position. We have held it for almost 11 years, and it has been our largest position for most of that time. We have told you so much about Berkshire through the years that it is difficult not to repeat ourselves.BRK is our core investment, and I would describe our view on the company this way: If I had to invest all my money in a single stock and could not touch it at all for 5–10 years, then I would choose BRK without any hesitation. It is a conglomerate consisting of individual investments the quality of which is well above average, with efficiency in capital allocation that is far above average, having an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, and with very low business risk.All this comes at a valuation that is significantly below the market average. BRK’s earnings power, the determination of which requires a thorough understanding of its business and a good bit of manual labor, is somewhere just north of USD 50 billion a year. Therefore, the entire company, with its market capitalisation of USD 590 billion, trades at less than 12 times annual earnings. It is very realistic to expect BRK’s stock price to grow at an average rate of about 10% per year over the long term…” (Click here to see the full text)8. Philip Morris International Inc.

(NYSE:PM) declined in the period on concerns related to supply-chain disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine, which we view as temporary.

Joining Yahoo Finance Live, Krisiloff breaks down the outlook for markets, housing trends, the Fed's interest rate hike decision, and economic recoveries seen overseas, including China.Video TranscriptJARED BLIKRE: Earnings season, that is off to a full-swing start here. And last week, we saw a major banks coming out. Tesla, they released their quarterly earnings as well, and so did Netflix. And now, the much-anticipated Big Tech earnings are set to be released throughout the week here. But what can investors take away from results this season? And what should they be focused on?Let's bring in Avondale Asset Management Founder and Editor of ""The Transcript,"" Scott Krisiloff to give us his insights into what we've been seeing so far. Always great to see you here, Scott. And you've been perusing the transcripts as I know you have, and we got some big bank earnings. The tone pretty good with respect to the consumer and the economy so far, recession potential down the line. Just a smattering, what have you been-- what have you been seeing here?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah. I mean, it's more of the same that we've seen for the last couple of quarters, which is a resilient economy, resilient consumer. I think there's a lot of optimism still. I think the biggest, most noteworthy thing that we saw in the last week was that capital markets seemed to be ready to start opening as well. Banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley talking about robust pipelines in their investment banking business. Really starting to see optimism come through.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I noted-- I've noticed I go down to the New York Stock Exchange every day, seeing some big high-profile IPOs in the market. Want to talk about some other stuff that's happening. Huge trends in AI. Resurgence in interest this year-- I should say surge in interest this year. How are companies talking about AI on their earnings calls?Story continuesSCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I think there's a lot of interest in AI. Obviously, it's been a big driver of capital markets, or tech companies in the NASDAQ really getting a boost from AI expectations.I think one quote that really stood out to me was from Taiwan Semi which we had in our newsletter this week, which talked about how the short-term hype in AI is something that may not carry through in the medium term but is likely to persist in the long term that the AI wave will continue to grow. But short-term expectations are extremely high. And that isn't necessarily working its way through to earnings, even for the semiconductor companies in the near term.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, it seems like that's going to take years to play out, but that's just my opinion. I also want to get your take on the residential real estate markets. We've seen mixed figures out of housing. But despite mortgage rates at 7%, 8% in some areas, we see-- we still see huge, huge demand for housing.SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, that's an incredible dynamic that's happening in the housing market. It's tough to explain, honestly. You know, mortgage rates up a lot but still demand there. I think the biggest contributor to it is the fact that supply has been held low. And in some ways, higher mortgage rates are contributing to that.So if you already bought into a house, have a lower mortgage rate, it's hard to move and justify going to a much higher rate. So that's helping to keep supply low, which is helping to keep prices supported. But even demand is staying strong, it appears, despite these high interest rates.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and just thinking about the Federal Reserve, which goes hand in hand with the rates, those are longer-term rates. When we think about the Fed, we think about short-term rates, lots of expectations for this week's big announcement. But the consensus is that the Fed hikes this week, but then, are they done? What are the-- what are some of the banks saying on the transcripts?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I mean, I think most companies are expecting for the Fed to hike one, maybe two more times, but really focusing in on one and then pause for a while, which is exactly what Jerome Powell has been for-- trying to say to markets-- get markets behind-- is that interest rates may stay higher for a little bit longer in order to fight inflation. But I think people are thinking that we're pretty close to the end here on the interest rate increases, which I think is probably part of the reason why stock prices are a little bit more buoyant this year as well.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and the proof remains in the pudding. We'll have to see what comes this Wednesday. We're going to be bringing that live for everybody. Also want to talk about the international front, especially China, the reopening. We know by now it's taken a lot longer, and it's been a lot slower than anticipated. Any signs that it's picking up, or is there just a general malaise over there?SCOTT KRISILOFF: I think we're still seeing a general malaise over there from what we're picking up in earnings calls. I think that as much of the story about China reopening and the obviously draconian COVID policies that they followed for several years, I think international companies are hesitant to be investing in China with the geopolitics in the country today.And so, you're actually seeing one of the trends that we think is most interesting, is the nearshoring, onshoring, reshoring of industrial capacity. In the United States-- North America, one of the countries that's benefiting is Mexico. And you're also seeing companies do that in Europe as well. But I think without as much foreign direct investment going into China, that's probably helping to slow their economy as well.JARED BLIKRE: And circling back to the consumer, you're noting in some of your writings today, there are elevated delinquencies in auto loan growth slowing and other areas. So the consumer, as we have been saying, is resilient, but there are some maybe warning signs on the horizon.SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, absolutely. I think the way that we are interpreting this at this point is just a general slowing of the economy. But on a nominal basis, inflation adjusted or including inflation, the growth rates were so high for the last couple of years that even if you come back to 5%, 4%, 3% growth even which is a more normalized growth rate, it feels like it's much slower than it was. And it is a slowdown. It's a quantitative slowdown from where we were. But that doesn't necessarily mean we're seeing negative growth at this point or recessionary-type dynamics.JARED BLIKRE: Excellent to point out there and noted. Thank you as always.

125,9b77d7b8-29bb-378c-be79-69b20596890e,AMGN,2023-07-25,Mirati (MRTX) Down 7% on CHMP's Opinion on Krazati Filing,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mirati-mrtx-down-7-chmps-152300896.html,1690212180,STORY,"['MRTX', 'AMGN']","[Shares of Mirati MRTX were down 7.4% on Jul 21, after the European Medicine Agency's (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) did not recommend approving the company’s conditional marketing authorisation application (“MAA”) for Krazati (adagrasib) in KRASG12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).The CHMP noted that the Krazati MAA does not fulfill certain requirements for a conditional approval. Mirati was unable to show that Krazati fulfils an unmet need. Per the CHMP, the data supporting the MAA was not comprehensive and there were uncertainties on how well the drug worked.However, Mirati disagrees with the CMP’s recommendation and believes that Krazati possesses a differentiated clinical profile compared to Amgen’s AMGN Lumakras/Lumykras, an approved KRASG12C inhibitor. Management intends to request for a formal re-examination of the opinion.The above CHMP opinion will not impact any of Mirati’s clinical studies. The company is currently enrolling participants in the confirmatory phase III KRYSTAL-12 study evaluating Krazati monotherapy against docetaxel in second-line NSCLC. Data from this confirmatory study, which is expected to support full approval for Krazati, is expected in first-half 2024.If the re-examination is not successful, it could delay Krazati’s EU launch by more than a year since data from the KRYSTAL-12 study will not be available till next year.The MAA is supported by data from the phase II registration-enabling cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating the drug in patients with KRASG12C mutated advanced NSCLC, previously treated with a platinum-based regimen and an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The study achieved an objective response rate of 43% at the median duration of response being 8.5 months.Krazati was granted accelerated approval by the FDA last December to Krazati for previously-treated KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This approval was also based on data from the KRYSTAL-1 study.Story continuesIn the year so far, Mirati’s shares have declined 30.9% compared with the industry’s 10.0% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTumors characterized by KRAS mutations are extremely difficult to directly inhibit and are commonly associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. KRAS G12C mutations are present in approximately 14% of NSCLC adenocarcinomas patients, 3-4% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and smaller percentages of several other difficult-to-treat cancers. Krazati will be launched as a tablet formulation for advanced NSCLC patients who have a KRAS mutation and progressed beyond a first-line treatment.Mirati is evaluating adagrasib — as monotherapy and combinations — in multiple cohorts of the KRYSTAL-1 study across multiple solid tumors that harbor KRASG12C mutations. These include the combination of adagrasib with Merck’s Keytruda in NSCLC, the combination with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Gilotrif (afatinib) in advanced NSCLC and Eli Lilly’s Erbitux (cetuximab) in advanced CRC. In several other studies, adagrasib is being evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for advanced KRASG12C- mutated solid tumors, including NSCLC, colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer.In the United States, Krazati competes with Amgen’s Lumakras/Lumykras, which was approved for second-line NSCLC in the United States in 2021 and Europe in January 2022. The Amgen drug has been launched in more than 50 countries. Amgen’s Lumakras/Lumykras is off to an excellent start, while its label expansion studies, which have the potential to significantly expand the currently addressable patient population, are progressing rapidly.Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.

126,926fcd25-6be8-3e71-8d2d-62ac0d01104c,AMGN,2023-07-25,Amgen Inc. (AMGN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-amgn-trending-stock-130006381.html,1690203606,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +3.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has lost 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.40 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.70 points to a change of +0.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.51 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amgen is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.63 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.6%. The $26.88 billion and $30.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.1% and +13.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.1%. EPS of $3.98 for the same period compares with $4.25 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.66%. The EPS surprise was +3.65%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

130,05339162-540f-3e7e-b908-dfb1aef09749,NEM,2023-07-25,10 Best Gold Stocks Under $50,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-gold-stocks-under-185031808.html,1690224631,STORY,"['GC=F', 'SI=F', 'HG=F', 'SSRM', 'NGD', 'OR', 'BTG', 'KGC', 'GOLD', 'NEM', 'CDE']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best gold stocks under $50. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the gold industry, head directly to 5 Best Gold Stocks Under $50. Previously, we reported that The World Gold Council said that there was a 13% decline in Q1 gold demand (excluding OTC) compared to the previous year. However, there were some positive trends, such as higher demand from Chinese consumers and central bank buying. On the other hand, ETFs and India's weakness had a negative impact on the overall demand. When including OTC, the total gold demand showed a 1% year-on-year increase, reaching 1,174 tonnes. This growth was attributed to the recovery in OTC investment, which balanced out the weaknesses observed in certain areas, in line with investor positioning in the futures market. During the first quarter, central banks saw remarkable growth in demand for gold, with official sector institutions showing continuous interest and purchasing 228 tonnes of gold to bolster their reserves worldwide. The World Gold Council forecasted that investment in gold will exhibit healthy growth throughout the year, but the outlook for fabrication, including jewelry and technology, is not as strong. Central bank buying is expected to remain robust, although it is not likely to reach the levels recorded in 2022. As for mine production and recycling, both are projected to demonstrate modest growth.According to The World Gold Council’s July 2023 report, during the first six months of the year, the price of gold rose by 5.4% in USD, reaching a closing value of US$1,912.25 per ounce in June. Gold exhibited better performance than most other valuable assets, except for developed market stocks. Apart from providing positive returns to investor portfolios, gold played a crucial role in reducing overall volatility during the first half of the year, particularly during the mini-banking crisis in March.Don't Miss: 15 Best Gold Mining Stocks To Buy NowBased on the findings of an annual survey of central banks conducted by the World Gold Council, it is evident that developing countries are actively looking to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. These emerging economies often find themselves vulnerable to the impact of U.S. Federal Reserve policies and are now turning towards gold as a means to protect themselves from the uncertainties associated with the dollar. The survey revealed a notable difference in perspectives between the monetary policymakers in advanced economies and those in developing markets, signaling significant implications for the United States. One such consequence includes potential challenges in funding large and persistent trade deficits, and consequently, affecting American living standards. This trend of shifting away from the dollar in favor of gold could have notable repercussions on the global economic landscape. Although central banks play an important role in the gold market and have contributed to the recent surge in gold prices, it is essential to note that they are not involved in buying gold for speculative purposes. Instead, the primary reason for central banks to hold gold is to hedge against inflation and maintain its value over the long term. The World Gold Council’s annual report stated: Story continues“This divergence of views is perhaps most striking in terms of the outlook for the U.S. dollar and gold. Developing economies appear to be more pessimistic about the U.S. dollar’s future and more optimistic about gold’s.”Also read: 20 Countries With Highest Gold Consumption By YearAmid this optimistic global gold landscape, some of the best gold stocks to buy include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC). Our Methodology We selected the gold stocks which were priced under $50 as of July 24 and sorted them based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

133,409c11ac-5a5f-312e-98bc-57c2d72e0faf,NRG,2023-07-25,What Makes NRG (NRG) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-nrg-nrg-buy-stock-160006417.html,1690214406,STORY,['NRG'],"[NRG Energy (NRG) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for NRG is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for NRG imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for NRGFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this power company is expected to earn $4.66 per share, which is a change of 77.9% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for NRG. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of NRG to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that more rate hikes are expected this year. The “dot plot” of the June FOMC showed that the majority of Fed officials expected two more rate hike of 25 basis points each this year.The inflation rate stayed elevated well above the central bank’s 2% target rate despite a stiff fall from its 40-year peak in June 2022. The major concern for the Fed is a resilient U.S. labor market. Although job additions in June were lower than expectations, it was in line with the historical average. Moreover, the wage rate remained sticky downward.Market participants are expecting the Fed to hike the benchmark interest rate again in the July FOMC meeting. At present, the CME FedWatch indicates almost a 100% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25-5.5% in July. No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025.The expectation for the terminal interest rate for the ongoing rate hike cycle is currently 5.6%, instead of the 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting. Several economists and financial experts remained concerned that higher interest rate may lead to a near-term recession.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

The company's regulated utilities business, Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL), onboarded 66,000 more customers year-on-year, while its clean energy unit, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), added 1,665 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects in the second quarter.""Wind resource performed significantly better than our expectations ... potentially highlighting NEER's diverse asset base and/or asset efficiency versus competitors,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Shelby Tucker.The company's new renewables and storage backlog now stands at nearly 20 gigawatts (GW) after it placed about 1.8 GW of power into service in the reported quarter.NextEra expects FPL to add nearly 3,100 MW of incremental solar power through 2025, the company said in a call with analysts.Its quarterly revenue rose nearly 42% to $7.35 billion, beating estimates of $6.23 billion, according to Refinitiv data.On an adjusted basis, it earned 88 cents per share in the quarter, topping analysts' average estimate of 82 cents.(Reporting by Arshreet Singh; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Vinay Dwivedi)]"

143,b8ac9a38-a7cd-3c8e-9de9-305d465ddad8,MAS,2023-07-25,Soft Consumer Spending to Hurt Masco's (MAS) Q2 Earnings Y/Y,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soft-consumer-spending-hurt-mascos-124600021.html,1690202760,STORY,"['MAS', 'OC']","[Masco Corporation MAS is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27, before the market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings and net sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.9% and 3.1%, respectively. However, both the bottom and the top lines declined 8.4% and 10.1%, respectively on a year-over-year basis.Masco’s earnings have topped the consensus mark in nine of the trailing 13 quarters.The Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has remained unchanged at 95 cents over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 16.7% decline from the year-ago level.Masco Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMasco Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMasco Corporation price-eps-surprise | Masco Corporation QuoteFor net sales, the consensus mark is pegged at $2,095 million, suggesting a decline of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Let's check out the factors that are likely to have influenced the quarter.Key Factors at PlayMasco is likely to have witnessed lower net sales on a year-over-year basis in second-quarter 2023. Restricted consumer spending and increased interest rates, reflecting soft housing demand, are expected to have ailed Masco’s revenue performance. Owing to economic uncertainties, the consumers are more selective and price conscious, reflecting the comparatively lower spending on a year-over-year basis. Given the headwinds, Masco’s solid brand portfolio and long-term growth initiatives are likely to partially benefit its top-line growth.Geographically, for second-quarter 2023, our model predicts North America and International (mainly Europe) net sales to decline 11.9% and 8% year over year to $1,678.5 million and $411 million, respectively.Meanwhile, business segment-wise, Plumbing Products (accounted for 60.9% of 2022 net sales) and Decorative Architectural Products (accounted for 39.1% of 2022 net sales) segments net sales are likely to decline 10.5% and 12% year over year to $1,228.2 million and $861.3 million, respectively.Although Masco’s second-quarter results are expected to reflect tough year-over-year comparisons, the company is likely to register higher net sales and earnings sequentially, given the improving housing market scenario.For the second quarter, the bottom line of the company is likely to have been dented due to persisting inflationary pressures, lower volumes, high input costs and ongoing investments for long-term growth. These costs are expected to have had a negative impact on the company’s operations as well as hurt margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Owing to the aforementioned economic risks, our model predicts consolidated adjusted operating margin to decline 200 basis points year over year to 15.6% in the second quarter.Segment-wise, our model predicts the adjusted operating margin of the Plumbing Products segment to decline to 16.5% in the second quarter from 17.3% in the year-ago period. The same for the Decorative Architectural Products segment is currently pegged at 16.7%, reflecting a decrease from 20.2% reported a year ago.Story continuesWhat Our Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Masco this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Masco has an Earnings ESP of -2.40%.

However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that more rate hikes are expected this year. The “dot plot” of the June FOMC showed that the majority of Fed officials expected two more rate hike of 25 basis points each this year.The inflation rate stayed elevated well above the central bank’s 2% target rate despite a stiff fall from its 40-year peak in June 2022. The major concern for the Fed is a resilient U.S. labor market. Although job additions in June were lower than expectations, it was in line with the historical average. Moreover, the wage rate remained sticky downward.Market participants are expecting the Fed to hike the benchmark interest rate again in the July FOMC meeting. At present, the CME FedWatch indicates almost a 100% probability that the Fed will raise the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to a range of 5.25-5.5% in July. No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025.The expectation for the terminal interest rate for the ongoing rate hike cycle is currently 5.6%, instead of the 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting. Several economists and financial experts remained concerned that higher interest rate may lead to a near-term recession.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

Oil prices retreated.Wall Street's benchmark S&amp;P 500 index rose 0.3% on Tuesday after companies reported bigger profits than expected.Investors expect the Fed to raise its key lending rate on Wednesday by 0.25 percentage points to a 22-year high. They hope the U.S. central bank can manage a “soft landing,” extinguishing inflation while avoiding a recession.“This could be the last rate hike for the Fed” as inflation pressures ease, said Brad Bernstein of UBS Wealth Management in a report. Bernstein said central banks in Europe and Japan also are “near their pivot points” on their own rate hike cycles.Meanwhile, traders waited to see how China's ruling Communist Party will carry out its promise to shore up sluggish economic growth.

Expected July results represent a full calendar year worth of consecutive monthly sales growth (as measured in year-over-year unadjusted monthly volume comparisons), reflecting the recovery from the depths of the supply chain constraints realized through much of 2022. This volume would translate to an estimated sales pace of 16.1 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate: SAAR).""New light vehicle sales will continue to progress in July, reflecting the current trend of sustained demand levels to the fleet sector while retail sales continue to climb,"" said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""From both an economic growth and auto demand perspective, the first half of 2023 has proven once again that one shouldn't doubt the spending capacity of US consumers.""Commensurate with the better-than-expected economic and auto sales data over the past six months, S&amp;P Global Mobility has upgraded its calendar year 2023 US light vehicle sales forecast to 15.4 million units (up from 15.1 million in its previous forecast release).The  near-term outlook remains unclear as the new vehicle sales environment will be defined in the second half of the year by the dueling possibilities that auto consumers will be pressured by potential vehicle affordability issues (rising interest rates, credit tightening, still high vehicle prices) while at the same time, production advances could build back inventory more quickly than anticipated, setting up a scenario to alleviate some of the pricing pressures within the new vehicle market.Although the July 4 weekend represented a trifecta of the end of the month, end of the quarter, and a holiday weekend, the sales pattern for the weekend was consistent to preceding months-end in terms of sold inventory.Story continues""The long weekend took a chunk out of available advertised inventories – from 1.843 million in mid-June to 1.761 million on July 3,"" said Matt Trommer, associate director of Market Reporting at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""Perhaps more notable is that available inventories in mid-July almost immediately rebounded to 1.867 million, surpassing the year-to-date highs seen in mid-June.""Various industry-specific risk factors remain prevalent in the outlook for the remainder of the 2023, including the potential for North American vehicle supply disruptions as union negotiations take shape.""With some US manufacturers maintaining higher levels of inventory in relation to demand, North American production levels are expected to slow later this year, with the reduced volume effectively acting as risk mitigation for the high probability of a union strike,"" said Joe Langley, associate director, light vehicle production forecasting at S&amp;P Global Mobility.US Light Vehicle SalesJuly 23 (Est)June 23July 22Total Light VehicleUnits, NSA1,330,0001,370,9761,126,523In millions, SAAR16.115.713.3Light TruckIn millions, SAAR12.912.610.6Passenger CarIn millions, SAAR3.23.12.7Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility (Est), U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Light Vehicle Sales Comparisons BEV share holding steadyBattery electric vehicle (BEV) share is expected to represent 7.6% of July sales, remaining on trend with the preceding months.

149,301daecd-0d31-3b63-af85-edbb4b6cb2a6,SPGI,2023-07-25,Airlines in £700m slump as European wildfires throw summer holidays into doubt,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/301daecd-0d31-3b63-af85-edbb4b6cb2a6/airlines-in-%C2%A3700m-slump-as.html,1690218107,STORY,"['RYAAY', '^FTSE', 'EJTTF', 'SCPPF', 'VOD', 'SPGI', 'COMP', 'MNSKY', 'SAA.L', '^HSI', '^DJI', 'BABWF']","[Shares in Easyjet, British Airways owner IAG and Jet2 have sunk lower amid wildfires in Greece - REUTERS/Rafael MarchanteAlmost £700m was wiped off the value of London-listed airline stocks on Monday as family summer holidays were thrown into doubt by heatwaves and wildfires gripping Europe.Shares in Easyjet, British Airways-owner IAG, TUI, Wizz Air and Jet2 sunk lower as Greek authorities stepped up tourist evacuations from the popular resort islands of Rhodes and Corfu where blazes were sweeping across the countryside.Wizz Air shed 6.3pc, with Easyjet finishing 4.7pc lower and Jet2 down 4.4pc. TUI and IAG closed down 3.4pc and 1.8pc respectively.The London-listed travel stocks collectively shed £694m in value, according to Bloomberg terminal data. EasyJet, Jet2 and TUI were among those to confirm they were sending repatriation flights for British tourists to Greece on Monday.Alex Macheras, an independent aviation analyst, said extreme weather was becoming yet another risk airlines were having to plan for each summer, with strikes also hampering air traffic control operations and the Ukraine war still affecting some flight paths.He said: “Air travel is vulnerable to just about everything, from security risks to weather and climate-related issues and of course geopolitical issues.“Unfortunately, these wildfires and heat waves are just another thing to add to an already-long list.”As well as the wildfires, investors were also spooked by a warning from budget carrier Ryanair that demand for air fares risks cooling as households grapple with surging mortgage payments.The Irish carrier also cut its full year passenger growth forecast to 183.5 million, down from previous guidance for 185 million, blaming delays in deliveries of new Boeing aircraft.Ryanair warned that demand for last-minute bookings had softened in late June and early July. The budget airline said it might need to lower fares this winter to boost takeup as higher interest rates squeezed household budgets.Neil Sorahan, the airline’s finance chief, said: “What we have found in previous slowdowns - if you go back to the global financial crisis - is that people didn’t stop travelling, they just became more price-conscious.Story continues“The question mark is: Will we have to stimulate pricing or not to fill the planes? I don’t know whether we will have to do so in winter or not.”The weak outlook sent Ryanair’s shares down 6pc in Dublin.The slump came despite the airline announcing it had almost quadrupled its profits in the three months to the end of June, thanks to booming demand over Easter and the coronation weekend.Ryanair made a profit of £574m in its first quarter, up from £147m a year earlier.Fares were 42pc higher, while passenger traffic grew 11pc against weak comparisons a year earlier when demand was impacted following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Mr Sorahan said employment remained high, meaning workers retained paid annual leave and were “still very keen to use that”.He added that Ryanair would be able to grow market share if fares came under pressure in the months ahead.Mr Sorahan said: “That’s really where our model comes into its own. You know, our average fare in the quarter just ended was €49, which puts us in the price bracket of most people.“So given the cost advantage that we have over everybody else, given the strength of the balance sheet, that gives us a big opportunity to go out and grow market share if there is a pullback.”Despite potential price cuts over winter, Mr Sorahan said average air fares were set to remain above pre-Covid levels for up to four years following cutbacks in capacity during the pandemic.Read the latest updates below.05:25 PM BSTFTSE 100 closes slightly upThe FTSE 100 edged higher by 0.2pc on Monday, supported by a jump in retailer Ocado and gains in energy stocks.Ocado led with a 14.3pc rise to 785p, following its £200m settlement from its ‘robot wars’ lawsuit with Norwegian company Autostore.Vodafone rose by 4.1pc after reporting strong revenue growth in the first quarter of its financial year.Meanwhile the travel and leisure sector lost 0.8pc after Ryanair reported a softening in fares. The airline was down 6.1pc, Easyjet and Wizz Air Holdings also reported losses and were down 4.4pc and 6.4pc respectively.Martin Sorrell’s S4 Capital fell 21.2pc after the company announced lower-than-expected revenues in May and June this year. It cut its forecasts for full-year revenue to between 2pc and 4pc, a sharp decrease from previous expectations of between 6pc and 10pc.05:00 PM BSTPrimark expands click and collect to keep up with rivalsFast fashion giant Primark is expanding its click and collect trial across Greater London stores in a bid to keep up with rival stores.The trial, which up until now was exclusively available to North West London stores, will now be rolled out across the capital. Customers will be able to select clothing and collect it from stores across London locations including Oxford Street and both Westfield shopping centres.At its last results, in six months to March, its parent company Associated British Foods reported that sales at the budget clothing store had risen by 10pc.Kari Rodgers, UK retail director at Primark said: “The service is now available in around a third of our UK stores, giving even more customers the added choice and convenience that click and collect offers and complementing experience within our stores.”04:36 PM BSTChevron considers lithium production in latest EV betOil and gas company Chevron is considering opportunities to use lithium in electric vehicle batteries, its boss has told Bloomberg.Chief executive Mike Wirth has said that extracting lithium fits with the “core capabilities” of a company like Chevron that has a wealth of experience in oil and gas.This follows an announcement by Exxon Mobil chief executive Darren Woods who said the company is exploring opportunities to produce lithium.The lithium interest from US oil companies contrasts with their counterparts in Europe, which have been more aggressive in moving into the renewable energy space.04:05 PM BSTApple plans to keep iPhone shipments steady despite a slowdown in salesApple has asked suppliers to make around 85 million units of the iPhone 15 this year, roughly in line with last year, despite sales numbers sliding.The big tech company had recorded that sales had dropped by 2pc in the most recent quarter, however the company’s phone production levels remain steady, according to Bloomberg.Apple’s stock has grown by almost 50pc this year, pushing the company’s worth to $3 trillion.The big tech industry is grappling with sharp declines in demand for electronics from smartphones to computers, as corporations and consumers hold off on purchases in the face of surging prices and economic uncertainty.The US Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates again this week in an attempt to battle sky high inflation.03:53 PM BSTSunak warns that climate agenda should not be a “hassle” for votersThe Prime Minister has said that he will delay implementing environmental policies if they lead to direct costs on consumers after he is forced to rethink his strategies last week’s following elections.Rishi Sunak said: “We’re going to make progress to net zero. But we’re going to that in a proportionate and pragmatic way that doesn’t unnecessarily give people more hassle and more cost in their lives - that’s not what I’m interested in and prepared to do.”Mr Sunak’s party has long been torn over environmental issues and how to tackle them.Tory MPs including former business secretary Jacob Rees Mogg have used last week’s election results to demand a rethink on climate policies, including delaying the 2030 ban on sales of new fully petrol or diesel cars.The party managed to hold onto former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat.03:31 PM BST'Barbenheimer' weekend generates nearly £30m for UK box officeThe dual offerings of Barbie and Oppenheimer prompted the biggest weekend for UK cinema-going since 2019, according to the UK Cinema Association.Greta Gerwig’s film about the Mattel doll, played by Margot Robbie, having an existential crisis and Christopher Nolan’s epic about the “father” of the atomic bomb, generated almost £30m at the UK box office, said the group, which represents the interests of UK cinema operators.Cinema chain Vue said a fifth of its customers had purchased tickets to see both films in a double bill dubbed by social media as Barbenheimer. More than 2,000 of Vue’s Barbie screenings were sold out, according to the company.Tim Richards, chief executive and founder of Vue International, said:We knew it was going to be a big weekend based on the advanced bookings, which were also the biggest since the pandemic.The numbers are phenomenal. We had over 500,000 customers come to Vue on the weekend alone. We had 4,000 sold-out sessions, 2,000 sold-out sessions for Barbie alone.But I think that it’s not just about Barbie and Oppenheimer, it’s just a return to cinema.And with that, I will leave you in the capable hands of Riya Makwana for the rest of the day.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling attend the European premiere of ""Barbie"" in London - REUTERS/Maja Smiejkowska03:23 PM BSTBabcock shares on longest winning streak in 14 yearsShares in Babcock have risen for an 11th consecutive day, putting the defence company on course for its longest winning streak in 14 years.It comes after the FTSE 250 firm confirmed it is on track to deliver the first of five Type 31 warships to the UK next year in spite of its dispute with the Ministry of Defence over the project’s budget.The company’s shares have risen 0.6pc today to nearly £3.80.03:02 PM BSTTata Steel suffers 92pc fall in profits amid UK pension costsTata Steel has reported a 92pc decline in quarterly profit as it was hit with a charge on its UK pension scheme and grappled with weakness in its European operations.Group net income was 6.3bn rupees (£60m) in the three months to June, down from 77.7bn rupees a year earlier.That was better than analysts’ average estimate for a loss of 2.2bn rupees. Sales fell 6.2pc from a year earlier to 594.9bn rupees.Profitability was affected by a non-cash charge for deferred taxes on account of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS).“With this, the insurance buy-in of BSPS has been completed, successfully derisking Tata Steel UK,” it added.The Tata Steel plant in Scunthorpe - LINDSEY PARNABY/AFP/Getty Images02:36 PM BSTUS markets open higherWall Street moved higher at the opening bell as markets awaited a week of major company earnings.Interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan this week did not dampen the mood.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2pc higher at 35,306.17 while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.4pc to 4,554.96.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up by 0.5pc to 14,099.53.02:16 PM BSTOctopus Energy to invest £15.5bn in offshore windOctopus Energy has announced plans to invest £15.5bn in offshore wind projects and farms by 2030.The British energy group’s renewables generation arm said the money will go towards the generation of 12 gigawatts of renewable electricity per year, which is enough to power 10m homes.The investment will be targeted at existing wind farms, or those already under construction, as well as developers of new offshore wind across the world, with a focus on Europe.The sustainable energy and technology group, which already manages £6bn of green energy projects globally, revealed that it already has “several deals” in the pipeline.It said the investment would deliver more clean energy worldwide as well as create “numerous” jobs.Zoisa North-Bond, chief executive of Octopus Energy Generation, said: “Offshore wind has already rapidly transformed the UK’s energy system - and we’re incredibly excited about the potential for this technology globally.”The Walney Extension offshore wind farm near Blackpool - REUTERS/Phil Noble01:58 PM BSTWorld's largest battery energy storage project given go-aheadThe world’s largest battery energy storage site has been given the green light in Britain.Carlton Power is currently in “advanced talks” with companies to finance, build and operate the £750m project.The UK electric generation company has secured planning permission from local authorities for the one gigawatt site and commercial operations are expected toward the end of 2025.Work on the project is expected to start early next year at the Trafford Low Carbon Energy Park near Manchester.Power storage is considered one of the key obstacles to carbon-free electricity as it eases the burden of trying to balance the grid between times of high wind and solar output and peaks in power demand.The project “will make a significant contribution to the resilience of the North West’s energy system,” said Chris McKerrow, Carlton Power’s head of European battery energy storage scheme development.The UK wants to build 50 gigawatts offshore wind by 2030 but needs a stable technology as back up for periods when it is not windy.01:42 PM BSTGatwick strikes suspended after pay offers improvedStrikes by workers at Gatwick airport have been suspended, with union members either accepting or being balloted on new pay offers, it has been announced.Unite said planned strikes by DHL workers have been cancelled completely after they voted to accept a 15pc pay rise.General secretary Sharon Graham said:This is an excellent result secured by the steadfast position of our DHL members.Once again, workers are gaining real material benefits from Unite’s absolute focus on improving jobs, pay and conditions.ASC and Menzies workers are currently balloting on improved offers.If the ASC workers reject the pay offer, they will go ahead with strike action scheduled between July 28 and August 1 as well as strikes between August 4-8.Strikes by Menzies workers between July 28 and August 1 have been suspended but if the offer is rejected strikes between August 4-8 will go ahead.01:28 PM BSTOil price rises after signs of supply cutsOil has ticked higher after four weekly gains amid signs of a tighter market.Brent crude traded up 0.6pc at more than $81 a barrel in London, having gained roughly 10pc since late June.Prices have strengthened as Saudi Arabia and its partners in Opec+ cut supplies. International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol said over the weekend that the market could return to a supply deficit.However, US central bank policymakers are widely expected to deliver another rate increase at this week’s meeting in their push to rein in inflation and give guidance on the likelihood of additional moves.The tightening cycle risks tipping the world’s largest economy into recession, potentially harming demand.Oil remains lower this year despite the recent run of gains and production cuts by the Opec cartel and its allies, including Russia.On the demand side, China’s stalled recovery has been a persistent headwind for industrial commodities such as crude.The price of US benchmark WTI neared its moving average over the previous 200 days in April but failed to manage a close above that level.

No supplier is allowed to charge its standard tariff customers more than this, and the Government has provided support for these customers.Moneysupermarket also said that rising interest rates had hit other parts of its business. Sluggishness in the mortgage market helped contribute to the revenue at Moneysupermarket’s money division dropping 2pc to £51.9m in the six months to the end of June.The fall in revenue from mortgages had been somewhat offset by strong demand for credit cards. Overall revenue rose 11pc to £213.8m.Moneysupermarket does not expect customers to switch energy suppliers much this year - Moneysupermarket.com12:40 PM BSTWall Street expects boost from Meta and Microsoft resultsUS stock indexes edged higher in premarket trading as investors gear up for earnings from megacap growth and technology companies.Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are reporting this week, with traders expecting the big names to signal an end to the nearly year-long slowdown in their cloud businesses, while a pickup in digital ads is also expected to aid profits.Last week, Netflix and Tesla posted less-than-stellar quarterly reports.The electric-vehicle maker eased 1.3pc in premarket trading after UBS downgraded its rating on the stock, while other megacap growth and technology shares edged higher.The centrepiece event of the week is the Fed’s policy meeting, with the central bank expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.The tech-heavy Nasdaq has rallied 34pc so far this year, outperforming its Wall Street peers, as rate-sensitive megacap growth companies jumped on hopes of an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle and optimism over artificial intelligence.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1pc, the S&amp;P 500 had gained 0.2pc, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.3pc.12:08 PM BSTRyanair resists pressure to put on rescue flights to GreeceRyanair is resisting putting on emergency repatriation flights to Greece despite raging wildfires, with the budget airline insisting it will run schedules as normal today.Our special correspondent Matt Oliver has the latest:Ryanair’s announcement came as rival carriers including EasyJet, Jet2 and TUI dispatched additional planes to the island of Rhodes, where thousands of British holidaymakers are trying to flee.A notice on Ryanair’s website this morning said the airline’s flights in and out of Rhodes and Corfu, where there are also fires and evacuations, were “currently operating as normal and unaffected by the forest fires”.It added that passengers in Rhodes could seek help from Greek government officials at the island’s airport if they had lost their travel documents.Read how customers have responded.Wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes have left tourists stranded - WILL VASSILOPOULOS/AFP via Getty Images11:54 AM BSTWheat prices climb after missile attacks on Black Sea portWheat prices have advanced after Russia unleashed a fresh missile barrage against the Black Sea port city of Odesa at the weekend, extending a jump of more than 5pc last week.The 6.6pc increase in prices today followed Moscow’s decision to pull out of an agreement allowing Ukrainian crop exports last week.The missile attack damaged infrastructure, houses and other buildings, including some 25 landmarks in the city’s historic centre, a UNESCO World Heritage location.Ukraine is trying to restart trade through the Black Sea corridor after Russia withdrew from the UN-brokered pact early last week, although there’s doubt over whether the goal is realistic.In the meantime, Ukraine is turning to other avenues to export its grain, such as trains and barges.The world still has a large buffer of wheat stockpiles, and top exporter Russia continues to ship its own bumper crop to world markets.About 33m tons of crops were shipped to global destinations under the pact, including about 17m tons of corn and nine million tons of wheat. The top destination was China, followed by Spain, Turkey, Italy and the Netherlands.Elsewhere, lack of rains and heat are threatening crops in parts of the US and southern Europe, increasing risks to food supplies.A combine harvester in a wheat field near Kivshovata village in the Kyiv region - SERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP via Getty Images11:39 AM BSTMatalan hit by late start to summer weatherFashion retailer Matalan has reported a “challenging” first quarter as the cost-of-living squeeze on spending and the slow transition to summer weather weighed on the group’s sales.The low-cost clothing and homeware chain saw its total revenues fall by 8pc to £264m in the three months to May 27, compared to £287m made in the same period last year.Matalan, which has 230 stores across the UK and 48 franchised shops overseas, said it had noticed an impact from shoppers spending less on non-essential items.Chief executive Jo Whitfield said:The business had a challenging first quarter with cost of living pressure resulting in depressed consumer spending in discretionary categories.Unseasonal weather delayed a refresh of wardrobes for early spring creating a tough start to the season.The company’s quarterly earnings before tax and other costs nearly halved compared to the previous year, from £44m to £26m.Matalan said it was hit by the late onset of warmer summer weather - Yui Mok/PA Archive11:25 AM BSTS4 Capital shares plunge after profit warningShares in Sir Martin Sorrell’s digital advertising firm, S4 Capital, have tumbled after the firm warned over sales and profitability as technology clients slash their marketing spend.The group’s stock slumped by as much as 26pc in morning trading before settling around 18pc lower after the company said it now expects full-year like-for-like net revenue growth of between 2pc and 4pc, compared with an earlier forecast of 6pc to 10pc.It expects an underlying profit margin of between 14.5pc and 15.5pc, down from the 15pc to 16pc range guided for previously.S4 said the alert reflects the “challenging macroeconomic conditions and clients, especially those in the technology sector, remaining cautious and very focused on the short term”.11:07 AM BSTElon Musk rebrands Twitter with crowdsourced X logoElon Musk has begun rebranding Twitter as X using a new logo crowdsourced from one of his followers.Senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the details:The official Twitter account has been renamed X and its logo has been changed to a stylised picture of the letter.Mr Musk has also changed his logo on the website to the new icon and posted a video of it projected across the company’s headquarters.The changes come after the billionaire on Sunday vowed to scrap Twitter’s familiar bird icon and change the name to X.Mr Musk said: “Soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds”.Read how the new logo was chosen by Mr Musk after asking his followers on Twitter to suggest designs - and where it came from.The new X logo was projected on Twitter's headquarters - CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS10:50 AM BSTGas prices rise after Russia bombs Odesa portEuropean natural gas prices have increased amid potential risks to Russian supplies after the bombing of a Ukrainian port town.Benchmark futures rose as much as 4.6pc as traders monitored the escalation of tensions in Ukraine after Russia unleashed a fresh missile barrage against the Black Sea port of Odesa over the weekend.While Europe now only receives a small amount of its gas from Russia — including via pipelines through Ukraine — any supply disruption could tip the market balance.However, gas storage levels in Europe are higher than normal, more than 83pc full.Relatively muted gas demand in the industrial sector and steady flows from Norway following recent outages are adding to expectations that prices have more room to fall before the heating season boosts usage of the fuel.Dutch front-month gas, Europe’s benchmark, was last up 3.1pc to just over €29 a megawatt-hour.

Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said:July’s flash activity PMIs suggest that the resilience in activity eased further and domestic inflationary pressures continued to slow.That’s why we think interest rates will rise by 25 basis points in early August, from 5pc now to 5.25pc, rather than 50 basis points.Overall, given actual services CPI inflation remains high, we doubt the Bank of England will pause hiking rates just yet.What’s more, we think the Bank will need to keep rates high until the second half of next year in order to bring inflation down all the way to the 2pc target. 10:06 AM BSTRail commuters face more disruption amid fresh overtime banTrain drivers are to stage another overtime ban from August 7 to 12 in a long-running dispute over pay, the Aslef union has announced.The action, which will likely lead to disruption, will affect 15 train operators.They are: Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; Cross Country; East Midlands Railway; Greater Anglia; Great Western Railway; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; Island Line; LNER; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway main line; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains.Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary, said:We don’t want to take this action – because we don’t want people to be inconvenienced – but the train companies, and the government which stands behind them, have forced us into this place because they refuse to sit down and talk to us and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer to train drivers who have not had one for four years – since 2019 – while prices have soared in that time by more than 12%.09:51 AM BSTPound falls as private sector growth slowsThe pound has dropped 0.2pc after data on private sector growth came in weaker than expected.The S&amp;P Global flash purchasing managers index fell to 50.7 in July from 52.8 the month before, holding slightly above the 50 mark that indicates growth but dropping to its lowest level in six months.Sterling has been declining since inflation data last week indicated that increased interest rates may be beginning to slow down the economy.The pound is falling toward $1.28.

The services business activity index also fell in July, to 51.1. Although that was still above the 50 “no change” mark, the incoming new business PMI for the services sector declined to 48.5.He added: “At the national level, Germany’s Composite PMI fell from 50.6 in June to an eight-month low of 48.3. And France’s PMI dropped to just 46.6, suggesting that the outperformance of its economy could soon be over.”09:14 AM BST'Increased probability' of German recession, says economistThe eurozone data comes as Germany and France kicked off the third quarter with contractions in their private-sector economies.S&amp;P Global’s flash purchasing managers’ index for Germany dropped to the lowest level this year, with a July reading of 48.3 that fell below the 50 threshold that indicates growth.France fared even worse, hitting a 32-month low of 46.6.In Germany, the negative reading was driven by manufacturing, which has been below 50 for more than a year and is now near levels last seen at the start of the pandemic.In France, both manufacturing and services were in contraction again, though the former is in worse shape of the two.Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said of Germany:There is an increased probability that the economy will be in recession in the second half of the year.Over the last few months, we have seen a jaw dropping fall in both new orders and backlogs of work, which are now declining at their fastest rates since the initial Covid wave at the start of 2020.This doesn’t bode well for the rest of the year.The #German #economy moved into contraction territory in July as a deepening downturn in manufacturing output coincided with a sustained slowdown in services activity growth.

It is the lowest reading since November.The combination of low demand and strong inflation meant the economy failed to grow at the start of the year.Industry in particular has dragged down the euro-area’s economy with July’s 42.7 reading being the worst since the early months of the pandemic.Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:Manufacturing continues to be the Achilles heel of the euro zone.Producers have cut their output again at an accelerated pace in July, while the services sector’s activity is still expanding, though at a much slower rate than earlier in the year.Eurozone flash #PMI drops to 48.9 in July (June: 49.9) to signal the quickest fall in output for 8 months, while new orders and confidence data predict a potential worsening of the downturn.

A 2018 survey claimed that a fifth of manufacturers were planning to lay off workers as a result of Brexit.Manufacturing trade with the EU jumped last year thanks to a rise in exports from Scotland, which sold more oil and gas industry equipment during the energy crisis.Soaring oil and gas prices made some exploration projects that had been written off viable, prompting demand for equipment.The Northern Ireland Protocol, the 2019 deal which kept the region inside the EU’s single market, was also credited with boosting trade.The Make UK report said: “Northern Ireland enjoys a unique Dual Access position retaining access to the Single Market for goods and being able to trade goods freely into the rest of Great Britain, while in Scotland the oil and gas sector and its supply chains boosted exports to the EU during the ongoing Ukraine crisis.”5 things to start your day1) Britain facing years of stagnation because of high interest rates, Treasury model predicts | Hawkish rises will condemn economy to sluggish growth, EY Item Club says2) British Airways owner backs Teesside green jet fuel maker in net zero push | IAG will help the start-up establish the UK’s first commercial sustainable fuel factory3) BT challenger Cityfibre’s losses nearly double to £210m | Rising interest rates pile pressure on debt-fuelled broadband rollout4) Elon Musk vows to scrap Twitter’s logo | Replacing the signature blue bird suggests an ‘everything app’ rebranding is underway5) Russia’s economy is on the brink as Putin’s war chest empties | The country’s cash fortress is crumbling as oil profits plunge and the workforce flees conscriptionWhat happened overnightAsian shares braced for an action-packed week of earnings and central bank meetings that will likely see higher interest rates in Europe and the United States, and just possibly the end of the monetary tightening cycle in both.Markets are fully priced for quarter-point hikes from the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, so the focus will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde say about the future.The odd man out will be the Bank of Japan which meets on Friday and is thought likely to keep its super-loose policy intact, but some Western banks are speculating on a tweak to its yield curve control stance.Asian shares have advanced after Wall Street closed out another winning week, with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index adding 1.2pc to 32,696.65, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.4pc to 18,808.59.The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1pc higher to 3,170.30.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in S&amp;P Global (SPGI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SPGI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?S&amp;P Global's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at S&amp;P Global's main business drivers. Incorporated in December 1925, S&amp;P Global Inc. is a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.The company operates through six reportable segments: S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&amp;P Global Ratings (“Ratings""), S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&amp;P Global Mobility (“Mobility”), S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices”) and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions (“Engineering Solutions”).Ratings (27% of total revenues in 2022): Ratings operates as an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, providing investors and other market participants with information, ratings and benchmarks. With offices in more than 25 countries globally, Ratings holds an important position in the world's financial infrastructure. Ratings’ revenues are differentiated between transaction and non-transaction revenues.Market Intelligence (34%): It helps investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities to track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform evaluations and assess credit risk. Desktop, Data Management Solutions and Risk Services are the business lines included in the segment.Commodity Insights (15%): Commodity Insights provides information and benchmark prices for commodity and energy markets. It helps producers, traders, energy and commodity market intermediaries with price data, analytics and industry insights, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency in the market.Indices (12%): Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. Indices mainly derives revenues from asset-linked fees based on the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indices and also from subscription and transaction revenues.Mobility (10%) &amp; Engineering Solutions (3%) which were acquired as a result of the IHS Markit buyout, serves two different sections of customers. Mobility serves vehicle manufacturers, automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies while Engineering Solutions serves technical professionalsStory continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in S&amp;P Global ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $7,236.96, or a 623.70% gain, as of July 24, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 168.09% and the price of gold increased 42.91% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for SPGI too.S&amp;P Global remains well poised to gain from growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products. Effective management execution has helped it generate solid cash flow which is utilized for growth initiatives. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors confidence and positively impact earnings per share. Partly due to these positives, the stock has gained in the past year. However, S&amp;P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries with respect to the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines. Growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses. Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates that the company may have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 8.44%, and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the hedge fund manager’s portfolio, head directly to Tom Russo's Top 5 Holdings. Thomas A. Russo has been a partner at Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner, now Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn, since 1989 and became the managing member in 2014. Russo's stock selection approach considers value and price together, seeking companies with strong cash-flow characteristics and robust balance sheets. His investment philosophy centers on a few industries known for generating sustainable net free cash flow, such as food, beverage, tobacco, and advertising-supported media. He aims for an absolute return of 10% to 20% per year with minimal turnover. In its latest 13F filing for the first quarter of 2023, Russo’s hedge fund disclosed $9.6 billion in managed securities, with the top 10 holdings making up 80.64% of the portfolio. During a May 2023 interview with Markets Insider, Russo expressed deep concern over the US government's aggressive borrowing and the potential long-term impact on Americans. In January 2023, the US government surpassed its borrowing limit of $31.4 trillion, and if an agreement isn't reached to raise the debt ceiling, it could face a cash shortage by June. However, even if the deadlock is resolved, there will still be a significant amount of debt that future generations will have to deal with, according to Russo. The current banking turmoil is driven, in part, by rate hikes which are negatively affecting bond prices. This situation has elicited fears that nervous lenders might pull back, leading to a credit crunch. Nevertheless, Tom Russo argued that concerns about the economy collapsing and lending drying up might be exaggerated. He pointed out that there is an abundance of cash in the system, which has kept stock prices relatively high despite the prevailing headwinds. Additionally, there are asset-price bubbles in various industries that remain a cause for caution.Story continuesAs of the first quarter of 2023, Tom Russo's largest holding is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), where he owns 2,579 shares valued at $1.20 billion. At the end of February 2023, Tom Russo joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio, and the significance of compounding. In 1982, Russo was introduced to Warren Buffett, and at that time, Berkshire Hathaway shares were priced at around $5.00 to $7.00 per share. Since then, the compound return on the investment has been an impressive 19.5%, making it a rewarding wait, as per Russo. He noted that a key principle at Berkshire is to send money to Omaha, where Warren Buffett and other skilled investors can direct its use. Berkshire's subsidiary businesses excel in their respective fields, but they don't always need constant reinvestment. By centralizing the capital in Omaha, the experienced investors can decide how to deploy it best. This approach ensures a steady and strong pace of growth and prevents operating managers from making potential investment mistakes outside their core businesses. In a recent interview, Russo outlined that Warren Buffett's investment of over $11 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) over the past 15 months may be a strategic hedge against rising energy costs. With Berkshire Hathaway holding almost a 24% stake in Occidental, the increase in oil prices would lead to higher profits for Occidental, which could help offset rising fuel costs at Buffett's other major businesses like Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF Railway. Russo commended this approach, calling it a clever and unconventional investment, similar to Buffett's previous strategy of utilizing ""float"" from his insurance companies.Don't Miss: Viking Global's Performance, AUM, and Long-Term StocksSimilarly, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), where Russo owns a $899 million stake, announced on July 18 that it has partnered with payments processing company Geidea, which will utilize Mastercard's latest technology to implement BIN ranges, allowing consumers, merchants, and fintechs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to access advanced payment solutions. Starting from July 21, visitors and tourists also have the option to connect their Mastercard accounts with China's renowned mobile payment platforms. This integration enables them to conveniently book taxis, use the subway, and make purchases at numerous outlets across the cashless nation. This development represents a renewed initiative by Alipay and WeChat Pay to accommodate foreign credit cards, following their earlier limited access attempts in late 2019.Investors who seek guidance from popular Wall Street hedge fund managers can check out some of the best stocks in Tom Russo’s portfolio as of Q1 2023, which include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Our MethodologyTo compile our list of Tom Russo’s top 10 stocks, we used his hedge fund’s 13F filings for the first quarter of 2023.

Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that Tom Russo owned 1.06 million shares worth $368 million, representing 3.81% of the total 13F securities. On July 19, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q2 GAAP EPS of $3.29, beating Wall Street estimates by $0.44. However, the revenue of $8.19 billion fell short of market consensus by $100 million. The growth in revenue was fueled by a 6% rise in average paid membership, and there was an addition of 5.89 million global streaming paid memberships during the quarter, bringing the total to 238.39 million.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 108 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 117 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.26 million shares worth approximately $1.5 billion. In addition to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the top stock picks of Tom Russo. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Delivering performance through fundamental, bottom-up stock selection has been a constant over our tenure managing the Strategy. We underperformed in the first half of 2022 from being too early in entering several stocks going through negative earnings revisions and have seen relative results rebound over the last 12 months due to better stock picking, especially among earnings reset names such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn’s Stake Value: $506,886,095Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is involved in businesses such as insurance, freight rail transportation, and utilities worldwide. It is one of Tom Russo’s top stock picks. In the first quarter of 2023, Russo’s hedge fund owned 1.64 million shares worth $506.8 million, representing 5.25% of the total holdings. On July 10, Berkshire Hathaway Energy reached an agreement to purchase Dominion Energy's 50% ownership in the Cove Point LNG plant in Maryland for a total of $3.3 billion. After the deal is finalized, Berkshire Hathaway Energy will hold a 75% stake in the facility, while Brookfield Infrastructure Partners will retain a 25% interest.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 108 hedge funds were bullish on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 20 million shares worth $6 billion. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Berkshire Hathaway is our oldest position. We have held it for almost 11 years, and it has been our largest position for most of that time. We have told you so much about Berkshire through the years that it is difficult not to repeat ourselves.BRK is our core investment, and I would describe our view on the company this way: If I had to invest all my money in a single stock and could not touch it at all for 5–10 years, then I would choose BRK without any hesitation. It is a conglomerate consisting of individual investments the quality of which is well above average, with efficiency in capital allocation that is far above average, having an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, and with very low business risk.All this comes at a valuation that is significantly below the market average. BRK’s earnings power, the determination of which requires a thorough understanding of its business and a good bit of manual labor, is somewhere just north of USD 50 billion a year. Therefore, the entire company, with its market capitalisation of USD 590 billion, trades at less than 12 times annual earnings. It is very realistic to expect BRK’s stock price to grow at an average rate of about 10% per year over the long term…” (Click here to see the full text)8. Philip Morris International Inc.

(NYSE:PM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Finally, tobacco maker, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declined in the period on concerns related to supply-chain disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine, which we view as temporary. We believe the favorable economics and margin expansion associated with market share gains from the IQOS brand and Reduced Risk Products should yield value creation opportunities in the years ahead.

The estimate, however, is indicative of a 12.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.2 billion, suggesting a 12.3% jump from the year-ago level.Mastercard beat estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 4.9%. This is depicted in the graph below.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMastercard Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMastercard Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteBefore we get into what to expect in the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at MA’s previous-quarter performance.Q1 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading global payment solutions company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. This was primarily driven by improved cross-border travel coupled with an expanding payment network, and value-added services and solutions. However, the upside was partly offset by an escalating operating expense level.Now let’s see how things have shaped up before the second-quarter 2023 earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to NoteMastercard’s second-quarter revenues are likely to have benefited from increased travel and entertainment-related spending. MA’s GDV (the dollar volume of activity on Mastercard-branded cards during a particular period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis) is likely to have benefited from higher usage of its cards, both in the domestic and international markets, in the to-be-reported quarter.Our estimate for the company’s total GDV for all MA-branded programs is pegged at $2,126.2 billion, suggesting a 3.4% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. We expect GDV from domestic operations to have increased 4.6% year over year and almost 3% in international operations. Growing strength in Latin American operations is likely to have driven the metric.Story continuesProcessed transactions are likely to have witnessed a climb due to resilient consumer spending and increased contactless acceptance initiatives pursued by the technology company. Our estimate for the same indicates an increase of more than 14% from the year-ago period’s reading.Growing cross-border travel is expected to have favored cross-border volumes of Mastercard. Our estimate for cross-border assessments indicates a rise of almost 27% from a year ago. Further, our model predicts domestic assessments and transaction processing assessments to witness a 6.4% and 13.1% year-over-year increase, respectively.All the above-mentioned factors are likely to have boosted Mastercard’s results for the quarter under review, leading to significant growth from the year-ago levels. Yet, the company is expected to have incurred escalated costs, and higher rebates and incentives in the June quarter, affecting profit growth, making an earnings beat uncertain.Mastercard’s operating costs are likely to have significantly increased in the second quarter due to higher G&amp;A, advertising, marketing and data processing costs, thereby hurting bottom-line growth. We expect total adjusted operating expenses to increase nearly 13% from the prior-year quarter’s actuals.Furthermore, our estimate for payments network rebates and incentives suggests a more than 18% year-over-year increase. Also, due to the high interest rate environment, the company’s interest expense figure is likely to have jumped around 30% from the prior-year period.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mastercard this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Mastercard has an Earnings ESP of -1.81%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.82 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Mastercard, here are some stocks from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around.S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI has an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S&amp;P Global’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.12 per share, indicating 11% year-over-year growth.

BAH beat estimates in all the past four quarters, the average being 10.2%.Flywire Corporation FLYW has an Earnings ESP of +6.67% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flywire’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 31.8% improvement from the year-ago period.

The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Is QUALCOMM Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, QUALCOMM seems to be fairly priced at around 9.7% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy QUALCOMM today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $137.48, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because QUALCOMM’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will QUALCOMM generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -17% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for QUALCOMM. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? QCOM seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on QCOM should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you want to dive deeper into QUALCOMM, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

information about our debt-to-capital ratios. These measures could be considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC's rules and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, comparable GAAP financial measures. We calculate total net debt by subtracting total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash from notes payable to present the amount of assets needed to satisfy the debt. We use the debt-to-capital and net debt-to-capital ratios as indicators of our overall leverage and believe they are useful financial measures in understanding the leverage employed in our operations. We believe that these measures provide investors relevant and useful information for evaluating the comparability of financial information presented and comparing our profitability and liquidity to other companies in the homebuilding industry. Although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information, the methods used may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate these measures and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to those of such other companies.The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the debt-to-capital ratios ($000's omitted):Debt-to-Capital RatiosJune 30,2023December 31,2022Notes payable$2,033,192$2,045,527Shareholders' equity9,705,0258,914,098Total capital$11,738,217$10,959,625Debt-to-capital ratio17.3%18.7%Notes payable$2,033,192$2,045,527Less: Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(1,777,780)(1,094,553)Total net debt$255,412$950,974Shareholders' equity9,705,0258,914,098Total net capital$9,960,437$9,865,072Net debt-to-capital ratio2.6%9.6%View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230725177858/en/ContactsInvestors: Jim Zeumer(404) 978-6434jim.zeumer@pultegroup.com]"
169,6d973fac-e1cc-3396-bd9e-cc2f5dc0c357,PHM,2023-07-25,PulteGroup (PHM) Home Sales to Grow Sequentially in Q2 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-home-sales-grow-151700476.html,1690211820,STORY,"['PHM', 'DHI', 'KBH']","[PulteGroup, Inc.’s PHM Homebuilding segment, accounting for more than 98% of total revenues, is expected to have marginally declined year over year. However, it is likely to grow sequentially when PHM reports second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 25.PulteGroup has exhibited a solid performance so far this year, with the stock rising 71.5%, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 49.3% increase. It has been benefiting from its focus on entry-level buyers and liquidity protection, prudent management of cash flows and land investment strategy. However, accelerating mortgage rates pose a concern.Click here to know how the company’s overall second-quarter performance is expected to be.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA Look at Q2 Segmental PerformancePulteGroup’s Homebuilding segment is expected to have reflected the impact of accelerating mortgage rates on a year-over-year basis. Nonetheless, the shortage of existing homes for sale in the market has been driving demand for new homes. The home sales segment is expected to have registered growth sequentially, courtesy of higher deliveries. Also, a prudent land investment strategy and focus on entry-level buyers are expected to have benefited PulteGroup in the second quarter.Our model predicts Homebuilding revenues to increase sequentially to $3.79 billion in the second quarter from $3.52 billion in the first quarter of 2023 but a decrease from $3.8 billion a year ago. Within the Homebuilding umbrella, we expect home sales to be $3.78 billion, reflecting a 0.2% year-over-year decline but an increase of 7.7% sequentially. Land sales are expected to decline 3.4% year over year to $32.7 million in the second quarter but increase 8.7% sequentially.PulteGroup expects home deliveries to be within 7,000-7,400 homes versus 7,177 homes delivered a year ago. Our model predicts deliveries to decline 2.1% year over year but increase 9.9% sequentially to 7,026 units. The decrease reflects a tough year-over-year comparison, given rising mortgage rates.PHM expects an average selling price or ASP for the quarter in the range of $525,000-$535,000 compared with the year-ago level of $531,000. Our model predicts the ASP of homes delivered to inch up 0.7% year over year to $534,600 but decline 1.9% sequentially.Also, the labor market tightened with the limited availability of labor, arresting the rapid growth in housing production. Labor shortages are leading to higher wages, thereby putting pressure on the margins.From the margin perspective, the company expects home sale gross margins to contract in the range of 27.5%-28% for second-quarter 2023 from 31.3% reported in the year-ago period. Although construction costs remain elevated otherwise, the gross margin of the quarter is likely to have reflected the benefits of lower lumber costs that are flowing through PHM’s operations. Our model predicts homebuilding gross margins to be 27.8% for the quarter, down from the year-ago period as well as sequentially.PulteGroup anticipates SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) to be in the range of 9-9.5% versus 9.2% in the prior-year quarter. Our model predicts SG&amp;A expenses to be 9.5% of home sales revenues for the quarter, up from the year-ago level but down sequentially.Meanwhile, we expect the company’s new orders to increase 9.4% year over year to 7,019 units in the quarter. Backlog is expected to decline 31.6% year over year to 13,122 units.Story continuesOverall Q2 Earnings &amp; Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is currently pegged at $2.47 per share, indicating a 9.5% decline from the year-ago figure of $2.73. Also, the consensus mark for revenues is $3.96 billion, suggesting 0.8% year-over-year growth.PulteGroup, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, surpassed earnings estimates in 23 of the trailing 26 quarters. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A Few Recent Construction ReleasesD.R. Horton, Inc. DHI reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023) results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.On a year-over-year basis, although DHI’s earnings declined, revenues increased. Notably, the company highlighted that the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited, and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. This tailwind has helped this Arlington, TX-based homebuilder to witness net sales order growth of 37% year over year in the fiscal third quarter.KB Home KBH reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended May 31, 2023). Both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s earnings and revenues surpassed the consensus mark in two consecutive quarters.KBH’s net orders grew 1% in the quarter to 3,936 units from the prior year. The value of net orders, however, was down 11% from the year-ago quarter to $1.9 billion due to lower ASP. Sequentially, net orders grew 84% in units and 90% in value, respectively.Acuity Brands, Inc. AYI reported mixed results for third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended May 31, 2023), wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Earnings beat the consensus mark for the 13th consecutive quarter. Revenues missed the same for three quarters in a row following six straight quarters of beat.Along with the earnings, AYI announced the completion of the acquisition of KE2 Therm. This will enable it to expand its Distech Brand by entering the commercial refrigeration control space.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Meritage Homes (MTH). MTH is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 8.59, which compares to its industry's average of 10.36. Over the last 12 months, MTH's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.60 and as low as 3.20, with a median of 7.57.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MTH's P/B ratio of 1.24. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.45. Within the past 52 weeks, MTH's P/B has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.66, with a median of 0.95.Finally, our model also underscores that MTH has a P/CF ratio of 5.51. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.68. Over the past year, MTH's P/CF has been as high as 5.84 and as low as 2.47, with a median of 3.67.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind PulteGroup (PHM), an Building Products - Home Builders stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of PulteGroup are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 8.36 and a PEG ratio of 0.52 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 10.36 and 0.82, respectively.PHM's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 8.99 and as low as 3.66, with a median of 7.22, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 4.10 and as low as 0.44, with a median of 0.53, all within the past year.Furthermore, PulteGroup holds a P/B ratio of 1.87 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 1.45. PHM's P/B has been as high as 1.99, as low as 1.02, with a median of 1.33 over the past 12 months.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Meritage Homes and PulteGroup's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that MTH and PHM is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PHM, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PulteGroup is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PHM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.48 per share for PHM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PHM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.29% heading into earnings season.PulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PHM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for PulteGroup, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.As the Federal Reserve approaches the end of its rate-hiking cycle, investors are reconsidering shares of dividend-rich companies. The Fed's aggressive rate increases have lifted short-term Treasury yields above 5%, providing income-seeking investors with more options after a decade of historically low rates. This has affected popular dividend-paying stocks, which were favored during lower-rate periods. With the expectation that the Fed will not raise rates significantly further, dividend payers are becoming appealing again, especially if Treasury yields decline. According to Reuters, some investors are shifting their focus to financial and energy stocks, anticipating an economic soft landing rather than a painful recession. A resurgence of interest in dividend-paying stocks is evident in inflows to the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which tracks companies with a consistent history of increasing dividends. However, S&amp;P 500 companies have been less generous to investors this year, with lower oil prices leading some energy companies to cut back on payouts. Despite this, investors seek out dividend-paying stocks as a source of total return, betting on potential faltering bond yields while stocks continue to perform well. Additionally, the appeal of dividend payers is attributed to a broadening of the market rally from tech and growth stocks into other sectors, such as energy and financials.On the real estate front, the market is grappling with challenges in both residential and commercial segments, primarily influenced by higher interest rates. Despite this shared obstacle, distinct factors are driving residential and commercial real estate prices differently. Residential real estate has experienced a remarkable surge, with median home prices in the U.S. rising by 50.7% in 2.5 years to a record high of $413,800 in June 2022. Although home prices slightly pulled back to just over $396,000 in May 2023, there are concerns about low inventory, reluctance to switch to higher-rate mortgages, declining affordability, and tighter credit availability affecting the market. On the other hand, the commercial real estate market faces challenges due to the pandemic's impact, leading to high office vacancy rates in major cities. According to Wells Fargo Advisors, small businesses relying on downtown foot traffic are suffering, and new lease rates are declining in many markets. Consequently, the commercial real estate sector's outlook remains unfavorable, with expectations of further deterioration in the near-to-intermediate term, warranting caution for investors and stakeholders.Story continuesOil prices have been holding steady near a three-month high, largely driven by positive signals from China's efforts to bolster its economic growth and the continued tightening of the global crude market. China, as the world's largest crude oil importer, plays a crucial role in influencing oil prices, and recent indications from the country's top leaders have provided support to the market. One contributing factor to the bullish outlook for oil prices is the US crude's notable achievement of closing above its 200-day average. This technical milestone has added to the positive sentiment among investors and analysts, signaling potential further upside in the oil market. Specifically, Brent crude futures have been maintaining a price above $82 a barrel in the London market, reflecting a substantial 4% gain over the last three trading sessions. Such upward momentum suggests growing confidence among traders in the short-term prospects for oil prices.China's commitment to supporting its real estate sector and boosting consumption is another significant development influencing the oil market. The country's leaders have demonstrated their intention to provide support to the property market without resorting to major fiscal or monetary loosening measures. This approach is likely aimed at maintaining stability while addressing key economic challenges and supporting sustainable growth. The combination of China's supportive measures and the ongoing tightening of the global crude market is contributing to the overall stability and optimism in the oil market. Investors and industry experts are closely monitoring these developments as they shape the trajectory of oil prices in the near future. The steady performance near a three-month high and the recent bullish sentiment provide some reassurance to market participants and may encourage further investment in the oil sector. However, uncertainties persist, and geopolitical factors and supply-demand dynamics will continue to play a crucial role in determining the future trajectory of oil prices.On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on tech stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with healthcare stock Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 10 Stockssource: pixabay10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Upside Potential: N/AIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) holds the title of the world's leading chip manufacturer. However, the company has recently faced challenges in maintaining its technological advantage. Many experts are closely monitoring Intel's decision to adopt a new approach of allowing other companies to use its manufacturing plants and actively pursuing new technologies. The outcome of this strategy is eagerly awaited to determine if it will bring positive outcomes for the company.On July 24, Mizuho analyst Rakesh raised the price target for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) from $30 to $33. This adjustment comes as Rakesh cites an overall improvement in the semiconductor sector's price-earnings multiple, indicating a positive trend in the industry. Rakesh's rationale for the price target increase includes the potential for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to benefit from the ongoing AI (Artificial Intelligence) revolution. While he believes that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) could generate some additional revenue from this technological wave, he also notes that the company's growth may be more subdued compared to its competitors in the semiconductor market. The revised price target of $33 suggests that Mizuho sees potential for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock to appreciate further in the future, based on its assessment of the company's performance and its position within the semiconductor industry.09. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Upside Potential: 2%Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that is known for developing medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods. On July 24, Barclays raised the price target for Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to $175 per share, up from the previous target of $171. This upward revision in the price target indicates Barclays' positive outlook on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock and its potential for further growth. The new price target of $175 reflects Barclays' belief that Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares have the potential to reach that level in the future, signaling their confidence in the company's fundamentals and future performance.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The tech-dominated quarter was a headwind for both defensive and cyclical sectors, with shares of health care holdings such as UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Elevance (ELV) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) declining after a strong 2022.”08. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Upside Potential: 8%Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a travel services company that provides lodging options to travelers who are not interested in staying at hotels. It is one of the more popular companies and one that has disrupted the real estate sector. It enables property owners to temporarily rent out their properties to travelers and other users. The firm was set up in 2007 and is based in San Francisco, California. On July 24, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson significantly increased the projected price target for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) shares, raising it from $135 to $160. The basis for this optimistic adjustment lies in the observed resurgence of travel expenditures, indicating a reacceleration in the travel industry. As a result of their analysis and confidence in the company's potential, KeyBanc maintained an overweight or buy rating on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock. This update from KeyBanc demonstrates a strong belief in Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) growth prospects, indicating that the company is poised to benefit from the rebounding travel sector.07. Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR)Upside Potential: 12%On July 24, Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) received a favorable review from analyst Chase Mulvehill, who is associated with BofA Securities. In his recent assessment of Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR), Mulvehill reaffirmed his positive stance on the company by maintaining a Buy rating on its stock. Furthermore, he made an upward revision to the price target, raising it from $38 to $40. This suggests that he expects the stock to perform even better in the future and has confidence in its potential to provide attractive returns to investors. Mulvehill's positive review and price target increase highlight his belief in Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) growth prospects and ability to navigate its industry's challenges and opportunities.ClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We established a new position in Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR), in the energy sector, which provides technological support and services to energy and industrial companies including oilfield services, oilfield equipment, turbomachinery and process solutions and digital solutions. We believe management’s focus on capital discipline has helped streamline their strategic focus and placed greater emphasis on improving cash generation and returns. Additionally, Baker Hughes’ overwhelming market share in the gas turbine and compression business creates a long-term growth runway due to the global buildout of renewable energy projects and rising liquefied natural gas capital expenditures.”06. Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ)Upside Potential: 12%Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is a multinational pizza company that operates through three segments – U.S. Stores, International Franchises, and Supply Chain. On July 24, Citi raised the price target for Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) to $431 per share, up from the previous target of $405. This upward adjustment in the price target suggests that Citi analysts anticipate Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) stock to experience further growth and have a positive outlook on the company's performance. The new price target of $431 indicates the level at which Citi analysts believe the stock could reach in the future, reflecting their confidence in the company's fundamentals and potential for future earnings growth. This increase in the price target could be an indicator of Citi's belief in Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) ability to capitalize on opportunities, outperform its competitors, and deliver value to its investors.LRT Capital made the following comment about Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:10 Best Sporting Goods Stocks To Buy Now12 Cheap Travel Stocks to Buy Now10 Oversold Energy Stocks You Can BuyDisclosure.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out the 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.In the first half of 2023, global economic growth picked up pace, reaching 2.8%. Up to this point, the impact of monetary tightening was balanced by the diminishing supply shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, since 2022, the surge in global policy rates by approximately 400 basis points (bps) has begun to affect interest-sensitive spending and impede factory output. Despite the current momentum, the fading resiliency of the global economy suggests that growth moderation is likely unavoidable. Speaking of the United States specifically, J.P. Morgan Research expects the country to undergo a mild recession towards the end of 2023. This prediction comes from the Federal Reserve's adoption of a restrictive policy stance, which is expected to lead to tighter credit conditions, consequently dragging down the economy.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan., stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to economists at Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25% from their previous projection of 35%, which was made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Research projects a robust annual average growth of 1.8% for this year, surpassing the consensus among private-sector economists and the projections made by the Federal Reserve.Story continuesIn the realm of investing, volatility holds significant importance. It becomes evident to investors during market downturns when certain individual stocks, characterized by higher volatility, undergo substantial price fluctuations. Additionally, it serves as a proxy for risk; higher volatility often implies a riskier portfolio. As an example, certain sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are known for being less volatile than others, making them potentially safer investment options during times of recession. Business Insider's report indicated that the consumer staples industry had outperformed the overall market by an impressive 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015, with much of this outperformance observed during recessionary periods. Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average experienced only a marginal decline of 1.4% in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 faced a substantial 19.4% decrease during the same period.See also: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowAs the first half of this year came to a close, the market received a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report. This has led some to question the need for acquiring the safer holdings as the overall market sentiment remains strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors. Although investors may be inclined to favor riskier securities with higher potential returns in such a market environment, it is important to realize that the market can shift and turn at any moment. In that regard, low volatility stocks serve as safe harbors for investors who are averse to turbulent market swings. Their comparatively steady performance not only aids in minimizing losses during downturns but also prevents hasty panic selling that could jeopardize one's retirement savings. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some low volatility stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), among others listed below.12 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected the following low risk stocks suitable based on optimistic analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The betas for these firms were below 1.0 as of July 19, which means these stocks are less risky as compared to the broader market. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.12. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Beta Value: 0.62Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a prominent American corporation renowned as one of the largest producers and marketers of tobacco, cigarettes, and related products worldwide. Its global operations are based in Henrico County, Virginia. With an impressive 54-year streak of dividend increases, few companies are as experienced as Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) in effectively navigating market downturns.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were long Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) at the end of the first quarter of 2023, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Natixis Global Asset Management's Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 6.33 million shares worth $282.77 million.Much like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a smart low volatility stock that investors should take note of.11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Beta Value: 0.35Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), commonly known as Verizon, is an American multinational telecommunication conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the first quarter of 2023, the telecommunications firm reported an increase of 633,000 subscribers.On June 1, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 1, to shareholders of record on July 10.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Billionaire Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $188.5 million.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Beta Value: 0.54Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a major American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. The company is a global leader in the beverage industry, and is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $77 to $74 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Although the analyst perceives KO as a stronger defensive stock during inflationary periods compared to its historical performance, he expresses near-term apprehension concerning the ongoing tax litigation.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”9. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.64McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 46 years.

The revenue exhibited a notable 4% year-over-year growth, exceeding the consensus revenue forecast by over $300 million, while the adjusted EPS expanded from $2.28 to $2.63.At the end of Q1 2023, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), up from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $4 billion. With over 1.64 million shares, Paul Marshall And Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was the company’s leading stakeholder.8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Beta Value: 0.35Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, the company is renowned developing and manufacturing medicines and vaccines spanning various fields, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. Notably, in 2022, Pfizer's top-performing product was the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, which generated an impressive $37.8 billion in alliance revenues and direct sales.The biotech company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 13 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.50%, as of July 19.At the end of March 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), worth collectively roughly $2.2 billion. Of these, Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest shareholder, with total stakes worth approximately $380.28 million.7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.54AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) operates as a specialized biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of drugs designed to address chronic and complex diseases. The company is best known for manufacturing its blockbuster drug Humira — a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.With a record of 50 years of continuous dividend growth, the American pharmaceutical company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with yield of 4.30% as of July 19.As of the close of Q1 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q1.Harding Loevner mentioned AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.41The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On June 11, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is a low volatility stock that hedge funds are piling into.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.Suggested articles:12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $2510 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $1010 Best One Dollar Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this world's biggest maker of health care products a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Johnson &amp; Johnson is 5.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 5.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 2.4%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Johnson &amp; Johnson has an S/TA ratio of 0.53, which means that the company gets $0.53 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.47, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Johnson &amp; Johnson looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 4.2% this year versus the industry average of 1.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Johnson &amp; Johnson have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.8% over the past month.Bottom LineJohnson &amp; Johnson has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Johnson &amp; Johnson well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

179,1c546358-e4b3-3dc1-8e96-ad3cc5c9e3ed,JNJ,2023-07-25,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154505893.html,1690213505,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Johnson &amp; Johnson in FocusHeadquartered in New Brunswick, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of -3.66% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.19 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.8%. In comparison, the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield is 2.67%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.59%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.76 is up 7% from last year. In the past five-year period, Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.85%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Johnson &amp; Johnson's current payout ratio is 46%. This means it paid out 46% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.JNJ is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $10.70 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.42%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that JNJ is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CCI 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CCIPeter Lynch Chart of CCIThe GF Value of a stock is an estimation of its intrinsic worth, calculated based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor from GuruFocus considering past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. If a stock's price significantly exceeds the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, indicating poor future returns. Conversely, if it is substantially below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Based on this analysis, Crown Castle's current price and market cap suggest it could be a potential value trap.One contributing factor to this classification is Crown Castle's Altman Z-score of 0.82. This score, which falls in the distressed zone, suggests a higher risk of bankruptcy. A safer financial condition would be indicated by an Altman Z-score above 2.99.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis waste management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.8%.Revenues are expected to be $3.7 billion, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Republic Services?For Republic Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Republic Services will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Republic Services would post earnings of $1.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.24, delivering a surprise of +9.73%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Republic Services appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, GFL Environmental Inc. (GFL) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.47 billion, up 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for GFL Environmental Inc. has been revised 11.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 25.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that GFL Environmental Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund advanced 9.22% (Institutional Shares) in the quarter compared to a 3.44% gain for the Russell 3000 Health Care Index (benchmark) and an 8.74% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Since its inception, on April 30, 2018, the fund gained 13.58% on an annualized basis, compared to the benchmark’s 10.85% gain and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 12.54% return. Favorable stock selection led the fund to outperform in the quarter. Investments in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare equipment accounted for most of the relative gains of the fund in the quarter. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.Baron Health Care Fund highlighted stocks like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Rahway, New Jersey, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a healthcare company that operates through Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. On July 24, 2023, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stock closed at $108.79 per share.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.""Story continuesanimal, breed, canine, care, check, checkup, clinic, control, diagnostic, doctor, dog, domestic, ear, exam, examination, examining, expertise, female, girl, golden, happy,Syda Productions/Shutterstock.comMerck &amp; Co., Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out the 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.In the first half of 2023, global economic growth picked up pace, reaching 2.8%. Up to this point, the impact of monetary tightening was balanced by the diminishing supply shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, since 2022, the surge in global policy rates by approximately 400 basis points (bps) has begun to affect interest-sensitive spending and impede factory output. Despite the current momentum, the fading resiliency of the global economy suggests that growth moderation is likely unavoidable. Speaking of the United States specifically, J.P. Morgan Research expects the country to undergo a mild recession towards the end of 2023. This prediction comes from the Federal Reserve's adoption of a restrictive policy stance, which is expected to lead to tighter credit conditions, consequently dragging down the economy.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan., stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to economists at Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25% from their previous projection of 35%, which was made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Research projects a robust annual average growth of 1.8% for this year, surpassing the consensus among private-sector economists and the projections made by the Federal Reserve.Story continuesIn the realm of investing, volatility holds significant importance. It becomes evident to investors during market downturns when certain individual stocks, characterized by higher volatility, undergo substantial price fluctuations. Additionally, it serves as a proxy for risk; higher volatility often implies a riskier portfolio. As an example, certain sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are known for being less volatile than others, making them potentially safer investment options during times of recession. Business Insider's report indicated that the consumer staples industry had outperformed the overall market by an impressive 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015, with much of this outperformance observed during recessionary periods. Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average experienced only a marginal decline of 1.4% in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 faced a substantial 19.4% decrease during the same period.See also: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowAs the first half of this year came to a close, the market received a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report. This has led some to question the need for acquiring the safer holdings as the overall market sentiment remains strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors. Although investors may be inclined to favor riskier securities with higher potential returns in such a market environment, it is important to realize that the market can shift and turn at any moment. In that regard, low volatility stocks serve as safe harbors for investors who are averse to turbulent market swings. Their comparatively steady performance not only aids in minimizing losses during downturns but also prevents hasty panic selling that could jeopardize one's retirement savings. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some low volatility stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), among others listed below.12 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected the following low risk stocks suitable based on optimistic analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The betas for these firms were below 1.0 as of July 19, which means these stocks are less risky as compared to the broader market. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.12. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Beta Value: 0.62Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a prominent American corporation renowned as one of the largest producers and marketers of tobacco, cigarettes, and related products worldwide. Its global operations are based in Henrico County, Virginia. With an impressive 54-year streak of dividend increases, few companies are as experienced as Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) in effectively navigating market downturns.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were long Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) at the end of the first quarter of 2023, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Natixis Global Asset Management's Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 6.33 million shares worth $282.77 million.Much like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a smart low volatility stock that investors should take note of.11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Beta Value: 0.35Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), commonly known as Verizon, is an American multinational telecommunication conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the first quarter of 2023, the telecommunications firm reported an increase of 633,000 subscribers.On June 1, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 1, to shareholders of record on July 10.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Billionaire Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $188.5 million.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Beta Value: 0.54Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a major American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. The company is a global leader in the beverage industry, and is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $77 to $74 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Although the analyst perceives KO as a stronger defensive stock during inflationary periods compared to its historical performance, he expresses near-term apprehension concerning the ongoing tax litigation.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”9. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.64McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 46 years.

These stakes are collectively worth over $4 billion. With over 1.64 million shares, Paul Marshall And Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was the company’s leading stakeholder.8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Beta Value: 0.35Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, the company is renowned developing and manufacturing medicines and vaccines spanning various fields, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. Notably, in 2022, Pfizer's top-performing product was the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, which generated an impressive $37.8 billion in alliance revenues and direct sales.The biotech company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 13 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.50%, as of July 19.At the end of March 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), worth collectively roughly $2.2 billion. Of these, Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest shareholder, with total stakes worth approximately $380.28 million.7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.54AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) operates as a specialized biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of drugs designed to address chronic and complex diseases. The company is best known for manufacturing its blockbuster drug Humira — a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.With a record of 50 years of continuous dividend growth, the American pharmaceutical company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with yield of 4.30% as of July 19.As of the close of Q1 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q1.Harding Loevner mentioned AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.41The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On June 11, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The company has consistently raised its dividends for 67 years. During fiscal Q3 2023, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) recorded a 3.5% year-over-year growth in revenue, amounting to $20.07 billion. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on the Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is a low volatility stock that hedge funds are piling into.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.Suggested articles:12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $2510 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $1010 Best One Dollar Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

Operations fully resumed on July 5.Analysts said they will seek answers about whether the agreement, which boosts wages by at least 23.5% over four years, could also result in raised prices for Boeing.""What (the strike at) Spirit actually told us is what's happened to the cost of skilled touch labor - which is that it has just gone through the roof,"" said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners.Aircraft producers are typically able to shield themselves from inflation through contractual escalation clauses that pass rising costs to airlines. However, those clauses have ceilings, and Spirit -- which expects to burn cash in 2023 -- may not be financially capable of absorbing higher labor costs, said AeroDynamic Advisories analyst Richard Aboulafia.""What are you going to do, say, 'You'll have to cut your profit margins?' They don't have profit margins,"" Aboulafia said.Investors will also seek details about whether the two-week work stoppage delayed production of Boeing's bestselling 737. Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein wrote in a July 12 note that 13% of the 49 narrowbody 737s delivered in June came from Boeing's inventory compared to 5% in April and May - potentially signifying a slowdown of fuselages from Spirit.Problems at Spirit have rattled Boeing's aircraft production and deliveries several times in 2023.A data analysis error by the aerostructures manufacturer forced Boeing to halt deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner for several weeks earlier this year, and Boeing continues to rework 737 narrowbody planes where Spirit incorrectly installed two brackets.Story continuesBoeing's defense business will also come under the microscope after the indefinitely delayed the first crewed launch of its Starliner spacecraft in June.Boeing Defense CEO Ted Colbert told reporters later that month that performance of the company's defense unit will look similar to the first quarter, when margins at the company were negative due in part to a charge on the KC-46 program.""It's just another quarter where things should have got better by now, but they haven't,"" Cunningham said.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Washington; Editing by Nick Zieminski)]"

The aerospace giant delivered 136 787 Dreamliner jets in the second quarter of 2023 compared with 121 jets in the year-ago period, following this product line’s delivery resumption in the third quarter of 2022.Such significant delivery figures caused a 12.4% surge in the company’s overall commercial deliveries. This, in turn, might have boosted Boeing Commercial Airplane (BCA) segment’s revenues in the quarter to be reported.The top-line estimate for Boeing’s commercial business segment is pegged at $6,788 million, implying a solid 9.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Earnings ExpectationsImprovements in BCA's financial performance, owing to increasing 787 deliveries and consistent cost management efforts by the BCA team, are likely to have contributed to this unit’s second-quarter bottom-line growth.Moreover, the company has been steadily increasing production rates for its key commercial programs to meet the robust demand. This, in turn, might have bolstered its production efficiency thereby aiding the segment’s overall bottom-line performance.However, margin performance for the BCA unit is projected to be a little volatile in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, with the company steadily liquidating the 737 and 787 inventory levels as well as shutting down the storage facilities. This, along with consistent abnormal costs related to the 787 as well as 777X jets programs, is likely to have had adversely impacted earnings for the BCA segment. Story continuesFurther, higher research and development expenses projected for this unit, as predicted by our model, indicate a 7.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s level. This might have hurt BCA’s earnings.The second-quarter earnings estimate for BA’s commercial business segment is pegged at a loss of $350 million, indicating a deterioration from the year-ago quarter’s reported loss of $242 million.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around.

Price and EPS SurpriseTE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseTE Connectivity Ltd. price-eps-surprise | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteKey Factors to NoteThe solid execution of TE Connectivity’s strategies, especially price increases and content outperformance through electric vehicles (EV), is expected to have been the key catalysts in the fiscal third quarter.TEL’s global manufacturing strategy is anticipated to have benefited its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Organic growth in the Energy segment, driven by a broad renewable applications portfolio, wind or solar, is expected to continue. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is likely to have expanded expected margins sequentially for the Industrial segment.All these factors are anticipated to have impacted the Industrial segment in the quarter under review. Our model estimate for industrial solutions sales is pegged at $1.17 billion, implying growth of 3.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.A strong global position in the EV market, subjected to design wins and high voltage connectivity products, is likely to reflect positively in the Transportation segment. Increased stability in supply chain transportation is expected to have exponentially increased the growth of orders. Pricing actions implemented to offset inflationary impacts are likely to have driven margin expansion in the segment.However, sluggishness in sensor and commercial transportation businesses is expected to have impacted the segment negatively. Also, the weakening momentum in China is likely to have been a concern.Our model estimate for Transportation segment sales is pegged at $2.28 billion, suggesting a 0.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Coming to the Communication segment, market weakness and inventory corrections are expected to have impacted both the appliance and data and devices market negatively.Our model estimate for Communication segment sales is pegged at $552.7 million, indicating a decline of 16.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for TE Connectivity basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for TE Connectivity imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for TE ConnectivityThis electronics maker is expected to earn $6.57 per share for the fiscal year ending September 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.4%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for TE Connectivity. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of TE Connectivity to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

201,5d58d185-dd50-30a8-b717-6918558c7b62,NKE,2023-07-25,Adidas and Puma bet on 'terrace' sneaker trend in tough market,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adidas-puma-bet-terrace-sneaker-060450092.html,1690265090,STORY,"['ADS.DE', 'PUM.F', 'NKE']","[By Helen Reid and Linda PasquiniLONDON (Reuters) - The trend for low-rise rubber-soled ""terrace"" sneakers could give Adidas and Puma an advantage over Nike this summer, but may not offset weakening U.S. and Chinese demand.German sportswear giants Adidas and Puma have trawled their archives to re-release old styles in new colours, driving renewed interest in the shoes from the 1970s and 1980s named after the standing section at soccer stadiums.The number of searches for ""Adidas Samba"", one of the brand's main terrace styles, has surged worldwide over the past year and hit a peak in mid-June, Google Trends data shows.Puma is likely to benefit less from the trend than Adidas because its terrace range doesn't have as much name recognition, said Adam Cochrane, analyst at Deutsche Bank. But it's certainly an area where the brand can compete.""If there's a loser from this it's Nike, which doesn't have the track record from the 80s so you don't have the historic shoes to fall back on and the back catalogue to revisit,"" he said. Nike is more known for chunky basketball shoes, like the hugely successful Jordan range.Still, while terrace shoe sales are growing, they're a small fraction of the overall business. Investors will be pushing Puma and Adidas on broader strategies to navigate weak consumer demand at second-quarter results on July 26 and Aug. 3 respectively.""We believe the U.S. market is now (following on from China) at the heart of the worries for investors in Adidas and Puma,"" said Robert Schramm-Fuchs, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, which holds shares in Adidas.Nike last month reported its slowest sales growth in four quarters in North America, its biggest market, highlighting a weaker than expected U.S. consumer. Weak GDP figures from China last week also raised alarm about the world's second-biggest economy.Adidas, however, has got a big boost from selling some of its stock of discontinued Yeezy shoes. On Monday it slashed its expected 2023 operating loss to 450 million euros from 700 million euros, citing unexpectedly strong Yeezy sales.Story continuesAdidas, led by ex-Puma CEO Bjorn Gulden since the start of the year, said in May it would donate proceeds from Yeezy stock sales to non-governmental organisations including the Anti-Defamation League but has not yet said what share of the proceeds will go to NGOs.Puma, whose shares have lagged Nike and Adidas over the past year, should update investors on strategy as the brand aims to up its game in performance sportswear after what some saw as an over-emphasis on lifestyle.Sportswear has the potential to grow further with a ""casualisation"" of fashion and consumers' increased focus on health and fitness, said Edouard Aubin, analyst at Morgan Stanley.""However, the cost to compete for sportswear brands is very high, and barriers to entry are low, making retailers quite vulnerable to 'boom and bust' cycles as trends change,"" said Aubin.($1 = 0.9028 euros)(Reporting by Helen Reid in London and Linda Pasquini in Gdansk; Editing by Susan Fenton)]"

This is disappointing, especially as many of the biggest under-performers are stocks that have traditionally been long-term winners for investors.And yet, many previously reliable blue-chips are lagging the expanded market. For them, poor performance is due to significant, often structural, problems that have no quick fixes. Investors would be best advised to sell these securities. Here are three blue-chip stocks to part ways with as soon as possible (ASAP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNike (NKE)A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.comAt the end of June, Nike (NYSE:NKE) reported its first earnings miss in three years due to stagnant inventories and reduced profit margins. This was not the news analysts and investors were hoping for, and it further depressed the price of NKE stock.Consequently, shares of the Dow component are now down nearly 10% on the year, with no rebound in sight. The stock fell 3% immediately after NKE reported earnings of 66 cents per share versus the 67 cents that was the consensus expectation on Wall Street.And yet, latest quarter revenue beat expectations, coming in at $12.83 billion compared to $12.59 billion that was forecast by analysts. However, Nike said that its gross margins fell 1.4 percentage points to 43.6% during the latest quarter. In addition, the company offered weak forward guidance, expecting revenue to grow only by mid-single digits for fiscal 2024. Analysts had expected year-over-year growth of 6.3%, according to Refinitiv data.Nike added that its inventory value came in at $8.5 billion at the end of its most recent fiscal Q4, which translates flat compared with the previous year. The company continues an effort to boost lagging sales in China and improve its inventory situation. NKE stock continues to be a blue-chip under-performer.Story continuesBoeing Co. (BA)image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraftSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.comThe shares of commercial aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) might look like they’re recovering, up 9% on the year.In reality, BA stock is currently trading 40% lower than where it was five years ago, highlighting the long-term problems with the company and its underperforming stock. The latest issue to hit Boeing was news that the company had temporarily halted deliveries of some of its marquee 737 MAX airplanes due to technical problems.Specifically, Boeing said that it has run into quality problems with the parts of the 737 MAX aircraft that are manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR). True, the issue is being resolved and orders of Boeing’s other aircraft continue unaffected,. But the 737 delivery halt certainly hasn’t inspired any confidence. This is happening while Boeing tries to put several high profile crashes of its aircraft behind it.Given the ongoing and long-term problems with BA stock, investors would be best advised to part ways with this blue-chip name.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comFor a company that is supposed to be a hedge against inflation, consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) has been a real disappointment. Year-to-date, PG stock is down 2% compared with an 18% increase in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.This, despite the essential nature of the Procter &amp; Gamble products, which include Tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers and Gillette razor blades. In truth, the stock has struggled to gain traction. So naturally, the underperformance has no doubt left stockholders frustrated.In this year’s first quarter, Procter &amp; Gamble reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts’ expectations across the board. The company announced earnings per share of $1.37 versus $1.32 that had been forecast among analysts. Revenue came in at $20.07 billion versus $19.32 billion that was anticipated.However, P&amp;G’s Q1 sales volume fell 3% as consumers chose cheaper alternatives to its products. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of sales decline. The company will report earnings July 28.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out the 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.In the first half of 2023, global economic growth picked up pace, reaching 2.8%. Up to this point, the impact of monetary tightening was balanced by the diminishing supply shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, since 2022, the surge in global policy rates by approximately 400 basis points (bps) has begun to affect interest-sensitive spending and impede factory output. Despite the current momentum, the fading resiliency of the global economy suggests that growth moderation is likely unavoidable. Speaking of the United States specifically, J.P. Morgan Research expects the country to undergo a mild recession towards the end of 2023. This prediction comes from the Federal Reserve's adoption of a restrictive policy stance, which is expected to lead to tighter credit conditions, consequently dragging down the economy.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan., stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to economists at Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25% from their previous projection of 35%, which was made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Research projects a robust annual average growth of 1.8% for this year, surpassing the consensus among private-sector economists and the projections made by the Federal Reserve.Story continuesIn the realm of investing, volatility holds significant importance. It becomes evident to investors during market downturns when certain individual stocks, characterized by higher volatility, undergo substantial price fluctuations. Additionally, it serves as a proxy for risk; higher volatility often implies a riskier portfolio. As an example, certain sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are known for being less volatile than others, making them potentially safer investment options during times of recession. Business Insider's report indicated that the consumer staples industry had outperformed the overall market by an impressive 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015, with much of this outperformance observed during recessionary periods. Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average experienced only a marginal decline of 1.4% in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 faced a substantial 19.4% decrease during the same period.See also: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowAs the first half of this year came to a close, the market received a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report. This has led some to question the need for acquiring the safer holdings as the overall market sentiment remains strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors. Although investors may be inclined to favor riskier securities with higher potential returns in such a market environment, it is important to realize that the market can shift and turn at any moment. In that regard, low volatility stocks serve as safe harbors for investors who are averse to turbulent market swings. Their comparatively steady performance not only aids in minimizing losses during downturns but also prevents hasty panic selling that could jeopardize one's retirement savings. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some low volatility stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), among others listed below.12 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected the following low risk stocks suitable based on optimistic analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The betas for these firms were below 1.0 as of July 19, which means these stocks are less risky as compared to the broader market. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.12. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Beta Value: 0.62Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a prominent American corporation renowned as one of the largest producers and marketers of tobacco, cigarettes, and related products worldwide. Its global operations are based in Henrico County, Virginia. With an impressive 54-year streak of dividend increases, few companies are as experienced as Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) in effectively navigating market downturns.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were long Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) at the end of the first quarter of 2023, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Natixis Global Asset Management's Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 6.33 million shares worth $282.77 million.Much like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a smart low volatility stock that investors should take note of.11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Beta Value: 0.35Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), commonly known as Verizon, is an American multinational telecommunication conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the first quarter of 2023, the telecommunications firm reported an increase of 633,000 subscribers.On June 1, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 1, to shareholders of record on July 10.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Billionaire Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $188.5 million.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Beta Value: 0.54Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a major American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. The company is a global leader in the beverage industry, and is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $77 to $74 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Although the analyst perceives KO as a stronger defensive stock during inflationary periods compared to its historical performance, he expresses near-term apprehension concerning the ongoing tax litigation.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”9. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.64McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 46 years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.52 per share and its dividend yield on July 19 stood at 2.07%.On April 25, the company released its most recent fiscal quarter results, surpassing the consensus earnings forecast. The revenue exhibited a notable 4% year-over-year growth, exceeding the consensus revenue forecast by over $300 million, while the adjusted EPS expanded from $2.28 to $2.63.At the end of Q1 2023, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), up from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $4 billion. With over 1.64 million shares, Paul Marshall And Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was the company’s leading stakeholder.8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Beta Value: 0.35Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, the company is renowned developing and manufacturing medicines and vaccines spanning various fields, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. Notably, in 2022, Pfizer's top-performing product was the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, which generated an impressive $37.8 billion in alliance revenues and direct sales.The biotech company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 13 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.50%, as of July 19.At the end of March 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), worth collectively roughly $2.2 billion. Of these, Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest shareholder, with total stakes worth approximately $380.28 million.7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.54AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) operates as a specialized biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of drugs designed to address chronic and complex diseases. The company is best known for manufacturing its blockbuster drug Humira — a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.With a record of 50 years of continuous dividend growth, the American pharmaceutical company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with yield of 4.30% as of July 19.As of the close of Q1 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q1.Harding Loevner mentioned AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.41The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is a low volatility stock that hedge funds are piling into.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.Suggested articles:12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $2510 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $1010 Best One Dollar Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

In the last reported quarter, the company beat earnings expectations by 23.0%.Factors to NotePfizer’s revenues are expected to have declined in the second quarter of 2023 due to steep expected declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products on lower demand.Pfizer records direct sales and alliance revenues from its partner, BioNTech BNTX for the COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and product revenues from its oral antiviral pill for COVID, Paxlovid.Our estimate for direct sales and alliance revenues from Comirnaty is $1.23 billion, while that for Paxlovid is $610 million.Pfizer expects significantly lower sales from its COVID products in the second quarter versus the first quarter. More substantial deliveries are expected to start in the late third quarter in the United States and beginning of the fourth quarter in international markets.Excluding revenues from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Pfizer’s revenues are expected to have risen, driven by key brands like Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis and Prevnar family of vaccines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eliquis alliance revenues is $1.86 billion, Prevnar family of vaccines is $1.50 million and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax is $722 million.Our model estimates Eliquis alliance revenues of $2.0 billion, Prevnar family of vaccines revenues of $1.47 billion and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax revenues of $682 million.Newly acquired products, including Nurtec ODT/Vydura for migraine and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease, are expected to have contributed to the top line in the quarter. Nurtec ODT/Vydura was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of Biohaven in 2022. Oxbryta was added with the October 2022 acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics.However, sales of key medicine, Ibrance in the United States are likely to have declined due to planned price decreases in some international developed markets and lower clinical trial purchases. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ibrance is $1.29 billion, while our estimate is $1.32 billion.Story continuesSales of some key drugs like Xeljanz and Enbrel in international markets are likely to have declined in the second quarter, continuing the trend of the past few quarters. Sales of Enbrel in key European markets and Japan are likely to have been hurt by biosimilar competition. Lower prices and prescription volumes globally, with changes in doctors’ prescribing patterns from JAK inhibitors following label warnings, are likely to have hurt Xeljanz’s sales in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xeljanz and Enbrel is pegged at $341 million and $214.0 million, respectively, while our estimate is $357.4 million and $218.4 million, respectively.Lower revenues from COVID products, coupled with higher spending for near-term launches and late-stage pipeline candidates, are expected to have hurt profits.In May, the FDA approved Pfizer’s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults, which will be marketed by the name of Abrysvo. We expect the company to discuss the RSV vaccine’s commercialization plans on the Q2 conference call. In June, the FDA approved Litfulo (ritlecitinib), its JAK3 inhibitor for treating severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents. The FDA also approved Ngenla a long-acting once-weekly treatment for pediatric growth hormone deficiency, in the same month.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe drug giant’s performance has been strong, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters.

Luis said he then buys dollar-denominated stablecoins on overseas crypto markets, which he barters for pesos on peer-to-peer exchanges in Argentina -- all under the radar of Argentine tax and financial authorities.""I was working so much, putting in extra hours [in IT], and I said, 'to hell with it,"" said Luis, who only used his first name to avoid being identified by tax authorities.

Why is Elon Musk so obsessed with the 24th letter of the alphabet, and why is he replacing Twitter’s globally recognized logo, namely the Twitter bird, with a generic letter?Not only has the Twitter owner changed his profile picture to the new X logo and made his profile bio “X.com,” but the company’s official name is now X Corp., owned by the holding company X Holdings Corp., according to legal filings. Musk has been planning the X transformation since he acquired Twitter, saying he wants to create a digital town square where anything goes.“Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,” Musk tweeted in October, shortly before he purchased the service for $44 billion.The 24th letter has been a consistent presence in the billionaire’s business brandings and personal life for decades. In 1999, the tech magnate founded the original version of X.com, an online banking startup that eventually became PayPal, with three partners in Palo Alto, Calif. Eventually, Musk was ousted from the company in favor of Peter Thiel.Musk also has a child, born in 2020 with the musician formerly known as Grimes, named X Æ A-Xii (nicknamed X). In explaining the baby’s name on Twitter, Grimes said that X stood for “the unknown variable.” At Tesla, X is present, but only plays a supporting role. The Tesla Model X is one in a series of four cars, the S, 3, and Y. Together, they create the acronym S3XY—hardly a mathematical reference.However, the Twitter rebranding harkens back to Musk’s beginnings as a businessman, and his history with the company now known as PayPal. Julie Anderson Ankenbrandt, an early PayPal executive, posted about the company’s naming on Quora.“Elon, the other founders of the company that was x .com…and I sat around a backroom table at a long-defunct bar called the Blue Chalk in Palo Alto, trying decide what the name of the company should be… and the question at hand was whether to be q, x, or z dot com,” Anderson Ankenbradnt wrote in 2016. “Finally, when the waitress/female server brought the next round of drinks Elon asked her what she thought, and she said she like[d] x.com. Elon pounded the table and said “That’s it then!” and everyone laughed, but in the end that was pretty much how it was decided.”Story continuesDespite Musk’s 2000 ouster from X.com/PayPal, in which Thiel and his loyalists voted to change the company’s leadership and strip Musk of power while he was on a honeymoon in Australia, the Tesla CEO still has a soft spot for the early venture. Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal in 2017, at the time for purely nostalgic purposes.He wrote in 2017 that he had “no plans” yet for the domain, but that it had “great sentimental value” to him. When another user tweeted at Musk suggesting that he use X.com as an “umbrella website” for all his other companies, Musk replied that that was probably the best use of the domain.Now he seems to be realizing that vision by using Twitter’s existing structure as a launchpad for X as an “everything app” that will likely house multiple functions. It’s unclear whether many of the original Twitter features will survive, as Musk already intends to scrap other pillars of the network’s branding, according to his posts on the platform. Specifically, he tweeted that tweets should now be called “x’s” and that the concept of retweeting “should be rethought.”Twitter’s X-mutation may be an ambitious play to create a new, all-encompassing kind of online network—or it could be Musk’s way of licking wounds that even two decades and billions of dollars haven’t numbed.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This passion continued throughout college and in the years after graduating where he and his partner started to donate plants to nonprofit auctions in order to clear out space. This has grown into his business today, Grow for Good 417, a shop that sells plants, unique garden art, and hosts plant parties.Story continuesAccording to Craig, he turned to Venmo because it ""helps me build my community by accepting payments for the plants I sell at ease—even if I don't have a credit card reader on hand.""""Winning the Venmo grant meant quite a bit to us,"" said Craig. ""It meant that we were able to help out the community by sponsoring nonprofits throughout the year [and] helped us expand our business to a more permanent location in a shipping container.""Cake CaféA lot of today's small business owners left the corporate world to pursue their passions. Verná Mungin left a job she knew like the back of her hand to go to culinary school. Now she owns Cake Café, a dessert shop that specializes in custom cakes and cake jars.Verná found the mentorship services as part of the program helpful and informative. ""The round table with Start Small Think Big helped break [big responsibilities] down into simple things that I could do,"" she said. ""I left that round table with five pages of notes. They helped with simple marketing ideas I could do myself.""Krysalis KoutureKrysalis Kouture makes vibrant and expertly crafted headscarves for those who have experienced hair loss. The business was born from owner Paloma Soledad's experience with cancer and has blossomed into a successful small business.""Winning the small business grant meant the world to me,"" said Paloma.""It not only enabled me to pay for things that I had to do, but it gave me hope, and you need that to feel like you can keep going sometimes.""To enter this year's Venmo Small Business Grant, entrants must set up a Venmo business profile and complete an application by August 7, 2023, at 11:59 p.m. EST.

223,400973b3-7b13-3651-bd5d-95bf8ac28532,IBM,2023-07-25,"International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) shareholders notch a 10% CAGR over 3 years, yet earnings have been shrinking",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-nyse-ibm-110134280.html,1690282894,STORY,['IBM'],"[Investors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. That's what has happened with the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) share price. It's up 11% over three years, but that is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 8.6% in the last year.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the last three years, International Business Machines failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 35% (annualized).Earnings per share have melted like a stack of ice cubes, in stark contrast to the share price. So we'll need to take a look at some different metrics to try to understand why the share price remains solid.Interestingly, the dividend has increased over time; so that may have given the share price a boost. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on International Business MachinesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, International Business Machines' TSR for the last 3 years was 35%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInternational Business Machines' TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 14%. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 5% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +17.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.84 indicates a change of +4.6% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.8 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $61.46 billion and $64.09 billion estimates indicate +1.5% and +4.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was +9%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In our brief time together, I asked Jim why his company's stock traded on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 15 times (discount to the broader market) whereas Microsoft is north of 30 times (premium to the broader market).IBM does cool stuff, I think, and is doing more of it increasingly in high-growth areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The company's lucrative consultancy business also had a very solid second quarter.Kavanaugh acknowledged the valuation gap between the two tech icons and said it would close with a steady stream of consistent execution.Perhaps that will happen.But the exchange left an impression on me: While IBM fights to command a more premium valuation in a hot tech market, Microsoft's valuation will keep expanding. So why not continue to ride the Microsoft juggernaut as an investor?Microsoft has winning momentum that is supporting higher profit estimates, higher valuation estimates, and higher cash flow estimates.The first place to look for Microsoft's momentum is, naturally, AI.Microsoft's reveal of its AI subscription pricing last week sent the stock to a new high — and with good reason, Jefferies veteran tech analyst Brent Thill explained.""AI is already benefiting Azure results and this should only be the beginning given Microsoft's pole position in a decade-long industry evolution. Microsoft announced M365 copilot pricing of $30 per user/month, which reflects a 53-83% pricing uplift, far greater than the 15-30% previously thought,"" said Thill. ""If just half of our conservative estimate of ~115 million E3 &amp; E5 users adopt M365 copilot, M365 copilot could drive $20.6 billion in incremental revenue representing ~53% growth from FY23 O365 commercial revenue or ~10% upside to FY23 total revenue. Hence, we believe that M365 copilot could help double O365 commercial revenue in the next 4-5 years.""Story continuesThose are huge potential financial statement drivers. Actually, they helped Microsoft set the stage for a major reset upwards of Street expectations, not unlike what Nvidia did a few months ago.So there is all of that.While Microsoft drives towards its AI future, the near term appears quite nice as well.The company's cloud business Azure continues to hum as the economy enters a ""steady state"" period, as characterized to me in a chat with American Express CEO Stephen Squeri.""Our recent CIO Survey showed stable, but muted, IT budget growth expectations for CY23. However, several forward looking indicators in the CIO survey support Microsoft's strong relative positioning within those muted CY23 budgets growth expectations, including Microsoft being the only software vendor in our survey for which forward growth expectations actually improved sequentially in our survey,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss pointed out.Notice I haven't even dived into the possible material profit lift from the addition of Activision Blizzard. I am running out of room on this page but will simply say this gaming deal will be another big tailwind to Microsoft.What can go wrong with this bull's dream story? Perhaps the economy falls off a cliff and Satya Nadella steps down as CEO in 2024.But I don't see either happening.And that means more winning for MicrosoftEarnings are out July 25.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

QuoteFactors at PlayFEMSA has been reaping the benefits of its diversified business, continued strength in OXXO Mexico and OXXO Gas, expansion into newer businesses, and digital initiatives. These positives have been well reflected in its earnings performance.The company has been on track with its strategy of creating a distribution platform in the United States through the expansion of its footprint in the specialized distribution industry. Its venture in the specialized distribution industry relates to its plan of investing in adjacent businesses, which can leverage capabilities across different markets, providing an opportunity for attractive growth and risk-adjusted returns. These efforts are expected to have contributed to the company’s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s second-quarter results are expected to reflect growth through investments in digital and technology-driven initiatives. Its focus on offering customers more options to make contactless purchases by intensifying digital and technology-driven initiatives across operations has been aiding the digital performance.The company’s Coca-Cola FEMSA has been leading the way with its omnichannel business, whereas FEMSA Comercio has been progressing with the adoption of digital initiatives. Investments in digital offerings, loyalty programs and fintech platforms bode well. Its OXXO digital wallet, OXXO Premia and loyalty program have also been performing well. Such endeavors are likely to have aided revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect revenues for the Proximity division to increase 16.6% year over year in the second quarter, backed by gains in the OXXO retail business. Revenues for the Fuel, Health and Coca-Cola FEMSA businesses are expected to increase 17.1%, 13.1% and 16.3%, respectively, in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company has been witnessing margin pressures, which are expected to have continued in the second quarter. FEMSA’s performance is expected to have been partly hurt by the impacts of supply-chain disruptions and higher raw material costs. Inflation in steel and aluminum prices is expected to have been concerning.We estimate the operating margin to decline 80 basis points year over year to 8.4% in the second quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FEMSA this time around.

SAM is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27. In the second quarter, the company is anticipated to have registered top and bottom-line declines from the prior-year quarter’s reported figures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.45 per share, suggesting a decline of 20% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has declined 3.9% in the past seven days. For quarterly revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $598.8 million, suggesting a 2.8% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.In the last reported quarter, SAM delivered a negative earnings surprise of 128.1%. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 88.7%, on average.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteBoston Beer has been witnessing declines in shipments and depletions, as well as continued challenges in the hard seltzer category. This has been weighing on the company’s top-line performance. For the second quarter of 2023, the company anticipated shipments to be at the low end of the company’s 2023 guidance of a 2-8% decline, backed by the launch of Truly Margarita.Our model estimates shipment volumes to decline 4.1% in the second quarter. Depletions for the second quarter are expected to be down 1%.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management indicated that the company’s second quarter results would remain sensitive to changes in volume projections, mostly related to the hard seltzer category, supply-chain performance and inflationary impacts. It anticipated slowed hard seltzer sales to mainly impact SAM’s Truly hard seltzer performance, which is expected to continue through the first half of 2023.Continued headwinds from increased costs are expected to have marred the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Inflationary packaging, ingredient and energy costs, elevated inventory obsolescence costs, and higher brewery processing have been weighing on the gross margin in recent quarters.Sluggishness in the hard seltzer category, an unfavorable product mix and supply-chain inefficiencies are expected to have affected Boston Beer’s performance in the quarter under review. Further, higher advertising, promotional and selling expenses are likely to have continued spoiling its performance.We expect the second-quarter adjusted operating margin to decline 300 basis points to 8.7%, driven by a 60-bps increase in advertising, promotional and selling expenses.However, continued strength across the Beyond Beer portfolio is likely to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Beyond Beer is growing faster than the traditional beer market, and SAM expects this trend to continue for the next several years. Gains of this trend are likely to get reflected in the company’s second-quarter results.SAM’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation, growth of non-beer categories and brand development is likely to have boosted its operational performance and position in the market. Its focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential bodes well. As part of product innovation, the company expects to improve the Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on core business, smart brand innovation, and strong distributor support and retail execution.Boston Beer’s commitment to the three-point growth plan — focus on reviving its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives and innovation — is expected to have contributed to its quarterly performance.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boston Beer this time around.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseChurch &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. QuoteSolid pricing actions to counter cost inflation have been aiding the company’s organic sales. CHD’s organic sales increased 5.7% in the first quarter due to favorable pricing to the tune of 5.7%. For 2023, management expects pricing and productivity to more than offset cost inflation. These aspects bode well for the quarter under review. We expect a 3.3% increase in organic sales for the second quarter of 2023, with the pricing/product mix anticipated to be up 6.1%.However, the company has been witnessing increasing marketing and SG&amp;A expenses for the past few quarters. For 2023, Church &amp; Dwight intends to increase marketing expenses as a percent of sales by 50 bps from the year-ago period.It also expects SG&amp;A both in dollars and as a percent of net sales to increase from 2022 as the company’s incentive compensation plan returns to normal levels in 2023.

Equivalents and Restricted Cash at End of Period$569$1,227$569$1,227Second Quarter 2023 OverviewIn the second quarter 2023, resilient demand and balanced execution drove another quarter of growth in revenue, profits, and cash flow. Recent improvements in financial performance are driven by an intense focus on our three strategic priorities, which includes a focus on delivering client success through products and services that address the productivity challenges of today’s hybrid workplace.Equipment sales revenue of $420 million in the second quarter 2023 increased 14.8% in actual currency and 14.3% in constant currency1 as compared to the prior year period, reflecting stable demand and improved product availability, particularly in the Americas, and for our higher margin A3 devices. As expected, backlog2 returned to normalized levels and since we do not expect changes in backlog2 to materially affect results going forward, we will no longer provide detailed backlog2 information. Consistent with recent quarters, revenue growth outpaced equipment installations due to favorable mix and pricing. Post-sale revenue of $1.3 billion in the second quarter 2023 declined 3.4% in actual currency as compared to the prior year period and 3.2% in constant currency1. The decrease was driven primarily by non-contractual items, including lower IT hardware and paper sales, lower finance income and the cessation of Fuji royalties, partially offset by gains and commissions on sales of finance receivables.Pre-tax loss increased year-over-year driven by a net pre-tax charge of $132 million related to the donation of our Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), partially offset by continued cost reduction actions, supply chain-related cost improvements and higher revenues. Adjusted1 operating income, which excludes the PARC donation, was also higher year-over-year as a result of these impacts. These benefits were partially offset by currency, the cessation of Fuji royalty income, higher bad debt and employee compensation expenses. We continue to expect to deliver low to mid-single digit gross operating cost efficiencies for the year.Total Revenue is expected to be flat to down low-single-digits in constant currency1 in 2023. Adjusted1 operating income margin is expected to increase from a range of 5.0% to 5.5%, to a range of 5.5% to 6.0%, due to a stronger-than-expected realization of operating efficiencies and revenue mix. We also expect free cash flow1 for 2023 to increase from ""at least $500 million"" to ""at least $600 million"". The increase reflects an improvement in expected operating income and incremental sales of finance receivables.Segment Reporting ChangeDuring the second quarter 2023, as a result of the recent strategic shift in the Company’s approach to funding FITTLE’s growth through finance receivables funding agreements that involve the sale of lease receivables, the measures of the FITTLE’s segment revenues and profits used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), our Chief Executive Officer, were recast as follows to correspond with this change in strategy:The management and oversight of the equipment on operating leases portion of our financing business was transferred from the FITTLE segment to the marketing and sales groups in the Print and Other segment since the finance receivables funding agreements currently exclude the sale of operating lease arrangements.The allocation of shared expenses as well as commissions and other payments made by the FITTLE segment to the Print and Other segment were recast to better reflect the operations of FITTLE in line with the change in strategic direction.The recast to our segment measures align with the financial information used by our CODM in evaluating our reportable segments’ performance and allocating resources. The prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the change in segment measures of revenue and profits. See Segment Review - 2023 Segment Reporting Change for recast made to conform to our new segment measurements.________(1)Refer to the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measure.(2)Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be installed, including orders with future installation dates. It includes printing devices as well as IT hardware associated with our IT service offerings.Donation of Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)On April 29, 2023, Xerox completed the donation of its Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) subsidiary to Stanford Research Institute International (SRI), a nonprofit research institute. The donation enables Xerox to focus on its core businesses and prioritize growth through its business technology solutions for customers in Print, as well as Digital Services and IT Services. The donation also allows PARC to reach its full potential through SRI’s resources and deep-tech expertise that will enable PARC to focus exclusively on the development of pioneering innovative technologies. The majority of patents held by PARC will be retained by Xerox with a perpetual license to use those patents being provided to SRI. Xerox, at its option, will also continue to receive certain research services from SRI. The donation resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $132 million in the second quarter 2023, which includes allocated Goodwill of $115 million. Xerox also recorded a net income tax benefit of $40 million related to the donation for a net after-tax loss on the donation of $92 million.Financial ReviewRevenuesThree Months EndedJune 30,% of TotalRevenue(in millions)20232022%ChangeCC %Change20232022Equipment sales$420$36614.8%14.3%24%21%Post sale revenue1,3341,381(3.4)%(3.2)%76%79%Total Revenue$1,754$1,7470.4%0.5%100%100%Reconciliation to Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income:Sales$696$6674.3%4.1%Less: Supplies, paper and other sales(276)(301)(8.3)%(8.5)%Equipment Sales$420$36614.8%14.3%Services, maintenance and rentals$1,009$1,028(1.8)%(1.6)%Add: Supplies, paper and other sales276301(8.3)%(8.5)%Add: Financing4952(5.8)%(4.0)%Post Sale Revenue$1,334$1,381(3.4)%(3.2)%SegmentsPrint and Other$1,674$1,6730.1%95%96%FITTLE101965.2%6%5%Intersegment elimination (1)(21)(22)(4.5)%(1)%(1)%Total Revenue(2)$1,754$1,7470.4%100%100%Go-to-Market OperationsAmericas$1,154$1,1500.3%0.7%66%66%EMEA5705513.4%3.1%32%31%Other3046(34.8)%(34.8)%2%3%Total Revenue(2)$1,754$1,7470.4%0.5%100%100%______________CC -

The words ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""will"", ""should"", ""targeting"", ""projecting"", ""driving"" and similar expressions, as they relate to us, our performance and/or our technology, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. Such factors include but are not limited to: Global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, delays or disruptions in the global supply chain, higher interest rates, and wars and other conflicts, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine; our ability to succeed in a competitive environment, including by developing new products and service offerings and preserving our existing products and market share as well as repositioning our business in the face of customer preference, technological, and other change, such as evolving return-to-office and hybrid working trends; failure of our customers, vendors, and logistics partners to perform their contractual obligations to us; our ability to attract, train, and retain key personnel; the risk of breaches of our security systems due to cyber, malware, or other intentional attacks that could expose us to liability, litigation, regulatory action or damage our reputation; our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to maintain and improve our cost structure; changes in economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, and tax laws in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we do business; the risk that multi-year contracts with governmental entities could be terminated prior to the end of the contract term and that civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could be imposed on us if we fail to comply with the terms of such contracts and applicable law; interest rates, cost of borrowing, and access to credit markets; risks related to our indebtedness; the imposition of new or incremental trade protection measures such as tariffs and import or export restrictions; funding requirements associated with our employee pension and retiree health benefit plans; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the risk that our operations and products may not comply with applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, particularly environmental regulations and directives and anti-corruption laws; the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we may be a party; laws, regulations, international agreements and other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change, as well as the physical effects of climate change; and other factors as set forth from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.The Company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the date of this release and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available, except as required by law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth below, as well as in the second quarter 2023 presentation slides available at www.xerox.com/investor.Adjusted Earnings MeasuresAdjusted Net Income and Earnings per share (EPS)Adjusted Effective Tax RateThe above measures were adjusted for the following items:Restructuring and related costs, net: Restructuring and related costs, net include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our transformation programs beyond those normally included in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Restructuring consists of costs primarily related to severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to formal restructuring and workforce reduction plans. Asset impairment includes costs incurred for those assets sold, abandoned or made obsolete as a result of our restructuring actions, exiting from a business or other strategic business changes. Additional costs for our transformation programs are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives and include third-party professional service costs as well as one-time incremental costs. All of these costs can vary significantly in terms of amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of the business. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we will exclude these charges since we do not believe they provide meaningful insight into our current or past operating performance nor do we believe they are reflective of our expected future operating expenses as such charges are expected to yield future benefits and savings with respect to our operational performance.Amortization of intangible assets: The amortization of intangible assets is driven by our acquisition activity which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.Non-service retirement-related costs: Our defined benefit pension and retiree health costs include several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by changes in the debt and equity markets as well as those that are predominantly legacy in nature and related to employees who are no longer providing current service to the Company (e.g. retirees and ex-employees). These elements include (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains/losses and (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments. Accordingly, we consider these elements of our periodic retirement plan costs to be outside the operational performance of the business or legacy costs and not necessarily indicative of current or future cash flow requirements. This approach is consistent with the classification of these costs as non-operating in Other expenses, net. Adjusted earnings will continue to include the service cost elements of our retirement costs, which is related to current employee service as well as the cost of our defined contribution plans.Discrete, unusual or infrequent items: We exclude these item(s), when applicable, given their discrete, unusual or infrequent nature and their impact on the comparability of our results for the period to prior periods and future expected trends:PARC donationAccelerated share vesting - stock compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards, according to the terms of the award agreement, in connection with the passing of Xerox Holding's former CEO.Loss on early extinguishment of debtAdjusted Operating Income and MarginWe calculate and utilize adjusted operating income (loss) and margin measures by adjusting our reported pre-tax income (loss) and margin amounts. In addition to the costs and expenses noted as adjustments for our adjusted earnings measures, adjusted operating income and margin also exclude the remaining amounts included in Other expenses, net, which are primarily non-financing interest expense and certain other non-operating costs and expenses. We exclude these amounts in order to evaluate our current and past operating performance and to better understand the expected future trends in our business.Constant Currency (CC)To better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust revenue to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to this adjusted revenue as ""constant currency."" This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

A Comprehensive Analysis,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aes-corp-aes-modestly-undervalued-233434562.html,1690155274,STORY,"['AES', 'AESC']","[On July 23, 2023, The AES Corp (NYSE:AES) recorded a 3.02% gain, with its stock price reaching $22.49. With a market cap of $15.1 billion, the company's GF Value stands at $25.88, suggesting that it's modestly undervalued. The AES Corp, a global power company, operates a diverse generation portfolio of over 32 gigawatts, including renewable energy, gas, coal, and oil. Serving 2.6 million customers through its six electric utilities, the company's sales reached $13 billion, despite a Loss Per Share of $-0.82.Understanding the GF Value of The AES Corp (NYSE:AES)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AES. Click here to check it out. AES 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AESPeter Lynch Chart of AESThe AES (NYSE:AES) stock appears to be modestly undervalued according to the GuruFocus Value calculation. The GF Value, which represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded, is calculated based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor from GuruFocus, and estimates of future business performance. If a stock's price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it's overvalued and likely to deliver poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Given The AES's current price and market cap, the stock seems modestly undervalued.Because The AES is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Is The AES Corp (AES) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of The AESCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, investors must research and review a companys financial strength before purchasing shares. Two key indicators of financial strength are the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. The AES has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.09, ranking worse than 74.85% of companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. The overall financial strength of The AES is 3 out of 10, indicating that its financial strength is poor.Story continuesIs The AES Corp (AES) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisProfitability and Growth of The AESInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. The AES has been profitable 6 times over the past 10 years. With a revenue of $13 billion and a Loss Per Share of $-0.82 over the past twelve months, its operating margin is 18.47%, ranking better than 68.2% of companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of The AES at 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a key factor in the valuation of a company. Faster-growing companies create more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of The AES is 7.3%, ranking worse than 52.59% of companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -13.6%, ranking worse than 89.11% of companies in the same industry.Comparing ROIC and WACC of The AESComparing a companys return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, The AESs ROIC was 19.51, while its WACC came in at 7.19.Is The AES Corp (AES) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive AnalysisConclusionIn conclusion, The AES Corp's (NYSE:AES) stock appears to be modestly undervalued. Despite its poor financial condition, the company's profitability is fair. However, its growth ranks worse than 89.11% of companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.

The Nasdaq Composite remains in view of its 52-week high hit on July 19.To be sure, market strategist bears such as Kolanovic and Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson have a host of fresh stats to support their downtrodden views.First is a mixed start to earnings season, at best.For every strong performer in the mold of a PepsiCo (PEP) and General Motors (GM) (earnings beats, guidance lifts, and solid earnings calls), there have been equal doses of Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) — disappointing overall reports that sent share prices sharply lower.And overall, the earnings season numbers don't look that grand.Among the 20% or so of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported second quarter earnings, sales are on pace for a lackluster 0.2% year-on-year drop. Earnings are tracking lower by 9.3%, according to Evercore ISI data.The average stock price has dropped 1% post the companies' earnings reports.Story continuesMeantime, fresh signs are emerging that overseas economies are far from healthy, another potential reason to doubt the justification of robust stock valuations.Consider this: The latest composite French Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) — a measure of economic activity — hit a 32-month low. Germany's composite PMI just reached an eight-month low. Overall, Eurozone PMIs are at eight-month lows.Bronze sculptures depicting a bull and bear stand in front of the stock market in Frankfurt, Germany, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2019. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Finally, the most recent reads on China's economy have also been soft, spurring a surprise cut to one of its key lending rates in late June.""The equity rally over the past two months implies macroeconomic scenarios that are even more positive than a soft landing. We maintain that this market action is largely a result of mechanical re-risking,"" Kolanovic went on to warn.Other pros suggest investors should be developing contingency plans such as rotating out of momentum tech trades and into relatively safer dividend-payers.""Whenever the stock market reaches today’s valuation levels, 'price' always falls to resolve the divergence. Therefore, investors should develop contingency strategies now … even if the resolution to today’s divergence doesn’t take place for a while,"" notes Miller Tabak chief markets strategist Matt Maley.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We thought the conference call yielded mostly positive takeaways including with regards to Cruise, new savings, and a confident stance on EV demand. The negative stock reversal (we think unwarranted) could be tied to the unexpected Q2 Bolt charge (absorbed in the beat/raise), the EV module equipment issue noted on the call (not a surprise and mgmt. sounded confident of near-term resolution) and perhaps some interpretation that the return of the Bolt implies less Ultium volume in H1 2024 (not the case per our understanding). Stepping back, the “noise” in the quarter does not seem to us to be very material while the fundamental upside does. We expect material upward consensus revisions ahead of an upcoming ~6+ months when GM can deliver ample EV/AV ramp catalysts (though labor disruption a risk). -Itay Michaeli, CitiStory continuesBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

On a per-share basis, GM is forecasting net income of $7.15 to $8.15 for the year, up from a range of $6.35 to $7.35.The new outlook does not factor in the potential costs of a strike by the United Auto Workers union should it fail to reach a new contract with GM by the Sept. 14 deadline.GM's more bullish outlook comes after six months of stronger demand and richer pricing than expected earlier this year, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during a media conference call.But the decision to cut new product investment and operating costs comes as the automaker's profit margins are under pressure. GM's pre-tax profit margin for the first six months of the year fell to 8.3% of revenue, down from 8.9% a year ago.Profit per vehicle in North America declined from the first quarter. GM earned $3,841 in pre-tax profit per vehicle in North America during the second quarter, down 23% from the first quarter.GM's higher profit outlook reflects decisions to ratchet down spending. It now plans to spend $11 billion to $12 billion on capital investments this year, down from an earlier plan to spend $11 billion to $13 billion.Story continues""There's a lot of focus on winning with simplicity,"" Jacobson said.CEO Mary Barra, on a call with analysts Tuesday, said GM can cut capital spending by simplifying its product line, reducing the number of different combinations of colors and features offered. GM's goal is to cut the number of feature and color trim combinations by half, Barra said.The automaker said it will expand a previously announced drive to cut operating costs by $2 billion through the end of 2024, targeting an additional $1 billion.In contrast to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's strategy of cutting prices to accelerate demand, GM pushed average transaction prices in North America up by $1,600 to about $52,000 in the latest quarter, Jacobson said.""We're focused on profitability. Our recent results demonstrate that we're not sacrificing margin for volume,"" he said.GM's second-quarter results included a $792-million charge for ""new commercial agreements"" with South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution.Barra, in a letter to shareholders, said the automaker is aiming to build ""roughly 100,000 EVs in the second half of this year and we’ll grow from there."" In the first half, GM built about 50,000 EVs, most of them the older Chevrolet Bolt model, which had been scheduled to end production later this year.Barra said GM now plans to introduce an updated version of the Bolt, equipped with an Ultium battery pack.GM's earnings statement reiterated a previous target of building 400,000 EVs from 2022 through the first half of 2024, and projected EV revenue of $50 billion in 2025, with pre-tax profit in the low to mid single digits.In a note to investors, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said he remains ""cautious due to the near-term earnings drag from GM's EV transition and its ability to execute an aggressive production ramp, as well as ultimate demand for its EV models.""Pre-tax losses at Cruise, GM's robo-taxi unit, widened in the latest quarter to $611 million from $543 million a year ago. Cruise's losses for the first half of the year increased by 35% to nearly $1.2 billion.(Reporting by Joseph White and Paul Lienert in Detroit Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit Editing by Matthew Lewis, Louise Heavens and Nick Zieminski)]"

GM's Q2 revenue rose 25% from a year ago and 11.8% sequentially.

GM also sees full-year adjusted EPS in a range of $7.15-$8.15, up from prior projections of $6.35-$7.35.""The biggest driving force behind our financial results is customer demand for our vehicles, which have now led the U.S. industry in initial quality for two consecutive years,"" GM CEO Mary Barra company said in her shareholder letter.""Our products and response by customers has been stronger than a lot of people would have predicted,"" GM CFO Paul Jacobson added in a briefing with reporters.From a profit perspective, GM reported $3.2 billion in adjusted EBIT in Q2, which also includes the impact of a $792 million charge stemming from agreements with battery suppliers LG Electronics and LG Energy Solution due to the Chevrolet Bolt EV recalls from last year. GM said it would end Bolt EV and EUV production at the end of the year; however, in the earnings call, Barra said GM would reintroduce a new Bolt EV in the near future, powered by Ultium battery technology. Barra said more info would be coming soon on the upcoming Bolt.Earlier this month GM reported that Q2 US deliveries rose 18.8% to 691,978, its best result since Q4 of 2020. Higher volume didn't impact GM’s pricing power, however, as Jacobson revealed that GM's average transaction prices (ATP) rose roughly $1,600 in Q2.Story continuesAs for its EV game plan, GM reiterated its plans to produce 400,000 EVs through the first half of 2024 and 1 million by the end of 2025.

(Photo by Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images) (Josh Lefkowitz via Getty Images)With Tesla’s price cuts front and center in the EV landscape, GM has said it will not engage in any EV price cuts, as the automaker sees its pricing strategy as appropriate.Another headwind for GM, as well as its fellow rivals Ford and Stellantis, is the current UAW labor negotiations. The current UAW contract is set to expire on September 14, and the impact on the automakers' financial performance could be severe. GM CEO Mary Barra said in her letter that the company's updated guidance assumes that the automaker ""successfully negotiate[s] new labor agreements without a work stoppage.""When pressed for details on what effect a work stoppage would financially entail, GM's Jacobson said he wouldn't get into ""any speculation on the impact of a work stoppage.""Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Since the fund launched, more than 60,000 United customers have contributed a total of more than $200,000.SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone. To date, United has invested in the future production of over five billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.1""While United can't decarbonize the airline industry alone, we can use our leadership and credibility in this space to rally others to join us,"" said United Airlines Ventures President Michael Leskinen. ""Our new and inaugural participants demonstrate the impressive commitment within aviation and beyond to reduce our carbon footprint and combat the threat of climate change. As companies across the globe are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact from flying, the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund presents a unique opportunity – instead of fighting over the current limited supply of SAF, with our partners, we're working collaboratively to help scale the SAF industry itself, and to get an equity stake in groundbreaking technology while doing it.""Story continuesUnited will continue to recruit corporations across industries to join the fund and will prioritize investment in new technology, advanced fuel sources, and proven producers – all in an effort to help scale the supply of SAF. Partners also have the potential to gain preferential access to environmental attributes associated with United's future supply of SAF.SAF, which currently must be blended with conventional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements for use within the aircraft, is being made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks including household trash or forest waste. Through the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, United intends to invest in a variety of SAF feedstocks and technologies. With the right policy incentives to produce SAF, United's efforts could help build a future of sustainable flight.UAV Sustainable Flight FundThe UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM launched with more than $100 million in investments from United and its inaugural partners Air Canada, Boeing, GE Aerospace, JPMorgan Chase, and Honeywell. Through the fund, these partners and additional corporate participants will invest alongside United in SAF technology and production start-ups identified by United. In the past two years alone, United Airlines Ventures has already made investments in or signed purchase agreements with companies using a variety of ingredients and technologies to produce SAF, including feedstocks like ethanol, animal byproducts, forestry and crop waste, and municipal waste, as well as early-stage, promising technologies like synthetic biology and power to liquids, incorporating renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture processes. United Airlines Ventures has moved selected existing SAF investments into the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM to establish the fund's portfolio.Consumer Awareness and Call to ActionAs part of the fund launch, consumers booking through United for travel within or from the U.S. have an option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM before check-out. Customers have the choice to contribute $1, $3.50 or $7.00. Since the launch, more than 60,000 United customers have contributed for a total of more than $200,000.The default option for customer contributions is set at $3.50 to illustrate the potential impact of customer action at scale: if the 152 million people who flew on United in 2022 each contributed just $3.50 to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, that would be enough to design and build a SAF refinery capable of producing as much as 40 million gallons of alternative fuel annually.2United's Commitment to Net Zero Emissions by 2050United aims to be 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund – United Airlines Ventures – to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis. In May 2023, United received validation of our 2035 near-term emissions reduction target from the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to reduce our carbon intensity 50% from a 2019 base year. This year, United became the first U.S. airline to show customers an estimate of each flight's carbon footprint in their search.About UnitedAt United, Good Leads The Way. With U.S. hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., United operates the most comprehensive global route network among North American carriers and is now the largest airline in the world as measured by available seat miles.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $58.23 in the previous session. United Airlines has gained 52.8% since the start of the year compared to the 14.7% move for the Zacks Transportation sector and the 36.1% return for the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 19, 2023, United reported EPS of $5.03 versus consensus estimate of $3.99 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.8%.For the current fiscal year, United is expected to post earnings of $9.89 per share on $53 billion in revenues. This represents a 292.46% change in EPS on a 17.9% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $11.15 per share on $55.94 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12.76% and 5.54%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUnited may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.United has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 5.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 10.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 5.5X versus its peer group's average of 8.6X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, United currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if United passes the test. Thus, it seems as though United shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does UAL Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of UAL have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Air France-KLM SA (AFLYY). AFLYY has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. Air France-KLM SA beat our consensus estimate by 1,200%, and for the current fiscal year, AFLYY is expected to post earnings of $0.39 per share on revenue of $30.55 billion.Shares of Air France-KLM SA have gained 0.5% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.67X and a P/CF of 0.39X.The Transportation - Airline industry is in the top 18% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for UAL and AFLYY, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This saw the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 closing higher for the second consecutive week. Although the Fed is likely to go for another interest rate hike this week, optimism has gripped markets that it could likely be the last of the hikes before the Fed ends its monetary tightening cycle.Both the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) declined in June. CPI increased 3% year over year in June after rising 4% in May, its lowest level since March 2021. Month over month, CPI rose just 0.2% in June.Core CPI, which strips out the volatile energy and food prices, also rose a modest 0.2% in June, while on a year-over-year basis, it rose 4.8%, its smallest increase in nearly two years. PPI increased 0.2% in June.Food prices rose in June, but the situation is far better than the year-ago period. Inflation cooled to 4.8% in June after hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022.The Fed has increased interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022. The central bank finally left interest rates unchanged in its June meeting but said that two more interest rate hikes of 25 basis points would be needed by the end of this year.This has somewhat raised concerns about the economy slowing further. However, the impressive inflation data has now raised hopes that the Fed might end its monetary tightening policy after a 25-basis point hike in its upcoming July FOMC meeting.Slowing inflation has also seen consumer confidence making a solid jump in June. Consumer confidence climbed to 109.7 in June from May’s reading of 102.5, to hit the highest level since January 2022.Moreover, the Present Situation Index, which indicates consumers’ assessment of the present labor market and business conditions, rose to 155.3 in June from 148.9 in May.Higher interest rates can affect consumer spending patterns, raise borrowing costs and slow economic growth. These would weigh on the stock market performance.Story continuesCompanies in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to benefit from cooling inflation and a pause in interest rate hikes because consumers will likely have more discretionary income, which can be used for non-essential purchases.Our ChoicesThus, from an investment perspective, we have identified four stocks from the consumer discretionary sector that are likely to capitalize on reduced inflationary pressure. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Ross Stores has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Costco has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ROST has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ROST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.75, while COST has a forward P/E of 38.74. We also note that ROST has a PEG ratio of 2.17. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. COST currently has a PEG ratio of 4.66.Another notable valuation metric for ROST is its P/B ratio of 8.89. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, COST has a P/B of 10.49.These metrics, and several others, help ROST earn a Value grade of B, while COST has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesROST sticks out from COST in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ROST is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:V) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-ownership-shares-visa-inc-110104717.html,1690282864,STORY,['V'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Visa's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 77% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Visa. Check out our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Visa. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Visa, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Visa. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.2% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.0% and 3.6% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of VisaThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Visa Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$247m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Visa  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

264,7e6a4965-79c5-3325-bd64-d2fb754c00e4,V,2023-07-25,"Tom Russo Net Worth, Performance and Portfolio",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tom-russo-net-worth-performance-185613322.html,1690224973,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'NFLX', 'PM', 'GOOGL', 'V', 'MA']","[In this article, we discuss Tom Russo’s hedge fund performance and top stocks. If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the hedge fund manager’s portfolio, head directly to Tom Russo's Top 5 Holdings. Thomas A. Russo has been a partner at Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner, now Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn, since 1989 and became the managing member in 2014. Russo's stock selection approach considers value and price together, seeking companies with strong cash-flow characteristics and robust balance sheets. His investment philosophy centers on a few industries known for generating sustainable net free cash flow, such as food, beverage, tobacco, and advertising-supported media. He aims for an absolute return of 10% to 20% per year with minimal turnover. In its latest 13F filing for the first quarter of 2023, Russo’s hedge fund disclosed $9.6 billion in managed securities, with the top 10 holdings making up 80.64% of the portfolio. During a May 2023 interview with Markets Insider, Russo expressed deep concern over the US government's aggressive borrowing and the potential long-term impact on Americans. In January 2023, the US government surpassed its borrowing limit of $31.4 trillion, and if an agreement isn't reached to raise the debt ceiling, it could face a cash shortage by June. However, even if the deadlock is resolved, there will still be a significant amount of debt that future generations will have to deal with, according to Russo. The current banking turmoil is driven, in part, by rate hikes which are negatively affecting bond prices. This situation has elicited fears that nervous lenders might pull back, leading to a credit crunch. Nevertheless, Tom Russo argued that concerns about the economy collapsing and lending drying up might be exaggerated. He pointed out that there is an abundance of cash in the system, which has kept stock prices relatively high despite the prevailing headwinds. Additionally, there are asset-price bubbles in various industries that remain a cause for caution.Story continuesAs of the first quarter of 2023, Tom Russo's largest holding is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), where he owns 2,579 shares valued at $1.20 billion. At the end of February 2023, Tom Russo joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio, and the significance of compounding. In 1982, Russo was introduced to Warren Buffett, and at that time, Berkshire Hathaway shares were priced at around $5.00 to $7.00 per share. Since then, the compound return on the investment has been an impressive 19.5%, making it a rewarding wait, as per Russo. He noted that a key principle at Berkshire is to send money to Omaha, where Warren Buffett and other skilled investors can direct its use. Berkshire's subsidiary businesses excel in their respective fields, but they don't always need constant reinvestment. By centralizing the capital in Omaha, the experienced investors can decide how to deploy it best. This approach ensures a steady and strong pace of growth and prevents operating managers from making potential investment mistakes outside their core businesses. In a recent interview, Russo outlined that Warren Buffett's investment of over $11 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) over the past 15 months may be a strategic hedge against rising energy costs. With Berkshire Hathaway holding almost a 24% stake in Occidental, the increase in oil prices would lead to higher profits for Occidental, which could help offset rising fuel costs at Buffett's other major businesses like Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF Railway. Russo commended this approach, calling it a clever and unconventional investment, similar to Buffett's previous strategy of utilizing ""float"" from his insurance companies.Don't Miss: Viking Global's Performance, AUM, and Long-Term StocksSimilarly, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), where Russo owns a $899 million stake, announced on July 18 that it has partnered with payments processing company Geidea, which will utilize Mastercard's latest technology to implement BIN ranges, allowing consumers, merchants, and fintechs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to access advanced payment solutions. Starting from July 21, visitors and tourists also have the option to connect their Mastercard accounts with China's renowned mobile payment platforms. This integration enables them to conveniently book taxis, use the subway, and make purchases at numerous outlets across the cashless nation. This development represents a renewed initiative by Alipay and WeChat Pay to accommodate foreign credit cards, following their earlier limited access attempts in late 2019.Investors who seek guidance from popular Wall Street hedge fund managers can check out some of the best stocks in Tom Russo’s portfolio as of Q1 2023, which include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Our MethodologyTo compile our list of Tom Russo’s top 10 stocks, we used his hedge fund’s 13F filings for the first quarter of 2023. The following list is ranked according to Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn’s stake value in each company. Tom Russo Net Worth, Performance and PortfolioSource: unsplashTom Russo Net Worth, Performance and Portfolio10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn’s Stake Value: $368,144,524Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is an entertainment services provider.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q2 GAAP EPS of $3.29, beating Wall Street estimates by $0.44. However, the revenue of $8.19 billion fell short of market consensus by $100 million. The growth in revenue was fueled by a 6% rise in average paid membership, and there was an addition of 5.89 million global streaming paid memberships during the quarter, bringing the total to 238.39 million.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 108 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 117 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.26 million shares worth approximately $1.5 billion. In addition to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the top stock picks of Tom Russo. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Delivering performance through fundamental, bottom-up stock selection has been a constant over our tenure managing the Strategy. We underperformed in the first half of 2022 from being too early in entering several stocks going through negative earnings revisions and have seen relative results rebound over the last 12 months due to better stock picking, especially among earnings reset names such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms.”9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Gardner Russo &amp; Quinn’s Stake Value: $506,886,095Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

After the deal is finalized, Berkshire Hathaway Energy will hold a 75% stake in the facility, while Brookfield Infrastructure Partners will retain a 25% interest.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 108 hedge funds were bullish on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 20 million shares worth $6 billion. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Berkshire Hathaway is our oldest position. We have held it for almost 11 years, and it has been our largest position for most of that time. We have told you so much about Berkshire through the years that it is difficult not to repeat ourselves.BRK is our core investment, and I would describe our view on the company this way: If I had to invest all my money in a single stock and could not touch it at all for 5–10 years, then I would choose BRK without any hesitation. It is a conglomerate consisting of individual investments the quality of which is well above average, with efficiency in capital allocation that is far above average, having an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, and with very low business risk.All this comes at a valuation that is significantly below the market average. BRK’s earnings power, the determination of which requires a thorough understanding of its business and a good bit of manual labor, is somewhere just north of USD 50 billion a year. Therefore, the entire company, with its market capitalisation of USD 590 billion, trades at less than 12 times annual earnings. It is very realistic to expect BRK’s stock price to grow at an average rate of about 10% per year over the long term…” (Click here to see the full text)8. Philip Morris International Inc.

Revenues are anticipated between $2.890 billion and $2.950 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 6-8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.93 billion, indicating a fall of 6.69% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for earnings has remained at 67 cents per share over the past 30 days, suggesting a 10.67% decline from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Amphenol’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.4%.Amphenol Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseAmphenol Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseAmphenol Corporation price-eps-surprise | Amphenol Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement:Factors to ConsiderAmphenol’s second-quarter top-line growth is expected to have suffered from reduced demand in the communications market. The top line is expected to reflect excess inventory pile-up in the IT datacom market, which has hurt demand. Moreover, cautious spending by service providers is likely to have hurt mobile networks market growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Communications Solutions accounted for 37.9% of Amphenol’s first-quarter 2023 revenues. Our model estimate for second-quarter Communications Solutions revenues is pegged at $1.26 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 8.6%.The company’s other two segments — Harsh Environment Solutions and Interconnect and Sensor Systems — contributed 28.7% and 33.4%, respectively, to first-quarter revenues.Harsh Environment Solutions revenues are estimated to decline 5% year over year to $750.6 million in the second quarter, per our model. Interconnect and Sensor Systems are estimated to decline 5.3% year over year.Nevertheless, Amphenol’s diversified business model lowers the risks posed by the volatility of individual end markets and geographies.Contributions from the acquisitions of Control Measure Regulation Group, Integrated Cable Assembly Holdings, NPI Solutions, MTS Sensors, Halo, Positronic, El-Cab, Unlimited Services, Cablecon and Euromicron are expected to have aided its second-quarter results.Moreover, acquisitions have expanded its high technology and value-added interconnect product offerings in the diversified industrial market.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

While the median asking rent in the 50 largest metros increased to $1,745, up by $7 from last month, it was down $31 from its July 2022 peak.""The downward trend in rent prices continued in June, providing a much-needed respite for renters and an opportunity to regain some control over their housing expenses,"" said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""With our midyear forecast update calling for slowing inflation, better-than-expected labor market performance, and an increase in multi-family supply, we're seeing some encouraging signs for renters' budgets as we enter the second half of the year.""June marks the first year-over-year decrease in rent for one-bedroom units since 2020, mirroring the first such drop in rent for two-bedroom units in May.While continuing rent price declines are helping to improve affordability, it's important to note that rents remain significantly elevated: 24.1% higher than the same time in 2019. Rents for studios, for example, also continue to grow. The median rent of studios was $1,445, up by $14 (1.0%) year-over-year and $229 (18.8%) higher than four years ago.June 2023 Rental Metrics by Unit Size – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentRent YoYRent Change – June 2019Overall$1,745-1.0 %+24.1 %Studio$1,445+1.0 %+18.8 %1-bed$1,630-0.7 %+24.5 %2-bed$1,945-1.0 %+27.0 %Western rents drop further as San Jose experiences first declineRent in Western metros continues to decline faster than other parts of the country (-3.8% Y/Y). San Jose, the last large western metro to show a decline in rental prices, saw its first year-over-year rent drop in nearly two years (-1.4%). In contrast, rents in northeastern hubs such as New York City (+4.7%) and Boston (+2.5%) continued to climb more quickly. The strong labor market in the Northeast is likely driving demand, although increasing supply may help ease the upward pressure on rent prices. Rents in the Midwest are still climbing (+3.2%), due to greater affordability in the region. Of the Top 10 metros experiencing the most rent growth, half are located in the Midwest. Meanwhile, rents in the South (-1.3%) dropped lower than a year ago.Story continuesYoungest metros offer affordability, tech jobsAffordable rent and job prospects are key factors for young people choosing a place to live. Of the 10 metros with the highest share of young households and young renters (aged 25-34), Oklahoma City ranks as the most affordable, with younger individuals spending only 18.7% of their monthly income on the typical rental during June. This age group, which makes up 30% of employees in the tech sector, according to our estimation from the Current Population Survey, is renting in areas with high tech growth, suggesting that tech jobs hold considerable appeal for young households. Six of the metros with the highest share of young renters also had higher-than-average annual growth in their tech sectors (+0.8%). Nine of the 10 experienced positive growth rates overall, led by Seattle (+3.9%), Orlando, Fla. (+2.8%), and Denver (+2.2%).Metros with Highest Share of Young Renter Households in June (Aged 25-34)RankMetrosShare of 25-34 RentersMedian Rent %. of Income Spent on Rent25-34 Tech Sector Annual Growth Rate (2019-2021)1Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO30.5 %$1,98426.7 %2.2 %2Nashville-Davidson et al, TN29.7 %$1,67827.8 %0.2 %3Columbus, OH29.4 %$1,21119.7 %1.1 %4Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA29.3 %$2,14224.8 %3.9 %5Virginia Beach et al, VA-NC28.9 %$1,43825.0 %-2.2 %6Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL27.6 %$1,76232.8 %2.8 %7Austin-Round Rock, TX27.5 %$1,68623.9 %1.1 %8San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX27.3 %$1,29723.7 %0.7 %9Oklahoma City, OK27.3 %$1,02518.7 %1.5 %10Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, IN27.2 %$1,35024.1 %0.7 %Top 50 Average25.5 %$1,74527.0 %0.8 %""The continuing declines in rental prices mark a promising shift for renters after months where many renters spent more than they could afford on housing costs,"" said Realtor.com® Economist Jiayi Xu.

Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). We use rental sources that reliably report data each month within the top 50 largest metropolitan areas. Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.With the release of its June rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since June 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including releases about historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.We define young households and young renters as those aged between 25-34 years old. We exclude renters aged below 25 years old to minimize the impact of college renters. To calculate the share of annual income spent on rents for households aged between 25-34, we used the annual median household income data sourced from Claritas.We leverage Brookings' definition and define the technology sector as six industries from 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS): Computer and Equipment Manufacturing (3341), Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing (3344), Software Publishers (5112), Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services (5182), Other Information Services (5191), and Computer System Design and Related Services (5415). With this definition, we calculated the share of tech labor by age using the 2022 Current Population Survey. The compound annual growth rate for the tech sector is calculated based on the number of employees in the technology industry sourced from 2019 and 2021 County Business Patterns data.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for KLA What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.98bUS$2.99bUS$3.54bUS$4.27bUS$4.68bUS$5.02bUS$5.31bUS$5.56bUS$5.78bUS$5.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 9.62%Est @ 7.37%Est @ 5.79%Est @ 4.69%Est @ 3.91%Est @ 3.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$2.7kUS$2.5kUS$2.7kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$76bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$76b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$29bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$56b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$459, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at KLA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.344. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for KLAStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

This decrease was primarily due to reduced wireless equipment revenue and lower postpaid phone upgrade activity.Total wireless service revenue3 in second-quarter 2023 increased 3.8 percent year over year. This increase was driven primarily by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and a growing contribution from fixed wireless offerings.Net income of $4.8 billion, a decrease of 10.3 percent compared to second-quarter 2022, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA1 of $12.0 billion, an increase of 0.8 percent year over year.First-half 2023 cash flow from operations totaled $18.0 billion, an increase from $17.7 billion in first-half 2022.

At the end of second-quarter 2023, Verizon's ratio of unsecured debt to net income (LTM) was approximately 6.1 times, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio1 was approximately 2.6 times.Verizon Consumer resultsTotal Verizon Consumer revenue was $24.6 billion, a decrease of 4.1 percent year over year. Growth in service and other revenue was offset by wireless equipment revenue declines.Wireless service revenue increased 3.5 percent year over year. This increase was driven by growth in retail postpaid Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA), partially offset by a decline in retail postpaid phone connections and prepaid connections.Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95 percent in second-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.76 percent.In second-quarter 2023, Consumer reported 136,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses.

Segment EBITDA1 in second-quarter 2023 was $10.6 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent year over year. This improvement can be attributed to service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Segment EBITDA margin1 was 43.1 percent, an increase from 40.5 percent in second-quarter 2022.Verizon Business resultsTotal Verizon Business revenue was $7.5 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 1.9 percent year over year. Growth in wireless service revenue was more than offset by lower wireline revenue and lower wireless equipment revenue.Business wireless service revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 5.3 percent year over year. This growth was driven by continued strong net additions and pricing actions implemented in recent quarters.Business reported 308,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in second-quarter 2023, including 144,000 postpaid phone net additions. This was the eighth consecutive quarter that Business reported more than 125,000 postpaid phone net additions.Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48 percent in second-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.10 percent.Business reported 133,000 fixed wireless net additions in second-quarter 2023.In second-quarter 2023, Verizon Business operating income was $533 million, a decrease of 21.0 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 7.1 percent, a decrease from 8.9 percent in second-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA1 was $1.6 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 6.5 percent year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin wireline revenues.

The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $1.95 per share, indicating a 21.1% deterioration year over year.Factors to NoteWest Pharmaceutical’s Proprietary Products was an important contributor to the company’s top-line growth in the first quarter. The segment is likely to have exhibited sustained strength in the second quarter as well.Apart from this, the company is also expected to have witnessed margin expansion in the aforementioned segment. This is due to a favorable mix of products sold (stemming from high-value products’ [HVP] demand), production efficiencies and higher sales price.WST has been witnessing a strong uptake of HVP components, which include Westar, Envision and NovaPure offerings. This trend is likely to have continued in the quarter to be reported.The company has been making significant efforts to retain customers’ faith amid the uncertainty triggered by COVID-19. Apart from ensuring the safety and well-being of team members worldwide, it has successfully continued to manufacture and supply products to its customers. These initiatives might have favored WST’s second-quarter performance.Although the top line declined during the first quarter, demand growth and a strong order book for 2023 are encouraging. The company’s better-than-expected revenue outlook is likely to get reflected in the second-quarter results.West Pharmaceuticals’ business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which is likely to have adversely impacted its second-quarter performance.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Genuine Parts'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Genuine Parts How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Genuine Parts is:30% = US$1.2b ÷ US$4.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Genuine Parts' Earnings Growth And 30% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Genuine Parts has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 20% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Genuine Parts' moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Genuine Parts' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 22% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GPC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Genuine Parts Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 52% (or a retention ratio of 48%) for Genuine Parts suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Genuine Parts has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 46%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Genuine Parts' future ROE will be 31% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Genuine Parts has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

300,f0475b6f-072d-3e3e-bb91-036ed768ab84,DIS,2023-07-25,Hollywood strikes could cost economy $4 billion: Strategist,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-strikes-could-cost-economy-202249744.html,1690230169,VIDEO,"['AMC', 'NFLX', 'CMCSA', 'IMAX', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'WBD', 'DIS']","[Hollywood actors and writers are teaming up on the picket line for the first time since 1960. Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden claims the strikes could cost the economy as much as $4 billion. Klowden explains how the Milken Institute studied a variety of businesses that support the entertainment industry and found that the strike was ""impacting all sorts of things in daily life that you don't think about."" Klowden details that the longer-term impacts of the conflict could affect local businesses nationwide, such as hotels, dry cleaners, restaurants, and many others.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Hollywood actors and writers are back out on the picket lines today for the second week of a historic double strike. Our next guest says the work stoppage could result in a $4 billion hit to the economy, and it won't just be limited to Hollywood. Let's bring in Kevin Klowden. He's a chief global strategist at the Milken Institute.And Kevin, that $4 billion number you have put out has really been shared widely because when you think about the impact here, we're not talking just about studios, not just the content space, but much broader than that. How do you break down that $4 billion?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, what you look at is start with what happened back in the 2007/2008 strike. And when we looked at that and we did the analysis a number of years ago on it, we found that it was an impact in California. That number was really about what was going on when the industry was way more concentrated in California than it even is now.And we saw it impacting all sorts of things in daily life you don't think about. We looked at it and we talk to people, and it was affecting restaurants and catering companies. It was affecting trucking companies, it was affecting welders, it was affecting construction people, it was affecting dry cleaners, it was affecting all sorts of businesses in hospitality and otherwise.And what you realize is that and a strike like this, especially as it's expanded as it's not just the writers this time with the actors, it's a total stoppage and almost everything that's scripted that it's not just impacting these industries in California. But it's really doing so in New York, it's doing it in Atlanta. It's doing it in Albuquerque, it's doing it in Pittsburgh. It's doing it in all sorts of places where filming actually takes place.Story continuesAnd we think of Hollywood as this great center, but it's because of film incentives and because of the way that the industry works, a huge amount of that filming is scattered all over that country. And that means that the economic impacts aren't just in California, but they're elsewhere.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Kevin, it's worth noting that $4 billion number, that would be double the damage caused from the last strike which happened in 2007 with the writers. And I'm curious to get your perspective, given how far apart the unions seem to be from the studios, how long could this go, and who do you think will be first to cave?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, I think ultimately, both sides will have to cave. And the problem is, you have to get to that point. Right now, it doesn't seem like either side is ready to. The studios think that they can outlast the writers and the actors because they'll undergo economic pressures, they'll have rent payments, mortgage payments, basic utilities, cost of life issues.And the actors and the writers think that the studios are going to run into issues with content. And it really depends for each of them who will be under the biggest amount of pressure. Netflix likes to say, hey, we've got enough that we can last into next year. But Netflix is just streaming, and they do have other things they can bring in.The question is, as they bring in international content like they did during the pandemic, do they start bleeding out subscribers? They've been adding them recently, especially with some of the moves they've made. But what happens if they take a hit? What happens if the studios don't have enough for the networks? What if they don't have enough for their fall slots? And all of those are issues that are going to come in.And right now, nobody's really in a great position coming out of the damage from the pandemic, coming out of the issues that have been placed in this. And the uncertainty around revenue on streaming. Everybody's in a precarious position. Nobody really wanted the strike. But at the same time, both sides see the current situation as not viable.AKIKO FUJITA: And Kevin, you have to wonder the longer this goes on, whether there's going to be some kind of division between what we like to think is more of the tech-facing companies like an Apple or a Netflix, and then the traditional studios like a WarnerMedia as well as Paramount. I want to get back to that number, the 4 billion number that you mentioned. If you think about SAG-AFTRA, you think about WGA, they've obviously got funds that are helping support some members.There's the below the line-- what's described as below the line, I should say-- the craft services, others who are all part of that team that goes into movies. What do you anticipate the impact there to be? If we're talking restaurants, for example, that are fundamentally supported by some of these shoots, I mean, what's going to happen there? How do you assess the economic impact on that front?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, unfortunately, you have to watch and wait. That's part of what we're looking at when we're estimating an impact is that last time around-- and this is a number of years ago before we had a whole bunch of inflation and other issues. But when we were estimating it, we had to look at things on, did it impact rentals of apartments?Did it impact business closures? How many people got laid off in hospitality? How many people got laid off in other secondary businesses? What kind of longer term impacts do you actually wind up seeing? And unfortunately, that data is lagging. So we're only guessing a very educated guess. But we're still trying to sort that out.The longer this goes on, the more that a number of these businesses who were already hit by the pandemic and having to stay closed or only have to deal with customers coming in doing takeaway if you're a restaurant or even if you're a dry cleaner, whether there's very limited activity or anything else. Those kinds of pressures are already there.So a number of these businesses may be more cash-poor than they might have been otherwise. And so we're watching and waiting to see, do they operate by basically reducing the number of employees? Do they operate by potentially shutting down a number of days? Or are they not able to make rent?And let alone, you have a number of real estate companies who had gone in, who had bought studio spaces because the increase in the amount of filming, they've invested heavily in this industry, not just in California, but all over the country. How much do they get hit? How much do investors get hit? How much does all of these secondary groups get hit.And meanwhile, you have a whole bunch of content creators who are like, well, I can just go on YouTube or TikTok, I can film from my own personal camera, do something to see if they can find alternate ways. And for the below the line people in particular, there are a lot of people we found in the last strike where they left.We found it took a year for the industry to recover because a lot of people basically were like, I can't make ends meet. This is too much. They moved, they go into different jobs, other things happen, let alone all the delays in filming.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Kevin, speaking of businesses that were hard hit by the pandemic, I want to talk about the theater chains because Moody's was out with a new report last week saying that movie theaters will be hardest hit by the double strike the longer it goes on considering their reliance on new content. Do you agree with that? And what do you think it could mean for the future of the box office?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the future of the box office has already been hit. If you looked at it pre-pandemic, you were already seeing a declining number of people going to the movies except for events, for things that they were particularly motivated by like ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" and what this means now is if you don't have those polls to get people into the theaters, they're going to have to rely on coming up with various alternatives that try and draw people in. But nothing brings people in like a new release. And the movie theater chains already were hit very hard during the pandemic because they were shut down in a number of different parts of the country for extended periods. So for them, this could be even more of a make or break moment, especially if the content disappears for an extended stretch of a few months.AKIKO FUJITA: The Milken Institute's Kevin Klowden, good to get your insights. We'll continue to follow the strike to see where things go. Appreciate the insight today.KEVIN KLOWDEN: My pleasure.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this entertainment company have returned -1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, to which Disney belongs, has lost 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.01 per share, indicating a change of -7.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.2%. This estimate has changed -2.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.12 indicates a change of +36.5% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Disney.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $89.4 billion and $94.21 billion estimates indicate +8.1% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $21.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.3%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.03%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The ComEd EV Rally is designed to prepare the next generation of the clean energy workforce, while simultaneously helping bridge the gender gap in STEM.The 45 students are working with female ComEd mentors over four build days to assemble high-tech, electric go-karts while learning about a variety of career opportunities in STEM. The program culminates on Saturday, July 29 at noon, when the girls race their completed cars at the Museum of Science and Industry.""This exciting program is a fun way for teens to get out of the classroom and experience STEM in a hands-on environment surrounded by like-minded peers,"" said Michelle Blaise, senior vice president of technical services at ComEd. ""The clean energy transition is coming quickly, and ComEd is working to ensure that we have a diverse pipeline of talent ready to fill these new roles and support the evolving needs of our communities.""Young women between the ages of 13 and 18, were eligible to apply for the program; the 45 participating students will receive a $2,000 scholarship upon completion of the program.To inspire even more young people by the power of STEM, ComEd is giving away 500 tickets to the Museum of Science and Industry for young girls and their families to use on race day. Information on how to receive tickets can be found at ComEdEVRally.com.While the 2023 EV Rally ends on race day, this program will have a much longer impact on its participants, many of whom continue to earn opportunities through ComEd and its parent company, Exelon. Young women who have previously participated in EV Rally and Icebox Derby, the program that the EV Rally has replaced, have gone on to participate in a variety of ComEd and Exelon programs resulting in additional mentorships, scholarships and internships.Story continuesEliana De Bates-Aguiñaga, a rising sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying engineering, participated in the 2022 EV Rally and has since been the recipient of two ComEd Future of Energy Scholarships to help fund her college education.""I am so lucky to have participated in the ComEd EV Rally. I learned more about STEM and engineering careers and bonded with girls who were also interested in science and math,"" said De Bates. ""Since that program, ComEd has been so generous to help with my continued education, and I look forward to working in the energy industry alongside my mentors in the coming years.""Teegan Mathey, a rising junior at the University of Alabama studying environmental science, participated in the 2019 Icebox Derby. Following her time in the program, she has also attended the Exelon STEM Academy, received the 2021 Exelon STEM Leadership Academy Scholarship and held three internships with ComEd.""During the ComEd Icebox Derby, I was able to build connections, make meaningful friendships and use those connections to land my first internship at ComEd,"" said Mathey. ""My ComEd internships have helped me learn about the energy industry and shown me that I can have a future in the industry as a woman in a male-dominated field.""Eden Wilson, a rising senior at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, participated in the 2022 EV Rally. Since last summer, Wilson has also participated in ComEd’s Black History Month and Women’s History Month STEM Labs and the Exelon STEM Academy.""ComEd has been really helpful in my STEM journey so far, especially when it comes to representation. Programs like EV Rally and the STEM Academy connected me with inspiring Black women who have careers in computer science and engineering,"" said Wilson. ""Another aspect of the programs I’ve enjoyed are the friendships I’ve made and the people I’ve met who have similar STEM interests to me.""Encouraging young women to pursue STEM careers will be crucial for the clean energy future. A recent, ComEd-commissioned study revealed that the clean energy transition could bring as many as 150,000 jobs to Illinois by 2050. Additional studies by the Illinois Science &amp; Technology Coalition have found that while women make up 50 percent of the workforce, they only hold 27 percent of jobs in STEM-related fields in Illinois.ComEd is committed to increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce. By educating the next generation on the importance of zero-emissions vehicles and clean energy solutions, diverse young women may be inspired to seek out job opportunities in clean energy industries. Participants in the 2023 EV Rally come from diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds, and this year’s application review process prioritized students from equity investment eligible communities—or EIECs, as defined by the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in Illinois. This year, two thirds of the EV Rally participants come from EIECs.The EV Rally is one example of how ComEd is preparing more students to become leaders in the clean-energy transition. Additional STEM and scholarship programs include STEM Labs, Power of STEM, Future of Energy Scholarships and Drop Me In. These programs focus on giving diverse groups of young students exposure to the possibilities of STEM.Find out more about the program by visiting ComEdEVRally.com.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

Proxy materials are expected to be mailed on or about July 28, 2023.As previously announced on May 14, 2023, ONEOK will acquire all outstanding units of Magellan in a cash-and-stock transaction consisting of $25.00 in cash and 0.667 shares of ONEOK common stock for each outstanding Magellan common unit.The combination of ONEOK and Magellan will create a diversified North American midstream infrastructure company with predominately fee-based earnings, a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility focused on delivering essential energy products and services to its customers, and continued strong returns to investors.Highlights of the transaction include: Brings together two premier energy infrastructure businesses with strong returns on invested capital and diverse free cash flow generation: The transaction adds a leading, and primarily fee-based, refined products and crude oil transportation business to ONEOK. Magellan's stable, primarily demand-driven businesses are expected to generate significant free cash flow due to low capital expenditure requirements. This acquisition creates a more resilient energy infrastructure company that is expected to produce stable cash flows through diverse commodity cycles.Compelling long-term value proposition driven by consistent and disciplined capital allocation philosophy: The combined company is expected to experience a step change in free cash flow after dividends and growth capital by generating an average annual amount of approximately $1.0 billion in the first four years following the expected transaction close. The increase in free cash flow will provide additional cash for debt reduction, growth capital and value returned to shareholders through dividends and/or repurchasing shares. ONEOK remains committed to growing both EPS and its common dividend while targeting a payout ratio of less than 85%.Expect to achieve immediate financial benefits, including cost, operational and tax synergies, supporting meaningful expected accretion: The transaction is expected to be earnings per share (EPS) accretive beginning in 2024 with EPS accretion of 3% to 7% per year from 2025 through 2027, and free cash flow per share accretion averaging more than 20% from 2024 through 2027. Base forecasted synergies are expected to total at least $200 million annually.Story continuesFrom a tax perspective, ONEOK expects to benefit from the step-up in Magellan's tax basis from the transaction, thus deferring the expected impact of the new corporate alternative minimum tax from 2024 to 2027. The benefit from the basis step-up has an estimated total value of approximately $3.0 billion, which has an estimated net present value of approximately $1.5 billion. Utilization of expected tax attributes could increase if additional capital projects are put into service or acquisitions are completed, which may increase the net present value of future tax deferrals.Complementary and diversified asset positions with potential for additional cost and commercial synergies over time: The combined company will own more than 25,000 miles of liquids-oriented pipelines, with significant assets and operational expertise at the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent market hubs. ONEOK anticipates this combined liquids-focused portfolio will present significant potential for enhanced customer product offerings and increased international export opportunities. We believe these activities could potentially result in total annual transaction synergies exceeding $400 million within two to four years.Strong investment-grade credit ratings with enhanced scale and diversification: The combined company expects pro-forma 2024 year-end net debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 4.0 times. ONEOK expects leverage to decrease below 3.5 times by 2026 as future growth projects are placed in service. Excluding certain large projects that have not yet received a final investment decision from the expected net debt-to-EBITDA calculation would accelerate the timeframe to achieve 3.5 times by approximately one year.On June 27, 2023, ONEOK announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to approval by both ONEOK shareholders and Magellan unitholders, and other customary closing conditions.ONEOK shareholders who need assistance voting or have questions regarding the Special Meeting may contact ONEOK's proxy solicitor:Innisfree M&amp;A Incorporated:Shareholders may call toll free: 877-750-9499Banks and Brokers may call collect: 212-750-5833ONEOK, Inc.

(NYSE: MMP) (""Magellan"") today commented on a report regarding Magellan's pending merger with ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) (""ONEOK"") written by Robert Willens, an independent expert and specialist in interpreting tax and accounting issues and their effects on corporate capital transactions, mergers &amp; acquisitions, private investments, real estate and REITs. The report is available at MaximizingValueforMMPunitholders.com.Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (PRNewsFoto/Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.) (PRNewsFoto/)""The Willens report validates the unanimous determination of the Magellan board of directors that – even after taking the impact of taxes into account – the pending ONEOK transaction maximizes value and is in the best interest of Magellan and our unitholders,"" said Aaron Milford, Magellan's chief executive officer.  ""We asked Robert Willens to prepare this report because he is widely recognized as a leading expert in assessing the impact of taxes on M&amp;A transactions. His report supports our view that the benefits of the pending transaction with ONEOK for Magellan unitholders far outweigh the tax costs.""Milford added, ""The transaction delivers a significant upfront premium of 22%1 and a sector-leading multiple of 12.3x EBITDA2, and allows Magellan unitholders to participate in the future upside of a stronger and more diversified company. Our board and leadership team are confident this transaction maximizes value for unitholders and urge all unitholders to vote 'FOR' the transaction in advance of the scheduled special meeting.""In his July 10, 2023 report, Robert Willens noted:""In the final analysis, this transaction has, when viewed as an integrated whole, a remarkably favorable tax profile. When a valid comparison is made of the tax benefits of the transaction to the relatively modest tax cost the deal engenders, it is abundantly clear that such benefits greatly outweigh such costs.""""… this transaction does not create tax liabilities for MMP's unitholders. Those liabilities were always present. Instead, this transaction simply accelerates their payment; and [ONEOK] has provided the unitholders with the means, through the Cash Consideration… to meet those obligations.""""The Cash Consideration manifests an unusual sensitivity and solicitude, on [ONEOK]'s part, to the tax consequences of the transaction to [Magellan]'s unit holders by providing them with the liquidity they will need to defray their tax liabilities.""""As is typically the case, acquirers whose acquisitions are structured to achieve a basis step up, share that largesse with the owners of the acquired entity in the form of an increased purchase price for the acquired entity. In fact, here, an unquantifiable, but undoubtedly substantial, portion of the ""premium"" [ONEOK] is offering in the transaction is directly attributable to the tax savings [ONEOK] will reap from the basis step up…it would become readily apparent that the benefits of the 'step up' substantially outweigh the true 'cost' borne by the unit holders from accelerating a tax liability that would, inevitably, have to be shouldered.""Story continuesMr. Willens' reports are used by hedge fund managers, lawyers, accountants, arbitrageurs, corporate tax directors, university professors and others assessing the complex tax impacts of transactions. The report, which was commissioned by Magellan, reflects Mr. Willens' personal views and is based solely on publicly available information.Magellan's board of directors unanimously recommends that unitholders vote ""FOR"" the pending merger.

""The benefits far outweigh that (tax) cost,"" he saidUnder the deal in which ONEOK will also assume Magellan's debt, ONEOK will pay $25 and 0.6670 shares of ONEOK common stock for each outstanding Magellan common unit, representing a premium of 22% to Magellan's closing price on May 12.Milford said Magellan investors would also benefit from the combined company's increased scale, product diversification, and annual cost savings of up to $400 million.The vote on the deal is scheduled for Sept. 21.MLPs were designed to promote the production of commodities such as oil and natural gas and the building out of infrastructure facilities, but in recent years they have fallen out of favor with investors in part due to their exclusion from major indexes.Magellan's pipelines move refined petroleum products and crude oil, while ONEOK is focused on transporting natural gas liquids and natural gas.

313,791b4604-8363-3cc5-85e9-62b424a660d8,HP,2023-07-25,Earnings Preview: Transocean (RIG) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-transocean-rig-q2-140032097.html,1690207232,STORY,"['RIG', 'HP']","[The market expects Transocean (RIG) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis offshore oil and gas drilling contractor is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20%.Revenues are expected to be $724.38 million, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Transocean?For Transocean, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.14%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Transocean will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Transocean would post a loss of $0.20 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.38, delivering a surprise of -90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Transocean doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry, Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +229.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $702.05 million, up 27.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Helmerich &amp; Payne has been revised 6.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.46%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Helmerich &amp; Payne will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to year-ago revenues of $674.49 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.F5 shares have added about 3.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.2%.What's Next for F5?While F5 has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for F5: unfavorable.

These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations, and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets, facility-exit costs, acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, restructuring charges, and certain non-recurring tax expenses and benefits, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the Company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the Company’s tax liability.The non-GAAP adjustments, and F5's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation consists of expense for stock options, restricted stock, and employee stock purchases through the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of F5’s employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of the Company’s core business and to facilitate comparison of the Company’s results to those of peer companies.Amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. On a non-recurring basis, when certain events or circumstances are present, management may also be required to write down the carrying value of its purchased intangible assets and recognize impairment charges. Management does not believe these charges accurately reflect the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations; therefore, they are not considered by management in making operating decisions. However, investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to F5’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to F5’s future period revenues as well.Facility-exit costs. F5 has incurred charges in connection with the exit of facilities as well as other non-recurring lease activity. These charges are not representative of ongoing costs to the business and are not expected to recur. As a result, these charges are being excluded to provide investors with a more comparable measure of costs associated with ongoing operations.Acquisition-related charges, net. F5 does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms and scope of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction. F5 excludes acquisition-related charges from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of the Company’s operating results to prior periods and to its peer companies. Acquisition-related charges consist of planning, execution and integration costs incurred directly as a result of an acquisition.Restructuring charges. F5 has incurred restructuring charges that are included in its GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and costs associated with exiting facility-lease commitments. F5 excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the Company’s core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results. Although F5’s management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management’s reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5’s earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5’s management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measures of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business and is used by management in its own evaluation of the Company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the Company provides investors these supplemental measures since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the Company’s operational performance and financial results.For reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section in our attached Condensed Consolidated Income Statements entitled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures.""About F5F5 is a multi-cloud application services and security company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.​​​​​​​ F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to secure and optimize apps and APIs anywhere—on premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in periods of economic downturns, and go directly to read 5 Best Recession Dividend Stocks to Buy. As the stock market bounced back from last year's lows, analysts have differing opinions on the likelihood of a recession happening this year. Bloomberg's July survey of economists revealed higher projections for gross domestic product in the second and third quarters. However, despite the improved outlook, forecasters still believe there is a 60% chance of the US entering a recession within the next year. On the other hand, according to Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25%, down from the previous projection of 35% made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. The report also mentioned that growth in the U.S. is receiving a significant boost from the recovery in real disposable income and stabilization in the housing market.Despite many investors anticipating a recession for a while, the labor market and consumer spending have shown resilience, indicating that a recession may not be imminent. However, investors must be prepared for any potential downturn, as predicting recessions is challenging and uncertain. Investors are advised to focus on prudent industries that are known for their resilience and stability. For example, healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are some sectors that tend to be less sensitive to economic fluctuations, making them potentially safer options for weathering the storm of a recession. Business Insider also published a report that revealed that the consumer staples industry outperformed the market by 49% in 25 years ending 2015, with most of this outperformance occurring during recessionary periods.  Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average was down just 1.4% in 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowDividends are one of the reasons why these industries perform better than others during a recession. The nature of their businesses, which provide essential goods and services, often results in relatively predictable cash flows and revenue streams. This stability allows them to maintain their dividend policies with more confidence, even during economic downturns.Though dividend stocks are not immune to recession, these companies often demonstrate more stability than high-growth or speculative stocks during periods of economic downturn. The performance of dividend stocks in 2022 underscores their significance in any investment portfolio. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats proved to be a reliable defensive strategy last year, especially given that the overall S&amp;P 500 had its worst performance since the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. While the Dividend Aristocrats index also ended the year with losses, it fared much better compared to the broader market. So, even though it wasn't entirely immune to the downturn, it provided a more resilient investment option during a challenging period. Some of the best dividend stocks to consider during a recession include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). In addition to these, we have compiled a list of dividend stocks to buy in case of a recession.11 Best Recession Dividend Stocks to BuyPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this article, we used Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and identified dividend stocks from industries that are known to be recession-proof, such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities. From that list, we selected dividend stocks that have consistently increased their payouts for over 10 years and currently offer yields above 2%, as of July 24. Finally, we shortlisted 11 dividend stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors tracked by Insider Monkey as of Q1 2023.11. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 Dividend Yield as of July 24: 7.45%Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.7 billion, indicating a rise of about 3.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at 74 cents per share, suggesting growth of 2.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings of 73 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 1.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Key Aspects to NoteColgate is anticipated to have benefited from solid consumer demand for personal care, hygiene and home care products. Colgate’s focus on innovation, premiumization and digital transformation, along with its brand strength, are likely to have driven its performance in the second quarter. The company’s top line is also likely to have benefited from its effective pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans.Colgate’s focus on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations has been proving beneficial. Of late, the performance of its premium innovation products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, has been impressive. This is expected to have boosted organic sales growth for its Oral Care business in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for the company’s organic sales growth is pegged at 4.7% for the second quarter.Solid momentum in the Hill's business is expected to have delivered sales growth in the second quarter. Strength in Hill's Prescription Diet and Hill's Science Diet has been aiding the segment’s sales. The company’s Prescription Diet Derm Complete brand has been gaining market share, which is likely to have augmented sales in the second quarter. We anticipate Colgate’s gross margin to expand year-over-year by 10 basis points in the second quarter.The leading global consumer products company has been aggressively expanding into faster growth channels while extending the geographic footprint of its brands. The company’s efforts to improve product availability through enhanced distribution across existing and new markets are likely to have driven its top-line performance. Higher e-commerce demand for its products is also likely to have augmented its sales in the second quarter.However, higher raw material and packaging material costs have been concerning, despite sales growth. The company has been witnessing a deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses, which have been weighing on margins. Higher costs and expenses are expected to have hurt the bottom line’s performance in the second quarter. Our model indicates about a 1% increase in SG&amp;A expenses in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.Although Colgate’s expansionary efforts into new markets bode well for its long-term growth, it might affect its margins and profitability in the second quarter. For instance, higher costs associated with advertisements and integration costs related to the company’s three Red Collar facilities and the Italian facility are expected to have hurt its margins and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, given the company’s substantial international operations, foreign-currency woes might have hurt its top line in the second quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Colgate this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

The segment is likely to have exhibited sustained strength in the second quarter as well.Apart from this, the company is also expected to have witnessed margin expansion in the aforementioned segment. This is due to a favorable mix of products sold (stemming from high-value products’ [HVP] demand), production efficiencies and higher sales price.WST has been witnessing a strong uptake of HVP components, which include Westar, Envision and NovaPure offerings. This trend is likely to have continued in the quarter to be reported.The company has been making significant efforts to retain customers’ faith amid the uncertainty triggered by COVID-19. Apart from ensuring the safety and well-being of team members worldwide, it has successfully continued to manufacture and supply products to its customers. These initiatives might have favored WST’s second-quarter performance.Although the top line declined during the first quarter, demand growth and a strong order book for 2023 are encouraging. The company’s better-than-expected revenue outlook is likely to get reflected in the second-quarter results.West Pharmaceuticals’ business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which is likely to have adversely impacted its second-quarter performance.

325,f0475b6f-072d-3e3e-bb91-036ed768ab84,CMCSA,2023-07-25,Hollywood strikes could cost economy $4 billion: Strategist,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-strikes-could-cost-economy-202249744.html,1690230169,VIDEO,"['AMC', 'NFLX', 'CMCSA', 'IMAX', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'WBD', 'DIS']","[Hollywood actors and writers are teaming up on the picket line for the first time since 1960. Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden claims the strikes could cost the economy as much as $4 billion. Klowden explains how the Milken Institute studied a variety of businesses that support the entertainment industry and found that the strike was ""impacting all sorts of things in daily life that you don't think about."" Klowden details that the longer-term impacts of the conflict could affect local businesses nationwide, such as hotels, dry cleaners, restaurants, and many others.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Hollywood actors and writers are back out on the picket lines today for the second week of a historic double strike. Our next guest says the work stoppage could result in a $4 billion hit to the economy, and it won't just be limited to Hollywood. Let's bring in Kevin Klowden. He's a chief global strategist at the Milken Institute.And Kevin, that $4 billion number you have put out has really been shared widely because when you think about the impact here, we're not talking just about studios, not just the content space, but much broader than that. How do you break down that $4 billion?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, what you look at is start with what happened back in the 2007/2008 strike. And when we looked at that and we did the analysis a number of years ago on it, we found that it was an impact in California. That number was really about what was going on when the industry was way more concentrated in California than it even is now.And we saw it impacting all sorts of things in daily life you don't think about. We looked at it and we talk to people, and it was affecting restaurants and catering companies. It was affecting trucking companies, it was affecting welders, it was affecting construction people, it was affecting dry cleaners, it was affecting all sorts of businesses in hospitality and otherwise.And what you realize is that and a strike like this, especially as it's expanded as it's not just the writers this time with the actors, it's a total stoppage and almost everything that's scripted that it's not just impacting these industries in California. But it's really doing so in New York, it's doing it in Atlanta. It's doing it in Albuquerque, it's doing it in Pittsburgh. It's doing it in all sorts of places where filming actually takes place.Story continuesAnd we think of Hollywood as this great center, but it's because of film incentives and because of the way that the industry works, a huge amount of that filming is scattered all over that country. And that means that the economic impacts aren't just in California, but they're elsewhere.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Kevin, it's worth noting that $4 billion number, that would be double the damage caused from the last strike which happened in 2007 with the writers. And I'm curious to get your perspective, given how far apart the unions seem to be from the studios, how long could this go, and who do you think will be first to cave?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, I think ultimately, both sides will have to cave. And the problem is, you have to get to that point. Right now, it doesn't seem like either side is ready to. The studios think that they can outlast the writers and the actors because they'll undergo economic pressures, they'll have rent payments, mortgage payments, basic utilities, cost of life issues.And the actors and the writers think that the studios are going to run into issues with content. And it really depends for each of them who will be under the biggest amount of pressure. Netflix likes to say, hey, we've got enough that we can last into next year. But Netflix is just streaming, and they do have other things they can bring in.The question is, as they bring in international content like they did during the pandemic, do they start bleeding out subscribers? They've been adding them recently, especially with some of the moves they've made. But what happens if they take a hit? What happens if the studios don't have enough for the networks? What if they don't have enough for their fall slots? And all of those are issues that are going to come in.And right now, nobody's really in a great position coming out of the damage from the pandemic, coming out of the issues that have been placed in this. And the uncertainty around revenue on streaming. Everybody's in a precarious position. Nobody really wanted the strike. But at the same time, both sides see the current situation as not viable.AKIKO FUJITA: And Kevin, you have to wonder the longer this goes on, whether there's going to be some kind of division between what we like to think is more of the tech-facing companies like an Apple or a Netflix, and then the traditional studios like a WarnerMedia as well as Paramount. I want to get back to that number, the 4 billion number that you mentioned. If you think about SAG-AFTRA, you think about WGA, they've obviously got funds that are helping support some members.There's the below the line-- what's described as below the line, I should say-- the craft services, others who are all part of that team that goes into movies. What do you anticipate the impact there to be? If we're talking restaurants, for example, that are fundamentally supported by some of these shoots, I mean, what's going to happen there? How do you assess the economic impact on that front?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, unfortunately, you have to watch and wait. That's part of what we're looking at when we're estimating an impact is that last time around-- and this is a number of years ago before we had a whole bunch of inflation and other issues. But when we were estimating it, we had to look at things on, did it impact rentals of apartments?Did it impact business closures? How many people got laid off in hospitality? How many people got laid off in other secondary businesses? What kind of longer term impacts do you actually wind up seeing? And unfortunately, that data is lagging. So we're only guessing a very educated guess. But we're still trying to sort that out.The longer this goes on, the more that a number of these businesses who were already hit by the pandemic and having to stay closed or only have to deal with customers coming in doing takeaway if you're a restaurant or even if you're a dry cleaner, whether there's very limited activity or anything else. Those kinds of pressures are already there.So a number of these businesses may be more cash-poor than they might have been otherwise. And so we're watching and waiting to see, do they operate by basically reducing the number of employees? Do they operate by potentially shutting down a number of days? Or are they not able to make rent?And let alone, you have a number of real estate companies who had gone in, who had bought studio spaces because the increase in the amount of filming, they've invested heavily in this industry, not just in California, but all over the country. How much do they get hit? How much do investors get hit? How much does all of these secondary groups get hit.And meanwhile, you have a whole bunch of content creators who are like, well, I can just go on YouTube or TikTok, I can film from my own personal camera, do something to see if they can find alternate ways. And for the below the line people in particular, there are a lot of people we found in the last strike where they left.We found it took a year for the industry to recover because a lot of people basically were like, I can't make ends meet. This is too much. They moved, they go into different jobs, other things happen, let alone all the delays in filming.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Kevin, speaking of businesses that were hard hit by the pandemic, I want to talk about the theater chains because Moody's was out with a new report last week saying that movie theaters will be hardest hit by the double strike the longer it goes on considering their reliance on new content. Do you agree with that? And what do you think it could mean for the future of the box office?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the future of the box office has already been hit. If you looked at it pre-pandemic, you were already seeing a declining number of people going to the movies except for events, for things that they were particularly motivated by like ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer."" and what this means now is if you don't have those polls to get people into the theaters, they're going to have to rely on coming up with various alternatives that try and draw people in. But nothing brings people in like a new release. And the movie theater chains already were hit very hard during the pandemic because they were shut down in a number of different parts of the country for extended periods. So for them, this could be even more of a make or break moment, especially if the content disappears for an extended stretch of a few months.AKIKO FUJITA: The Milken Institute's Kevin Klowden, good to get your insights. We'll continue to follow the strike to see where things go. Appreciate the insight today.KEVIN KLOWDEN: My pleasure.]"

City Controller Kenneth Mejia noted that “outdated laws” limited the penalties that the city could impose. The studio also benefited from this being its first offense, which lowered the fine.Mejia expressed frustration with the amount, saying his office was recommending the city upgrade laws surrounding illegal tree trimmings.“Based on our findings, the system isn’t working as intended,” he wrote.Any change, though, would take time and wouldn’t impact NBCUniversal’s penalty.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

It also broke the record for first weekend box office take for a film directed by a woman. In this case, of course Greta Gerwig.""Yahoo Finance's"" Alexandra Canal is here with the numbers, the details, her review. She's got it all.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Got it all.JULIE HYMAN: What do you got for us?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I was one of many patrons to go see ""Barbie"" over the weekendJULIE HYMAN: Including us.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I know you guys did too. So I'm looking forward to discussing what we think. But ""Barbie"", yes, a really strong performance. It was backed by both Mattel, Warner Brothers, Discovery. Both of those stocks are on the move this morning. ""Barbie"" nabbed a collective $235 million plus at the box office, when you couple that with ""Oppenheimer"", which is a film from Universal.And, overall, this was the fourth strongest weekend that we've ever seen in box office history. And it comes at a very critical time when there's a lot going on in the industry. We have those strikes looming. Moody said that theater chains will be hit first the longer this strike continues. So the fact that we had a really strong performance like this is certainly encouraging heading into the fall, when we're not going to see as many blockbusters or as many talked about movies like ""Barbie"" has.The marketing here was just insane heading into this weekend.BRAD SMITH: It, absolutely, was. There were a few-- and we have all seen this. I saw it yesterday, actually. And walked out of the theater just in awe, but also had these takeaways as I thought about it more this morning. One, ""Barbie"" core wearing moviegoers, they can have the potential to bump some of those retail sales numbers as well from the fashion and the number of people, yourself, myself, I guess, included.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: The Kenough shirt, that apparently is already available.BRAD SMITH: I know.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You can buy it.BRAD SMITH: We were looking at it right before the show started. Yes. Also Mattel, this is probably a one-and-done type of box office moment for them. I can't imagine ""How Wheels"" doing the same type of numbers that ""Barbie"" did at the box office. And ""Hot Wheels"" is rumored to be in production and be coming out in like, 2025, as well here.JULIE HYMAN: The marriage of ""Barbie"" and Greta Gerwig, it does seem difficult that that is replicable with other artistic projects. That this was, at the same time, a commercial and an artistic endeavor.It's a little bit difficult to thread that needle. And the movie did it relatively successfully. We're going to talk with Rick Newman about that a little bit later on. But it's been percolating through my brain as well. I read too much about it going into it. And my expectations were probably too high.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: But, overall, I did like it. I feel like, overall, it tried to do a little too much. As I keep thinking through it, there were amazing moments throughout the film. The theme throughout the film was amazing. But I also think it was a very noisy movie. There was just a lot.It seems like the idea was, if you had an idea, you put it in the movie. And some of the ideas were spectacular. But at the end of the day, I don't know. It was a little bit noisy.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I agree with that, Julie. I do think there were moments where it was a little too cheesy for me, considering the messaging was so strong. And then spoiler alert, but the Ken dancing musical--JULIE HYMAN: That was my favorite.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I feel like for me, I would have been fine. I loved the song.JULIE HYMAN: It had nothing to do with anything.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It had nothing to do with anything.JULIE HYMAN: But it was amazing.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And just to see Ryan Gosling sing, I think he did such a great job. He was Ken to me. And he's such a big movie star. That for a movie star to be able to embody a completely different character like that, I think takes a lot of skill. So I truly enjoyed it. It was entertaining. It was cute. It was fun, silly, at times. I agree with you that there was a lot happening all at once.But the overarching message, I really thought resonated with me.BRAD SMITH: ""Barbie"" as an economic indicator or perhaps a consumer indicator by the time we go into Halloween here. And yeah, we're going to bring them back to the figures for the consumer here too. Is this for investors-- now, as we think about it, is this something that they can continue to ride the wave of? Because if you're going into Halloween and saying, all right, all these people purchased pink. They've got to wear it again. And there's going to be so many--JULIE HYMAN: And maybe buy more stuff from Mattel.BRAD SMITH: --iterations. Buy more stuff.ALEXANDRA CANAL: There's going to be Barbie and Ken's all over for Halloween.BRAD SMITH: And then the holidays.JULIE HYMAN: Forget about it from the adult perspective. Forgive me, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: But Christmas comes after Halloween. And you can't help but think that there's going to be a bump in ""Barbie"" sales of the actual doll, as a result of--ALEXANDRA CANAL: 100%. Yeah. That'll be really interesting to track through the holiday season to see how big of a windfall this is, not just for the box office, but really for Mattel. And we do know that there's going to be other types of movies coming based on their toys.I love the outfits, how they recreated and pointed to the outfits in the movie. I'm sure Rick will talk about this too. It really was a giant commercial.JULIE HYMAN: As we're talking about the kids, one more point, this is not really a movie for little kids. I did see some smaller children in the theater. And some of it is a little sophisticated for them. And some will go right over their heads. Just for--ALEXANDRA CANAL: PG-13.JULIE HYMAN: --parents' FYI.BRAD SMITH: Maybe Allan and Midge get a sequel. Who knows.JULIE HYMAN: Allan, that was--ALEXANDRA CANAL: I know. That was perfect. He's just Ken's buddy at the end of the day.]"

333,993fa1f0-1c84-3117-ac9f-cb0dba9f798a,URI,2023-07-25,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook United Rentals (URI),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-164507125.html,1690217107,STORY,['URI'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends United Rentals (URI) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this equipment rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for United Rentals is 16.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 22.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for United Rentals is 25.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 2.4%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8.8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for United Rentals have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.Bottom LineUnited Rentals has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions United Rentals well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This largest equipment rental company’s first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues grew 38.7% and 30.2% year over year, respectively.Markedly, its earnings surpassed expectations in 33 out of the last 39 quarters. The company’s revenues topped the consensus mark in 22 out of the trailing 24 quarters.United Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Rentals, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Rentals, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Rentals, Inc. QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share (EPS) has increased to $9.23 from $9.20 over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates 17.4% growth from the year-ago EPS of $7.86. The consensus mark for revenues is $3.43 billion, suggesting a 23.9% year-over-year improvement.Factors to NoteUnited Rentals’ second-quarter performance is expected to have reflected sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business. Higher pricing and improved activity level, backed by stronger demand in each of the end markets served in North America (industrial and other non-construction and commercial construction), are expected to have aided United Rentals’ second-quarter results.Notably, federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power activities are expected to have benefited the company’s quarterly results. The company’s quarterly results are likely to have benefited from solid mega-project activity. URI’s solid exposure to blue-chip engineering &amp; construction accounts and industry-leading market share is expected to have reflected in its quarterly performance. Furthermore, acquisitions are expected to have helped United Rentals to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported.The company’s investment in the General Rental segment (wherein the primary growth drivers are non-residential construction and plant maintenance) also bodes well. Overall, industrial markets are expected to have aided the company’s performance.Equipment Rentals revenues (which accounted for 86.9% of its total revenues in 2022) are expected to have registered growth in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect Equipment Rentals revenues to increase 19% to $2,928.8 million in the second quarter from a year ago.Our model predicts, Rental Equipment sales to grow 86.6% to $306.1 million from the year-ago reported figure.New Equipment sales suggest an increase of 10.4% year over year. The contractor supplies sales indicate 9.2% growth from the prior year. Service and other revenues suggest 10% growth on a year-over-year basis.Overall, the company’s General Rentals revenues are expected to grow 23.7% to $2,508.3 million in the quarter from the year-ago period. On the other hand, the Specialty segment is expected to have registered 19.1% growth to $886 million in the second quarter from a year ago.From the margin perspective, supply-chain disruptions and higher inflation might be causes of concern. The consolidated operating margin is expected to decline to 24.4% in the quarter from 25.8% a year ago.We expected adjusted EBITDA for the quarter to grow 21.4% year over year to $1.59 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin, however, is expected to decline 40 basis points to 46.9%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for United Rentals for the quarter to be reported.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in United Rentals (URI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to URI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?United Rentals' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at United Rentals' main business drivers.Headquartered in Stamford, CT, United Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,525 rental locations in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Moreover, it operates in 49 U.S. states and every Canadian province. The company offers 4,700 classes of equipment for rent at a total original equipment cost (“OEC”) of $20 billion (as of Mar 31, 2023).The company’s customer base includes construction and industrial companies, utilities, municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors and homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations. The company’s principal products and services are equipment rental, sale of rental equipment, new equipment, contractor supplies, services and other.United Rentals serves customers as a single-source solution, provided through two business segments: General Rentals and Specialty or Trench, Power and Fluid Solutions.General Rentals (accounted for 73.7% of total revenues in 2022) includes the rental of construction, aerial and industrial equipment, general tools and light equipment, along with related services and activities. The segment includes the rental of the following: i) general construction and industrial equipment ii) aerial work platforms and iii) general tools and light equipment. The general rentals segment is comprised of four geographic divisions - Central, Northeast, Southeast and West - and operates throughout the United States and Canada.Story continuesSpecialty (26.3%) includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services like trench safety equipment, power and HVAC equipment, and fluid solutions equipment.On Jan 25, 2023, the company unveiled a dividend program wherein the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For United Rentals, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $7,953.91, or a gain of 695.39%, as of July 24, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 168.09% and the price of gold increased 42.91% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for URI too.Shares of United Rentals outperformed its industry in the past year. The company is benefitting from persistent share growth opportunities for certain non-residential verticals, including datacenters, distribution centers and renewables as well as the automotive and ship plants. Also, the company is expanding geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures. The company enjoys strong brand recognition, which enables it to draw customers and build customer loyalty. In 2023 the company expects to deliver another profitable year, strong cash flow, and attractive returns for shareholders backed by substantial opportunities across various federally funded projects. However, volatile oil &amp; natural gas prices and intense industry competition impact growth. Earnings estimates for 2023 decreased in the past 60 days.The stock is up 11.39% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2023.

Last Friday was the tenth straight session that the Dow finished in the green, a trend it has not achieved in more than six years.Better-than-expected earnings numbers reported through the week kept investor mood upbeat. However, a resilient labor market made market participants nervous because it would not deter the Federal Reserve from its path of further monetary policy tightening. This expectation of continued interest rate hikes, coupled with data from various sectors showing a gradual slowdown, added to recession fears.Investors’ eyes would keenly be on the July FOMC meeting slated for this week.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out the 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.In the first half of 2023, global economic growth picked up pace, reaching 2.8%. Up to this point, the impact of monetary tightening was balanced by the diminishing supply shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, since 2022, the surge in global policy rates by approximately 400 basis points (bps) has begun to affect interest-sensitive spending and impede factory output. Despite the current momentum, the fading resiliency of the global economy suggests that growth moderation is likely unavoidable. Speaking of the United States specifically, J.P. Morgan Research expects the country to undergo a mild recession towards the end of 2023. This prediction comes from the Federal Reserve's adoption of a restrictive policy stance, which is expected to lead to tighter credit conditions, consequently dragging down the economy.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan., stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to economists at Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25% from their previous projection of 35%, which was made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Research projects a robust annual average growth of 1.8% for this year, surpassing the consensus among private-sector economists and the projections made by the Federal Reserve.Story continuesIn the realm of investing, volatility holds significant importance. It becomes evident to investors during market downturns when certain individual stocks, characterized by higher volatility, undergo substantial price fluctuations. Additionally, it serves as a proxy for risk; higher volatility often implies a riskier portfolio. As an example, certain sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are known for being less volatile than others, making them potentially safer investment options during times of recession. Business Insider's report indicated that the consumer staples industry had outperformed the overall market by an impressive 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015, with much of this outperformance observed during recessionary periods. Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average experienced only a marginal decline of 1.4% in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 faced a substantial 19.4% decrease during the same period.See also: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowAs the first half of this year came to a close, the market received a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report. This has led some to question the need for acquiring the safer holdings as the overall market sentiment remains strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors. Although investors may be inclined to favor riskier securities with higher potential returns in such a market environment, it is important to realize that the market can shift and turn at any moment. In that regard, low volatility stocks serve as safe harbors for investors who are averse to turbulent market swings. Their comparatively steady performance not only aids in minimizing losses during downturns but also prevents hasty panic selling that could jeopardize one's retirement savings. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some low volatility stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), among others listed below.12 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected the following low risk stocks suitable based on optimistic analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The betas for these firms were below 1.0 as of July 19, which means these stocks are less risky as compared to the broader market. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.12. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Beta Value: 0.62Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a prominent American corporation renowned as one of the largest producers and marketers of tobacco, cigarettes, and related products worldwide. Its global operations are based in Henrico County, Virginia. With an impressive 54-year streak of dividend increases, few companies are as experienced as Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) in effectively navigating market downturns.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were long Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) at the end of the first quarter of 2023, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Natixis Global Asset Management's Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 6.33 million shares worth $282.77 million.Much like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a smart low volatility stock that investors should take note of.11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Beta Value: 0.35Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), commonly known as Verizon, is an American multinational telecommunication conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the first quarter of 2023, the telecommunications firm reported an increase of 633,000 subscribers.On June 1, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 1, to shareholders of record on July 10.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Billionaire Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $188.5 million.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Beta Value: 0.54Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a major American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. The company is a global leader in the beverage industry, and is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $77 to $74 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Although the analyst perceives KO as a stronger defensive stock during inflationary periods compared to its historical performance, he expresses near-term apprehension concerning the ongoing tax litigation.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”9. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.64McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 46 years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.52 per share and its dividend yield on July 19 stood at 2.07%.On April 25, the company released its most recent fiscal quarter results, surpassing the consensus earnings forecast. The revenue exhibited a notable 4% year-over-year growth, exceeding the consensus revenue forecast by over $300 million, while the adjusted EPS expanded from $2.28 to $2.63.At the end of Q1 2023, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), up from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $4 billion. With over 1.64 million shares, Paul Marshall And Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was the company’s leading stakeholder.8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Beta Value: 0.35Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, the company is renowned developing and manufacturing medicines and vaccines spanning various fields, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. Notably, in 2022, Pfizer's top-performing product was the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, which generated an impressive $37.8 billion in alliance revenues and direct sales.The biotech company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 13 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.50%, as of July 19.At the end of March 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), worth collectively roughly $2.2 billion. Of these, Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest shareholder, with total stakes worth approximately $380.28 million.7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.54AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) operates as a specialized biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of drugs designed to address chronic and complex diseases. The company is best known for manufacturing its blockbuster drug Humira — a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.With a record of 50 years of continuous dividend growth, the American pharmaceutical company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with yield of 4.30% as of July 19.As of the close of Q1 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q1.Harding Loevner mentioned AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.41The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On June 11, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend.

The company's operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on the Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is a low volatility stock that hedge funds are piling into.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.Suggested articles:12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $2510 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $1010 Best One Dollar Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

346,6331156f-f6d0-361e-b691-ddabbf9c77d2,MCD,2023-07-25,Yum China Holdings (YUMC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-china-holdings-yumc-earnings-140031961.html,1690207231,STORY,"['YUMC', 'MCD']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Yum China Holdings (YUMC) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis restaurant operator in China is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +95%.Revenues are expected to be $2.64 billion, up 24.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.67% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum China?For Yum China, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.69%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Yum China will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yum China would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of +60.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Yum China appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, McDonald's (MCD) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.77 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.22 billion, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for McDonald's has been revised 0.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.05%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald's will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about McDonald's (MCD).McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying McDonald's, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MCD?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $11.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

349,04bea2f0-3459-3ba8-94e8-779d249671c9,MCD,2023-07-25,"McDonald's Corporation (MCD) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-corporation-mcd-hit-52-131508645.html,1690204508,STORY,['MCD'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of McDonald's (MCD)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $299.35 in the previous session. McDonald's has gained 12.2% since the start of the year compared to the 17% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 12.9% return for the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2023, McDonald's reported EPS of $2.63 versus consensus estimate of $2.31.For the current fiscal year, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $11.11 per share on $25.05 billion in revenues. This represents a 10% change in EPS on an 8.05% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $12.18 per share on $26.82 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 9.62% and 7.06%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMcDonald's may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.McDonald's has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 26.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 24.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.1X versus its peer group's average of 14.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.1. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, McDonald's currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if McDonald's fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though McDonald's shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does MCD Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MCD have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY). PLAY has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 23.93%, and for the current fiscal year, PLAY is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share on revenue of $2.3 billion.Shares of Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment, Inc. have gained 8.5% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 12.88X and a P/CF of 7.3X.The Retail - Restaurants industry is in the top 17% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MCD and PLAY, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 13.9%.How are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.77 per share, indicating growth of 8.7% from $2.55 reported in the year-ago quarter. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $6.22 billion. The metric suggests an improvement of 8.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Let's delve deeper.Factors at PlayMcDonald's second-quarter results are likely to gain from strong comps growth, menu innovation, expansion efforts, increase in average check growth and menu price. Robust digitalization is an added positive. Our model predicts the company’s U.S and international comps to increase 7% and 7.8% year over year, respectively.McDonald’s is consistently trying to improve its performance in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. MCD intends to drive comps growth in these markets by introducing value meals, customizing menu to local tastes, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery and digitalized presence.We expect the U.S. segment’s total revenues in second-quarter 2023 to be up nearly 8.8% year over year to $2,575.6 million. Our model estimates total international operated markets revenues to decline 2.8% year over year to $2,643.9 million.However, margins in second-quarter might have suffered due to continued pressure from elevated costs for commodities and wages. Management expects to witness food and paper inflation in 2023 in the mid-to-high single digits.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMcDonald's Corporation price-eps-surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for McDonald's this time around.

Particularly, with the growth of the digital economy, commercial real estate like industrial and data centers, which support the industry, are likely to continue prospering in the foreseeable future.Also, the fundamentals of healthcare real estate remain resilient, while the resumption of travel is encouraging for Hotel REITs. Against this backdrop, Prologis, EastGroup Properties and Ryman Hospitality Properties are likely to prosper.Despite an improvement in the fundamentals of the real estate market from the onset of the pandemic, there are concerns stemming from high interest rates and any economic slowdown. These are affecting the leasing activity of several asset categories and hurting the industry’s overall prospects.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is a diversified group that covers REIT stocks from different asset categories like industrial, office, lodging, healthcare, self-storage, data centers, infrastructures and others. Equity REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental incomes. Economic growth plays a pivotal role in the real estate sector as economic expansion translates into greater demand for real estate, higher occupancy levels and landlords’ increased power to ask for higher rents.Also, the performance of Equity REITs depends on the underlying asset dynamics and the location of properties. Hence, delving into the fundamentals of these asset categories is essential before making any investment decision. It is important to figure out whether pandemic-induced behaviors result in only a short-term impact or long-term structural changes.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Other Industry?Demand for Asset Categories Linked to Digital Economy to Remain Resilient: Industries such as industrial, infrastructure and data centers, which are crucial to the development of the digital economy, are expected to thrive in the foreseeable future. The demand for industrial real estate space will continue to be fueled by the expansion of e-commerce and advancements in supply-chain systems. Additionally, the strategic location of properties will be a key factor driving this demand.Enterprises' increasing reliance on technology and their swift adoption of digital transformation strategies are creating significant opportunities for data centers and infrastructure REITs. Especially during uncertain periods, data centers are likely to become more appealing to investors due to their resilient and predictable stream of earnings compared to other asset categories.Certain Asset Categories to Remain Resilient, While Some Rebound: Healthcare REITs, which are poised to benefit from strong demographic demands amid the aging of the baby boomer generation, are experiencing an improvement in occupancy in senior housing assets. Moreover, the healthcare sector is expected to remain resilient, particularly during anticipated recessions. This is because these property types are characterized by non-cyclical demand. Moreover, the lodging and resort sector, which was hard-hit by the pandemic, is expected to continue rebounding with the waning of pandemic concerns and the easing of travel restrictions.Economic Concerns and Office Sector Uncertainties: Rising debt costs, as well as high construction and operating expenses, are likely to lead to financial stress for REITs. Apart from high interest rates and constrained debt markets, softness in the job market, especially in a recessionary environment, could further strain the sector. Particularly, the office real estate market is facing significant challenges due to the rise of remote and flexible work arrangements. Many companies are re-evaluating their need for physical office space, leading to decreased demand and increased vacancy rates. Unless the economic outlook is clearer and more positive, any significant turnaround is likely to remain elusive.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #121, which places it in the top 48% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT and Equity Trust - Other Industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Zacks Finance sector in a year.The industry has declined 12.6% during this period against the S&amp;P 500’s increase of 14.4%. Meanwhile, the broader Finance sector has risen 8.5%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing REIT - Others, we see that the industry is currently trading at 14.79X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 20.00X. However, the industry is trading above the Finance sector’s forward 12-month P/E of 14.23X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.14X and as low as 14.18X, with a median of 17.79X.3 Equity REIT - Other Stocks Worth Betting OnRyman Hospitality Properties: Ryman Hospitality is a prominent REIT in the lodging and hospitality sector, with a primary focus on upscale convention center resorts and entertainment experiences.The company is poised to benefit from the continuation of travel of its core group customers at more typical pre-pandemic levels. Also, its resorts remain popular leisure destinations. Moreover, during the quarter, it closed the acquisition of the JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort &amp; Spa in San Antonio, TX, from Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust for $800 million.RHP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ryman Hospitality Properties’ 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved 2.2% north over the past week to $7.47. It calls for a 14.6% increase year over year. The stock has increased 3.7% over the past month. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Prologis: This is a leading industrial REIT that acquires, develops, operates and manages industrial properties in the United States and worldwide. The company continues to benefit from the scale of its platform.The second-quarter 2023 results of this industrial REIT, which announced the acquisition of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone worth $3.1 billion in June, reflect healthy leasing activity and solid rent growth.This industrial REIT behemoth’s performance in recent quarters reflects robust demand for its properties, an increase in rents and low vacancies. Along with the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is anticipated to gain from a rise in inventory levels. Given Prologis’ capacity to offer high-quality facilities in key markets and robust balance-sheet strength, it is well-poised to bank on these trends.Currently, PLD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has witnessed a marginal upward revision to $5.52, reflecting analysts’ bullish outlook. Prologis’ long-term growth rate is projected at 7.8%, ahead of the industry average of 6.6%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EGP’s 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally north over the past month to $7.56, calling for an 8% increase year over year. The stock has also rallied 9.3% in the past month.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Prologis in FocusBased in San Francisco, Prologis (PLD) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 11.27%. The industrial real estate developer is paying out a dividend of $0.87 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.77% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.5% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.59%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.48 is up 10.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Prologis has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.43%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Prologis's current payout ratio is 58%, meaning it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PLD expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.52 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.98%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that PLD is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, the lodging and resort sector, which was hard-hit by the pandemic, is expected to continue rebounding with the waning of pandemic concerns and the easing of travel restrictions.Economic Concerns and Office Sector Uncertainties: Rising debt costs, as well as high construction and operating expenses, are likely to lead to financial stress for REITs. Apart from high interest rates and constrained debt markets, softness in the job market, especially in a recessionary environment, could further strain the sector. Particularly, the office real estate market is facing significant challenges due to the rise of remote and flexible work arrangements. Many companies are re-evaluating their need for physical office space, leading to decreased demand and increased vacancy rates. Unless the economic outlook is clearer and more positive, any significant turnaround is likely to remain elusive.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is housed within the broader Finance sector.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PACCAR is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PCAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.13 per share for PCAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.12 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PCAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.27% heading into earnings season.PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. price-eps-surprise | PACCAR Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

361,202fe43f-0cdb-35c9-ac1a-8f03a7cb42af,UPS,2023-07-25,Shipper sentiment is slipping. Is the freight market turning?,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shipper-sentiment-slipping-freight-market-120100740.html,1690286460,STORY,['UPS'],"[For the first time since index inception in Q4 2022, shippers are the least positive group. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Note: This article about the freight sentiment indexes was published before UPS and the Teamsters announced they had reached a tentative agreement.Entering the third quarter of 2023, the freight market is at a crossroads, teetering between tumult and a potential step toward balance. The first half of the year, best characterized by a capacity glut that pushed truckload spot rates underwater, has shown signs of bottoming. Now, the turmoil at major carriers is beginning to make its mark, and freight sentiment is changing.Yellow (NASDAQ: YELL), the troubled Kansas-based less-than-truckload carrier, is struggling to stay afloat, pressured by a Teamsters union that may be prepared to strike if the company is unable to pay the $50 million owed to its pension fund in the next 30 days. In another show of force, the union is currently negotiating with UPS (NYSE: UPS) and could strike come August if the parties don’t reach an agreement. Elsewhere, FedEx pilots surprisingly rejected a contract amendment, and last month West Coast ports narrowly averted a peak season shutdown.There’s no debating it: North American supply chains are flirting with major, multimodal restructuring.RELATED: LTL industry likely altered regardless of Yellow’s fateThe Q3 2023 Freight Sentiment Indexes show the freight market in this flux. For the first time since we began tracking in Q4 2022, shippers are the least positive group (though their overall score is still above 0), and this shift in sentiment could be a first indication of a market change.Shippers have enjoyed pricing power this year due to excess capacity, but their sentiment this quarter now dips to 8.32 from 10.56. (See also: FreightWaves’ Pricing Power Index has moved slightly in carriers’ favor.)Carriers and brokers are showing increased positivity in Q3 2023. This could be a response to the potential for last-minute freight movements and the ability to renegotiate higher rates as shippers look for alternatives amid the industry disruptions.Story continuesBrokers/3PLs have seen their sentiment rise to 12.55 from 9.39 in Q2. Carriers, who had been grappling with negative overall sentiment in Q2, have rebounded to a positive sentiment of 9.17 in Q3. This has to do in large part with their growing confidence that they’ll be more profitable in 12 months.When taken together, the Q3 2023 Freight Sentiment Indexes suggest a change is underway.Note: Survey data was fielded in the first two weeks of July.FreightWaves SONAR: LTL contract initial (LCWT1.USA) and final (LCWTF.USA) reporting rates over the previous five years. In 2023, LTL rates have held strong, leading to the possibility of capacity spilling over into the truckload market if Yellow declares bankruptcy and LTL rates climb.Carrier sentiment: Climbing amid industry upheavalCarriers are showing renewed optimism in Q3 2023. Their overall sentiment has rebounded from a minus 0.52 in Q2 to a positive 9.17 in Q3. This shift reflects a belief that’s been gaining some traction recently: that we’ve already hit rock bottom and will experience a rebound over the next 12 months.One of the key drivers of this positive sentiment is the significant increase in carriers’ longer-term profitability sentiment. This metric has risen from 6.28 in Q2 to a robust 25.68 in Q3, suggesting that carriers are optimistic about their future earnings. This optimism may be fueled by the potential for increased pricing power as supply-and-demand dynamics begin to shift in their favor.Yellow was able to temporarily avoid a strike, but the company is far from in the clear. A UPS strike would likely have even wider implications.The exit of a major player like Yellow from the market could help balance the current excess capacity in the transportation market, giving remaining carriers more leverage to negotiate rates. It could also provide opportunities in the equipment and labor markets. Carriers with strong balance sheets might have a chance to expand their fleets and workforces at a lower cost.RELATED: 5 things to know with the UPS-Teamsters clock tickingSimilarly, a strike at UPS could lead to a surge in last-minute freight movements, providing carriers with additional opportunities to secure higher rates. These developments, while disruptive, could ultimately strengthen carriers’ position in the market and contribute to their positive sentiment.It’s important to note that while the sentiment is positive, it’s not uniformly so across all carriers. Many are still facing monumental challenges, and the overall positive sentiment should not overshadow the need for continued resilience and adaptability in the face of a dynamic and often unpredictable market. Additionally, near-term sentiment is still below 0 (minus 1.44).FreightWaves SONAR: Outbound tender rejections (OTRI.USA) with outbound tender volume (OTVI.USA) over the previous five years. Because neither volume nor rejections have really started to pick up yet, we can infer that broker and carrier positivity is more focused on the long term (i.e., 12 months out) than near.Broker sentiment: Disruptions could mean opportunitiesBrokers and 3PLs are also demonstrating a positive outlook in Q3 2023. Their overall sentiment has risen from 9.39 in Q2 to 12.55 in Q3, reflecting a growing confidence in the market. This increase suggests that brokers and 3PLs are anticipating favorable conditions in the future, with the exception of workforce, which ticked down on both a near-term and long-term basis.Like carriers, the significant factor contributing to this positive sentiment is the substantial increase in longer-term profitability sentiment. This metric has risen from 16.88 in Q2 to a remarkable 27.47 in Q3, indicating that brokers and 3PLs are optimistic about their future earnings. This optimism may be driven by the potential for increased business as shippers look for alternatives amid industry disruptions.The potential bankruptcy of Yellow and the possible strike at UPS could have a significant impact on brokers and 3PLs. These events could lead to a surge in last-minute freight movements as shippers scramble to find alternatives, providing brokers and 3PLs with additional business opportunities. Typically, brokers thrive in volatile markets, and these disruptions could give them more leverage to negotiate higher rates, further boosting their profitability.FreightWaves SONAR: Container Atlas Ocean TEU Volume Index. Ocean imports are a long way off from pandemic-era highs, but they’ve held strong this year, keeping domestic freight volumes afloat.Shipper sentiment: Dipping as market shiftsShippers are showing a decrease in overall positivity in Q3 2023. Their top-line index has dipped to 8.32 from 10.56 in Q2, marking the first time shippers are the least positive group since the inception of the index in Q4 2022. This change could be an early indication of a market shift, with shippers potentially losing some of the pricing power they have enjoyed over the past year due to excess capacity.A key factor contributing to this decrease in sentiment is the drop in near-term profitability sentiment. Shippers’ near-term profitability sentiment has decreased to 5.48 in Q3 from 11.26 in Q2. While this figure is still notably above 0, the trend is suggesting concerns about immediate earnings. This could be a reflection of the potential challenges shippers face due to industry disruptions.Shippers will be the real losers if Yellow files for bankruptcy or UPS strikes. They’ll need to find alternative freight services on short notice, potentially at higher rates. This could further impact near-term profitability.They’re also grappling with macroeconomic factors. Economic data paint a picture of fairly resilient consumer spending and a robust (but slowing) job market. Still, shippers haven’t fully enjoyed the easy freight environment because of higher-than-target inventory levels and fears about future demand.And it might be passing them by.Related articlesSo this is what the bottom of the freight market feels like?Are FreightTech companies in trouble in 2023?When will the spot market bottom out?

362,c370116d-00e3-3779-93a3-8b9204d18648,UPS,2023-07-25,Here's Why United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-united-parcel-nyse-110116429.html,1690282876,STORY,['UPS'],"[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What Is United Parcel Service's Debt?As you can see below, United Parcel Service had US$21.8b of debt, at March 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$9.40b, its net debt is less, at about US$12.4b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At United Parcel Service's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that United Parcel Service had liabilities of US$16.3b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$35.9b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$9.40b and US$10.6b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$32.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Since publicly traded United Parcel Service shares are worth a very impressive total of US$161.8b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.United Parcel Service has a low debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.77. But the really cool thing is that it actually managed to receive more interest than it paid, over the last year. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. On the other hand, United Parcel Service saw its EBIT drop by 4.4% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine United Parcel Service's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, United Parcel Service produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 69% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, United Parcel Service's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like United Parcel Service is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - United Parcel Service has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

Teamsters-represented workers have vowed to strike if they do not have a deal when the current contract expires at midnight on July 31.Investors have joined UPS customers in urging the two sides to avoid a work stoppage that would disrupt shipments across the country and create supply-chain backups that stoke inflation.One estimate put the potential economic impact of a 10-day UPS strike at more than $7 billion, the costliest in modern times. That estimate from Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group includes UPS customer losses of $4.6 billion, lost wages of $1.1 billion and company losses of $816 million.""The vast, vast, vast majority of shareholders are eager to see a strike averted,"" New York City Comptroller Brad Lander told Reuters.Lander serves as investment advisor for the New York Retirement Systems, which held UPS shares valued at $191.1 million as of June 30.He said the better option is for the company to put ""a good deal on the table addressing the issue that the Teamsters have made quite clear is the remaining sticking point.""(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

They already get the benefits that full time employees get. So that may not be as much of an issue, though. We don't really know. Also what we don't know are the issues for the full time workers. These are the regular old UPS full time workers that deliver the packages to your front door and to the doors of many businesses around the country.They make an average of $42 an hour. We don't know what their demands are at this point. As for those part time workers, they currently make about average of $20 an hour, plus benefits. All of these employees getting the same benefits and pensions regardless of where they stand in that hierarchy.Already agreed to, though, UPS tells Yahoo Finance that they are converting a hybrid group of workers. These are full time workers that work Tuesday through Saturday to full time worker status. They currently make about 36, precisely $36.54 an hour.These are kind of hybrid workers who work both in the warehouse, as well as deliver packages. But we do have some estimates now coming from the Anderson Economic Group. And what they say is that a 10-day strike could cost the US economy, approximately $7 billion they talk about lost wages for those 340,000 workers who would be furloughed.Story continuesAlso lost to customers. They estimate that to be about $4 billion. And then lost revenue for UPS as well. So a lot still to be settled here. The parties, though, getting back to negotiations, hopefully first thing tomorrow.- Hopefully. And it's important to point out that we haven't had a situation like this since 1997.ALEXIS KEENAN: Yes.- So a lot of new stuff to potentially deal with. When it comes to the United States Postal Service, what are they saying about their ability to pick up packages, do their job if there is, in fact, a strike?ALEXIS KEENAN: So.- Yes.ALEXIS KEENAN: The Postal Service, they say they do have the capacity to fill any stoppages that would be happening at UPS, though, there are other experts who say that no, there would be some holes in the system. And after about a couple of weeks, there'd really be some stress.You have to look at inflationary pressures too. Because if UPS is not in the mix, you now have FedEx, you have Amazon, you have others picking up the slack, USPS included. And they could take advantage of this situation and raise prices for both regular consumers like you and me, as well as businesses.But just quickly, take a look at the extent to which the US economy is reliant on UPS. In 2022 of 21.2 billion domestic packages delivered, according to Pitney Bowes, you had UPS accounting for 5.2 billion of those packages. That's a roughly 24%. Just behind USPS, who says they have the capacity, they were delivering 6.7 billion. FedEx at 4.1, and Amazon at 4.8 billion. So big numbers there. And whether or not these other players could pick up the slack, we hope we don't see.- Yeah. So I forget how big Amazon logistics has come has become over the last few years. Thank you for that, Alexis Keenan.]"

371,311012b4-9099-3b1f-bc35-505940bb1e9c,AXP,2023-07-25,Debit Cards vs Charge Cards,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clone-debit-cards-vs-charge-175411926.html,1690221251,STORY,['AXP'],"[Whether sticking to a budget or reaping big rewards, understand whether debit cards vs charge cards are right for you.The decision to use debit cards vs charge cards is a whole lot easier these days; most charge cards have been phased out in favor of credit cards. Still, there are a few compelling charge card choices available, and it’s helpful to understand how they differ from your bank debit card.Debit cards vs charge cardsIn a nutshell, debit cards immediately draw money from your bank account to cover a purchase, while charge cards require you to pay your bill in full each month.Debit cards act like digital checks; they pull money directly from your checking or savings account to cover purchases. You can’t spend more money than you have in your account unless you have overdraft protection.Charge cards have no revolving line of credit, so if you don’t pay your bill when it’s due, you can’t carry a balance forward as you can with a credit card. And if you don't pay your bills on time, the issuer will likely close your charge card account and penalize you with a fee.When to use a debit cardIf you like the convenience of paying with plastic but prefer to spend within the limits of your bank balance, you probably tend to reach for your debit card when you’re at the register. And when you pay with a debit card (as with a credit card), you can track your spending by eyeballing your monthly statement.Some checking accounts pay an enticing interest rate on the balance, as well as refund out-of-network ATM surcharges if you use your debit card several times a month and meet other requirements.Many institutions halted their debit rewards programs years ago, and the programs that remain aren’t typically as lucrative as those offered by the best credit cards. But it’s worth checking whether your bank offers discounts at certain merchants or points for the money you spend using your debit card.For consumers concerned about the environment, there are green debit cards that pay between 1% and 6% cash back for sustainable purchases or services. For example, you can get cash back for taking public transit, charging an electric car, or shopping at online secondhand stores like Threadup.Story continuesBest Rewards Credit CardsThere are some downsides to debit cards. Legally, debit cards have weaker fraud protections than charge cards. Your liability is capped at $50 in unauthorized charges if you notify your bank within two business days of learning that your debit card has been lost or stolen, but you could be on the hook for up to $500 if you report a missing card after those two days have passed. And if you wait more than 60 calendar days after your statement is sent, you could possibly be responsible for all the money stolen from your account.If you report a missing debit card before any suspicious charges appear, you’ll have no liability. And if your card number, but not the card itself, is used fraudulently, you won’t be responsible for unauthorized charges if you contest them within 60 days of the statement containing them having been mailed to you.In practice, your bank will likely refund any unauthorized charges as long as you notify it promptly of a lost or stolen debit card. But you may have to wait several days to get the money back in your account.It’s tempting to spend more than you have in your checking account if you enroll in overdraft protection, and the fees can be ugly, up to $35 a pop if the bank covers the overdraft for you. Arranging an automatic transfer of money from savings to checking in case of an overdraft can also incur charges of as much as $12 per transfer. (If you have no overdraft protection, merchants will decline your debit card.)When to use a charge cardCharge cards have mostly been replaced by credit cards, but those that are still around are very popular. The American Express Green, Gold and Platinum cards are all charge cards, although they are often called credit cards. Unlike credit or debit cards, charge cards have no pre-set spending limit (NPSL). This means the card issuer approves your purchases as you spend. For this reason, charge cards are best for people who have excellent cash flow and are diligent about paying bills on time.American Express Charge Cards: The Best Pick for You?One of the greatest benefits of a charge card is the ability to make a large purchase without it affecting your credit score. That’s because charge cards may report your purchase history, but not your credit utilization ratio to credit bureaus. (It's best to use only about 30% of all of your available credit in a given month to keep a good credit score.) Since a charge card has no line of credit, it’s impossible to establish such a ratio. So if you have an expensive emergency while on travel, for example, your charge card will most likely cover it, and your credit ratio will be unaffected as long as you pay your bill in full and on time.American Express charge cards provide impressive rewards, from travel insurance to sign-on bonuses (just remember that they also have hefty annual fees.) Few debit cards will provide meaningful cash back or travel rewards.Since you don’t roll over your balance from month to month, charge cards don’t provide 0% APR offers or balance transfers. Charge cards may help prevent overspending as cardholders know they’ll have to find the full amount each month, rather than just the minimum payment.]"

Quote The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $1.82 billion, indicating a 19.7% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of $1.52 billion.Factors to NoteMartin Marietta’s second-quarter revenues are expected to have improved on the back of strong pricing gains in aggregates, strength in public construction and accretive acquisitions. The company expects solid near-term product demand reinforced by healthy customer backlogs across its coast-to-coast footprint, led by infrastructure and heavy non-residential projects of scale.MLM’s business has been sensitive to changes in construction spending, particularly housing and public construction in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, as well as Iowa. Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways, roads and streets, might have also contributed to its performance in the quarter, as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded.Our model suggests Aggregates pricing to increase to $18.54 per ton, marking 13.4% year-over-year growth. We expect Aggregates revenues to increase 12.7% year over year to $1,076.6 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Aggregates volume is pegged at 58.951 million tons versus 57.8 million reported a year ago.We expect cement revenues to increase 38.7% year over year to $219 million.

Also, inflation, higher liquid asphalt and diesel fuel costs, a rise in transportation and insurance costs, as well as labor costs, may have impacted the bottom line in the second quarter. Also, costs related to higher repair and maintenance, supply and contract as well as supply-chain bottlenecks are added concerns.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this time around.

376,6f4e9e6e-6445-3031-a063-8edb6eb689d4,ZBH,2023-07-25,Will Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) Beat Estimates This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zimmer-biomet-zbh-beat-estimates-142200669.html,1690208520,STORY,['ZBH'],"[Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. ZBH is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.89 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.86%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the consensus estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 7.38%. Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the last reported first quarter, Zimmer Biomet talked about three major headwinds leading to revenue disruption. These were high level of supply pressure, staffing issues and COVID-related challenges. However, the company also assumed these headwinds to ease out as the year progressed, leading to better recovery in terms of elective procedures. This is likely to be reflected in the second-quarter results of the company.However, the company might have still faced upheaval in overall business, thanks to the global inflationary situation. Rising labor and raw material costs and FX headwinds might have impacted ZBH’s bottom line in the second quarter.Further, the implementation of the volume-based procurement program brought down China’s orthopedic device prices, which might have otherwise impacted ZBH’s business in this region in the to-be-reported quarter.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteOverall, Zimmer Biomet is expected to have particularly witnessed procedure recovery in its legacy business in the second quarter. Strong strategic execution and a solid momentum with innovations are expected to have driven second-quarter revenues within the Knee and Hip businesses.We expect the company to have witnessed strength in its performances within its Hips and Knees product portfolio in the United States.The company is expected to have witnessed strong performance across G7 Revision System and Avenir Complete primary hip, which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach. These along with the continued solid Rosa pull-through in the hip category, especially in the United States, too should significantly contribute to the top line within the Hip category.Story continuesGoing by our model, the Hip business of Zimmer Biomet is projected to grow 6.6% in Q2 on a year-over-year basis.Within Knees, apart from a strong recovery in elective procedures, easy comparisons outside the United States, strong knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction in the Persona knee system and continued increase in Rosa procedure penetration and pull-through are expected to have contributed to the company’s Knees business. The company is expected to have also gained from the recent launch of the Persona OsseoTi Keel Tibia for Cementless Knee Replacement.Per our model estimates, the Knee business is expected to grow 1% in Q2 on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, in the first quarter, priority areas like the S.E.T. business (comprising Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) reported strong performance across key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine, and upper extremities. This might have been once again repeated in the second quarter. Zimmer Biomet is also likely to have gained from the launch of the Identity shoulder system in the United States.S.E.T. might have been impacted by a comp tailwind from China VBP that was partially offset by reimbursement changes in restorative therapies.For this business, our model shows a year-over-year expected revenue decline of 3.6% for Q2.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.83 billion, suggesting a 2.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $1.82 indicates no change from the year-ago adjusted earnings.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a higher chance of beating estimates. This is exactly the case, as you can see below.Earnings ESP: Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of +2.34%.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.86 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on August 1, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.86 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.82 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of 2.34%.ZBH is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Boston Scientific (BSX) as well.Boston Scientific, which is readying to report earnings on July 27, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.49 a share, and BSX is three days out from its next earnings report.For Boston Scientific, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.49 is 0.47%.Story continuesZBH and BSX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

378,6447799e-0a16-3509-84eb-a77e976a549d,ZBH,2023-07-25,STERIS (STE) Set to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steris-ste-set-post-q1-114300872.html,1690198980,STORY,"['STE', 'ZBH']","[STERIS plc STE is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 2 before the opening bell.The company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.30 in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.98%. STERIS beat earnings estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, missed the same in two and was break-even in one, the average negative surprise being 0.63%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayHealthcareThe Healthcare arm of STERIS is likely to have generated strong organic revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, as witnessed during the previous quarter’s months. The performance is expected to have witnessed high-teens growth in capital equipment and an improvement in consumables and service revenues.With the easing of supply-chain issues, STE reported a sequential improvement, with an additional $50 million of capital equipment shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, despite growth, STERIS’ healthcare backlog stayed at nearly $500 million. Capital equipment orders for the quarter represented 50% of the large projects, which tend to have longer lead times. We expect STERIS to have a strong fiscal first quarter in terms of healthcare capital shipments.Our model projects the segment’s revenues for the fiscal first quarter to improve 5.8% year over year to $739.2 million.STERIS plc Price and EPS SurpriseSTERIS plc Price and EPS SurpriseSTERIS plc price-eps-surprise | STERIS plc QuoteApplied Sterilization Technologies (AST)Similar to the last reported quarter, the performance of this segment is likely to be driven by solid underlying demand from core medical device customers. Meanwhile, we expect the reduced demand for single-use bioprocessing disposables is likely to follow in the fiscal 2024 first quarter also.On the last earnings call, management noted that the sequential growth in demand is likely to return in the second half of fiscal 2024, while year-over-year growth is not anticipated until fiscal 2025. Per our model, the projected revenues of the AST segment for the fiscal first quarter stand at $224.4 million, an improvement of 1.6% year over year.Story continuesLife SciencesIn the fiscal first quarter of 2024, we expect the Life Science segment to have benefitted from an improvement in consumable revenues, capital equipment revenues and service revenues.  The company had a record quarter of capital shipments last time due to the execution of a delayed capital shipment of about $10 million.On the consumable side, STERIS had a strong finish in fiscal 2023, having worked through supply-chain challenges, including more normalized shipping to the Asia Pacific. Growth in service revenues for the year was backed by solid performance and equipment maintenance and the installation of new capital equipment. We believe the company is likely to have benefitted from all these trends in the fiscal first quarter. Our model projects the segment’s revenues for the fiscal first quarter to decline 2.8% year over year to $128.5 million.At the end of fiscal 2023, Life Science’s capital equipment backlog remained at just more than $100 million. While we expect the company to return to the normal cadence of shipments in the latter part of fiscal 2024, they may not have fully materialized in the fiscal first-quarter months.DentalWe expect the Dental business is likely to post lower or flat organic revenues in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 similar to the last reported one. On the quarter’s earnings call, management noted that procedure volumes remained at nearly 95% of pre-pandemic levels due to broader economic pressures impacting consumer spending.Per our model, the projected revenues of the Dental segment for the fiscal first quarter stand at $99.9 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.7%.Q1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for STERIS’ first quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.19 billion. This suggests an increase of 3.1% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its first-quarter fiscal 2024 EPS of $1.86 indicates a year-over-year decline of 2.1%What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates, which is not the case here.Earnings ESP: STERIS has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been unchanged over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur model predicts an earnings beat for Pentair this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Pentair has an Earnings ESP of +0.84%.  Zacks Rank: Pentair currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Key Factors to NotePNR has been clearing out its inventory. This ongoing optimization of inventory levels is expected to have impacted volumes in the second quarter. We, thus, expect volume to fall 10.2% year over year in the second quarter.Pentair has been witnessing a tight supply of raw materials, such as metals, resins and electronics, along with rising logistics costs. While it has been implementing pricing actions and focusing on productivity improvements that may have negated these headwinds, supply-chain pressures and inflationary costs are likely to have weighed on the quarter’s performance.PNR has also been focusing on productivity improvements, which is likely to have contributed to earnings in the quarter. We expect the price to rise 5.9% year over year in the quarter.Gains from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition and expected benefits from the Transformation program are expected to have helped offset the impacts of higher costs and low volumes in the second quarter.  Our model predicts acquisitions to have a positive impact of 5% on second-quarter revenues.The company has been witnessing weak demand in the pool business recently. Reflecting this, we expect the Pool segment’s sales to be $364 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 21.5%. The downside is driven by the ongoing inventory reduction. The segment’s operating income is expected to fall 9.1% year over year to $124.3 million.Our model predicts the Water Solutions segment’s net sales to increase 34.9% year over year to $299.7 million in the quarter. The operating income is expected to increase 35.3% to $44 million.We expect Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies’ revenues to be $390.1 million, indicating an improvement of 3.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for this segment’s operating profit is expected to be $66.8 million, suggesting growth of 13% from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of PNR have gained 41.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 7.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other Industrial Products stocks worth considering, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases.EnerSys ENS, set to release earnings on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +8.32% and sports a Zacks Rank of 1 at present.

While the S&amp;P 500 Energy Index is down nearly 10% this year, the broader benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is up 18%.The share prices of most oil companies are in the doldrums. This is especially true of the biggest oil companies — the so-called “Super Majors” — that enjoyed record profits throughout 2022 and returned much of the windfall to stockholders in the form of increased dividend payments and share repurchase programs.Now, many oil companies are cutting their quarterly dividends and revising their earnings forecasts as crude prices slump and their earnings return to more typical levels. And while the downturn might seem disheartening to investors, especially after such a big run, the reality is that the industry-wide decline has created a buying opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntrepid long-term investors can now buy the shares of leading oil companies on the cheap. Here are the three most undervalued oil stocks to buy now.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has reversed lower, erasing much of its gains from 2022. Today, OXY stock is trading down 3% on the year. Over the past 12 months, the share price has declined 1%. And through five years, Occidental Petroleum’s stock has deflated 28%.Yet, despite the disappointing share price performance, OXY stock remains a favorite security of famed investor Warren Buffett. Every time Occidental Petroleum’s share price falls below $60, Buffett buys more of the stock. He now owns 25% of the company.Buffett has continued buying the stock throughout this year as the share price has continued to decline. His current stake in the company, worth $13.46 billion, is significant as he only began acquiring shares in early 2022 before Russia invaded Ukraine and crude oil prices spiked.Story continuesDespite the pullback in oil prices and decline in OXY stock, Buffett is sticking with his investment and continues to build it, though he has said he doesn’t plan to take a controlling stake in the company. Buffett’s resolve can be viewed as a vote of confidence in OXY stock.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comU.S. oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has seen its stock hit hard this year, falling 13% since January. While the company is still clinging to a 10% gain over the last 12 months, that increase is evaporating as the share price trends lower.Trading nearly 20% below its 52-week high and at just eight times forward earnings estimates, CVX stock is looking undervalued at current levels. Chevron’s shares also offer an attractive quarterly dividend of $1.51 a share, a good yield of 3.92%.Chevron raised its dividend and announced a new $75 billion stock buyback program earlier this year as it reported strong profits. The company most recently reported that its net profit rose 5% to $6.57 billion or $3.46 per share in this year’s first quarter. That was better than Wall Street consensus estimates for a flat profit at $3.38 a share. The company attributed the rise in its Q1 profit to its oil refining business, where higher margins helped income grow five-fold to $1.8 billion. Chevron reports its Q2 earnings on July 28.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comEuropean oil major Shell (NYSE:SHEL) is doing everything to keep shareholders from hitting the sell button. In mid-June of this year, the company announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend by 15% to 54 cents a share, giving it a hefty yield of 3.53%.  The company also announced plans to increase its share repurchase program for the just completed second quarter to $5 billion from $4 billion in previous quarters. And, Shell announced that it no longer plans to cut its oil production 20% by 2030.The positive news has helped SHEL stock to outperform its peers. Year-to-date, Shell’s share price is up 9%. However, the current year’s performance can’t mask the poor long-term results. Over the past five years, Shell stock has declined 12%. While the company reported a record $40 billion profit in 2022, that success is softening with crude oil prices trading below $75 per barrel. The company’s most recent results were boosted largely by fuel trading.SHEL stock is currently trading at five times forward earnings, suggesting it’s undervalued.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue reliably in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products in electrophysiology and structural heart. Coupled with cost discipline and over 50 basis points of annual operating margin expansion, we believe the company’s double-digit EPS growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.Within electrophysiology, we think Boston Scientific is well positioned as a leader in the emerging field of pulsed field ablation (PFA). Traditionally, physicians have used temperature-based methods (either hot or cold) to disable heart tissue responsible for irregular heartbeats. Temperature-based methods may damage surrounding tissue, however. Examples include damaging the esophagus (food tube) and the phrenic nerve (which controls breathing). PFA, in comparison, relies on electricity to damage aberrant tissue, and because different types of tissue have different electrical thresholds, the surrounding tissue can be selectively spared. Boston Scientific is ahead of the pack with high-quality, randomized controlled trial data (Advent) to come out in the back half of 2023. Electrophysiology is an $8 billion market growing 12%, and we believe Boston Scientific can grow significantly above this market rate as it takes share with its PFA program.Within structural heart, we like Boston Scientific’s position within left atrial appendage closure, which is a procedure that lowers stroke risk for atrial fibrillation patients. The company’s Watchman device continues to maintain dominant share (over 90%), and this is a $1 billion market growing over 25%. We are most excited about the potential for Watchman to expand into first-line therapy: currently patients would only get a Watchman if they cannot take anticoagulants because of bleeding risk; Boston Scientific is running the CHAMPION-AF trial to support Watchman as the first option. It has completed enrollment, and if the trial is successful, the company believes this has the potential to more than triple the addressable patients by 2027.""Story continues10 Countries Accepting Indian Medical DegreesDmitry Kalinovsky/Shutterstock.comBoston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

This is expected to enable both remediation and a return to full commercial operations for the comprehensive infusion system in the United States.The latest FDA clearance is expected to significantly solidify its foothold in the infusion system market in the United States and strengthen its Medical segment.Few Words on the Infusion SystemThe latest clearance covers updated hardware features for Point-of-Care Unit, large-volume pumps and syringe pumps, among others. It also covers a new BD Alaris Infusion System software version with enhanced cybersecurity and interoperability features, enabling smart and connected care with the most widely used electronic medical record (EMR) systems.The BD Alaris Infusion System can also feed data to the BD HealthSight platform for enterprise medication management. With this platform, health systems can view infusion status in real-time and access an intuitive knowledge portal with actionable information related to clinician trends and drug and fluid libraries.Significance of the ApprovalPer BD, the updated BD Alaris Infusion System will empower hospitals and health systems to optimize their workflows and deliver a higher standard of care despite staffing shortages and resource constraints. BD also believes that a comprehensive infusion system will enable hospitals and health systems to easily scale their infusion needs across an entire integrated delivery network and provide interoperability with EMRs.BD’s management believes that the FDA’s 510(k) comprehensive clearance of the updated BD Alaris Infusion System will likely meet the critical infusion needs. Management also added that the features and enhancements incorporated into the updated BD Alaris Infusion System are expected to reinforce BD’s advancements in smart, connected care to benefit clinicians and patients and help improve healthcare system efficiency via better care coordination and utilization of actionable information.Story continuesFY23 Outlook UpdatedBD expects to begin shipping devices and recognizing revenues in fiscal 2024 and does not expect any material incremental revenue contribution from the BD Alaris Infusion System for the remainder of fiscal 2023.

Factors like the increased incidences of chronic diseases, the growing elderly population and the rising surge for ambulatory infusion pumps are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory approval is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Notable Developments in Medical ArmIn May, BD announced expanded customer availability of an all-in-one pre-filled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit, BD PosiFlush SafeScrub.

HQY has been gaining from its unique investment platform. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strength in Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are expected to contribute further. However, data security issues and a tough competitive landscape are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 6.5% against the 11.5% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 14.4% growth in the said time frame.The renowned provider of technology-enabled services platforms for healthcare savings and spending decisions has a market capitalization of $5.36 billion. The company projects 22% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. HealthEquity’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 9.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Unique Investment Platform: We are optimistic about HealthEquity’s multiple cloud-based platforms, accessed by its members online via a desktop or mobile device. Individuals can make health-saving and spending decisions and pay healthcare bills, among other activities, via these platforms. These platforms provide users access to services HealthEquity provides as well as services provided by third parties selected by HealthEquity or its Network Partners. Among other features, HealthEquity’s HSA platform has the capability to provide users with medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details such as the amount paid by insurance.Strength in HSA: HealthEquity’s total number of HSAs, as of Apr 30, 2023, rose 9.3% year over year. HealthEquity reported 556,000 HSAs with investments as of Apr 30, 2023, up 9.9% year over year. Total Accounts, as of Apr 30, 2023, were up 3.8% year over year. This uptick included total HSAs and 6.9 million other consumer-directed benefits (CDBs). Total HSA assets were up 10.1% year over year at the end of Apr 30, 2023.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: HealthEquity saw solid top-line and bottom-line performances in first-quarter fiscal 2024. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. The expansion of both margins was also seen.DownsidesStiff Competition: HealthEquity faces stiff competition in the Medical Services market, which is rapidly evolving and fragmented. The company’s success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of HSAs and other CDBs, and its ability to increase engagement and demonstrate the value of its services to existing and potential clients, Network Partners and members.Data Security Issues: HealthEquity deals with a high level of sensitive personal data and information. Any security breaches might result in the loss of sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation or indemnity obligations to the customers. The company’s ability to ensure the security of its technology platforms and, thus, sensitive customer and partner information is critical to its operations.Estimate TrendHealthEquity has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.86 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on August 1, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.86 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.82 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of 2.34%.ZBH is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Boston Scientific (BSX) as well.Boston Scientific, which is readying to report earnings on July 27, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.49 a share, and BSX is three days out from its next earnings report.For Boston Scientific, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.49 is 0.47%.Story continuesZBH and BSX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out the 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.In the first half of 2023, global economic growth picked up pace, reaching 2.8%. Up to this point, the impact of monetary tightening was balanced by the diminishing supply shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, since 2022, the surge in global policy rates by approximately 400 basis points (bps) has begun to affect interest-sensitive spending and impede factory output. Despite the current momentum, the fading resiliency of the global economy suggests that growth moderation is likely unavoidable. Speaking of the United States specifically, J.P. Morgan Research expects the country to undergo a mild recession towards the end of 2023. This prediction comes from the Federal Reserve's adoption of a restrictive policy stance, which is expected to lead to tighter credit conditions, consequently dragging down the economy.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan., stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to economists at Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25% from their previous projection of 35%, which was made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Research projects a robust annual average growth of 1.8% for this year, surpassing the consensus among private-sector economists and the projections made by the Federal Reserve.Story continuesIn the realm of investing, volatility holds significant importance. It becomes evident to investors during market downturns when certain individual stocks, characterized by higher volatility, undergo substantial price fluctuations. Additionally, it serves as a proxy for risk; higher volatility often implies a riskier portfolio. As an example, certain sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are known for being less volatile than others, making them potentially safer investment options during times of recession. Business Insider's report indicated that the consumer staples industry had outperformed the overall market by an impressive 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015, with much of this outperformance observed during recessionary periods. Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average experienced only a marginal decline of 1.4% in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 faced a substantial 19.4% decrease during the same period.See also: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowAs the first half of this year came to a close, the market received a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report. This has led some to question the need for acquiring the safer holdings as the overall market sentiment remains strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors. Although investors may be inclined to favor riskier securities with higher potential returns in such a market environment, it is important to realize that the market can shift and turn at any moment. In that regard, low volatility stocks serve as safe harbors for investors who are averse to turbulent market swings. Their comparatively steady performance not only aids in minimizing losses during downturns but also prevents hasty panic selling that could jeopardize one's retirement savings. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some low volatility stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), among others listed below.12 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected the following low risk stocks suitable based on optimistic analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The betas for these firms were below 1.0 as of July 19, which means these stocks are less risky as compared to the broader market. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.12. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Beta Value: 0.62Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a prominent American corporation renowned as one of the largest producers and marketers of tobacco, cigarettes, and related products worldwide. Its global operations are based in Henrico County, Virginia. With an impressive 54-year streak of dividend increases, few companies are as experienced as Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) in effectively navigating market downturns.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were long Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) at the end of the first quarter of 2023, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Natixis Global Asset Management's Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 6.33 million shares worth $282.77 million.Much like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a smart low volatility stock that investors should take note of.11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Beta Value: 0.35Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), commonly known as Verizon, is an American multinational telecommunication conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the first quarter of 2023, the telecommunications firm reported an increase of 633,000 subscribers.On June 1, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 1, to shareholders of record on July 10.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Billionaire Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $188.5 million.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Beta Value: 0.54Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a major American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. The company is a global leader in the beverage industry, and is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $77 to $74 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Although the analyst perceives KO as a stronger defensive stock during inflationary periods compared to its historical performance, he expresses near-term apprehension concerning the ongoing tax litigation.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”9. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.64McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 46 years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.52 per share and its dividend yield on July 19 stood at 2.07%.On April 25, the company released its most recent fiscal quarter results, surpassing the consensus earnings forecast. The revenue exhibited a notable 4% year-over-year growth, exceeding the consensus revenue forecast by over $300 million, while the adjusted EPS expanded from $2.28 to $2.63.At the end of Q1 2023, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), up from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $4 billion. With over 1.64 million shares, Paul Marshall And Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was the company’s leading stakeholder.8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Beta Value: 0.35Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, the company is renowned developing and manufacturing medicines and vaccines spanning various fields, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. Notably, in 2022, Pfizer's top-performing product was the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, which generated an impressive $37.8 billion in alliance revenues and direct sales.The biotech company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 13 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.50%, as of July 19.At the end of March 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), worth collectively roughly $2.2 billion. Of these, Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest shareholder, with total stakes worth approximately $380.28 million.7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.54AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) operates as a specialized biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of drugs designed to address chronic and complex diseases. The company is best known for manufacturing its blockbuster drug Humira — a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.With a record of 50 years of continuous dividend growth, the American pharmaceutical company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with yield of 4.30% as of July 19.As of the close of Q1 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q1.Harding Loevner mentioned AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.41The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On June 11, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The company has consistently raised its dividends for 67 years. During fiscal Q3 2023, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) recorded a 3.5% year-over-year growth in revenue, amounting to $20.07 billion. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on the Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is a low volatility stock that hedge funds are piling into.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.Suggested articles:12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $2510 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $1010 Best One Dollar Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

If you want to skip our primer on the benefits of sustainable investment, then head on over to 5 Sustainable Investing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Investing often involves evaluating a firm's business operations and the broader environment to see whether it will generate value in the future to justify the allocation of existing funds. Sustainable investing expands this basic principle to also consider the impact of a firm's operations on the environment, society, and stakeholders. The list of these stakeholders includes shareholders, customers, employees, and any other group of individuals that might face direct or indirect effects from the business.Including this broader set of factors narrows down the pool of firms that are available for investment, and a hot topic surrounding ESG (Environmental, Social, &amp; Governance) investing is whether shareholders receive adequate returns. Massive amounts of money have already been poured into exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in sustainable firms, and estimates from Morningstar show that a sizeable $2.74 trillion was invested in this segment at Q4 2021 end. This time period was marked by a recovery of sorts in the global investment climate since in the prior year's Q4, the total investment was a trillion dollars lower and stood at $1.65 trillion. Flows in the funds have continued to recover, but the disruption of 2022 in a high interest rate and inflation environment has stalled the overall recovery.So when it comes to returns, it turns out that sustainable or unsustainable investing really doesn't have that much of a difference. Research shows that comparing the returns of low sustainability funds with their high sustainability counterparts does not yield a significant difference, and researchers from Columbia Business School have a rather stunning conclusion that shows that investing in highly rated ESG companies might actually be counterproductive in achieving stakeholder friendly outcomes. This paper analyzed more than 300 ESG funds available to U.S. investors and concluded that companies part of ESG funds were more likely to commit violations such as employee health and safety endangerment, wage theft, and a statistically insignificant difference in the rate of environmental regulations violations.Story continuesHowever, ESG investment has made quite an impact when it comes to the operations of large companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Between 2004 and 2015, the firm reduced its water intensity (the amount of water that it uses to make a liter of coke) by 26.6% or from 2.7 liters to 1.98 liters. Consulting firm McKinsey is also a fan of sustainable investing, as it believes that through this investors can create value in five areas. These cover top line revenue growth by attracting customers that value ESG products and using credibility as a responsible firm to leverage a community for better resource access, to saving up on costs like Coca-Cola, and investing in long term assets that are able to pay off their capital expenditure before being written off and becoming a burden on the environment.After all, the goal of sustainable investing is to improve the world and then make profits according to the strictest adherents. And the returns are nearly similar as well, since when we look at the returns of the broader MSCI ACWI Index and compare them to the MSCI ACWI ESG Universal Index we find out that over the past ten years, the former has delivered 8.75% in annualized returns while the latter's returns have stood higher at 9.12%. So while sustainable investment might not lead to explosive growth, it still performs nearly the same when analyzed in a limited scope. After all, returns of the S&amp;P 500 are higher over the same time period, as these stand at 12.22% on an annualized basis as of June 30, 2023. And for another small win for the ESG crowd, the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index has posted 12.83% in net total return over the same time period, similar to the returns of the S&amp;P 500 ESG Leaders Index - an index that excludes sectors such as tobacco, alcohol, nuclear power, and fossil fuels.So, the next question to ask is which firms are highly rated when it comes to ESG. Well, we took a look and found out that out of the Top 12 ESG Companies in 2022, the top three that plan to pump millions of dollars into making their operations sustainable and foster a sustainable business environment are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). As to what makes these firms special? Well, Intel, a company whose operations require using copious amounts of water for high product purity, saved 9.6 billion gallons of water in 2022 and upgraded its electricity usage in the U.S., E.U., Israel, and Malaysia to 100% renewable. Microsoft, on the other hand, aims to be water positive and carbon neutral by the end of this decade and upgraded its Microsoft Cloud platform to expand data gathering for ESG reporting and analysis in June 2023.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top sustainable stocks to invest in according to billionaires. Some notable names are First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH).10 Sustainable Investing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up Onrawfilm-ihMzQV3lleo-unsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of billionaire sustainable stock picks we first used the Invesco MSCI Sustainable Future ETF and picked out the top forty companies.

SAM is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27. In the second quarter, the company is anticipated to have registered top and bottom-line declines from the prior-year quarter’s reported figures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.45 per share, suggesting a decline of 20% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has declined 3.9% in the past seven days. For quarterly revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $598.8 million, suggesting a 2.8% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.In the last reported quarter, SAM delivered a negative earnings surprise of 128.1%. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 88.7%, on average.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteBoston Beer has been witnessing declines in shipments and depletions, as well as continued challenges in the hard seltzer category. This has been weighing on the company’s top-line performance. For the second quarter of 2023, the company anticipated shipments to be at the low end of the company’s 2023 guidance of a 2-8% decline, backed by the launch of Truly Margarita.Our model estimates shipment volumes to decline 4.1% in the second quarter. Depletions for the second quarter are expected to be down 1%.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management indicated that the company’s second quarter results would remain sensitive to changes in volume projections, mostly related to the hard seltzer category, supply-chain performance and inflationary impacts. It anticipated slowed hard seltzer sales to mainly impact SAM’s Truly hard seltzer performance, which is expected to continue through the first half of 2023.Continued headwinds from increased costs are expected to have marred the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Inflationary packaging, ingredient and energy costs, elevated inventory obsolescence costs, and higher brewery processing have been weighing on the gross margin in recent quarters.Sluggishness in the hard seltzer category, an unfavorable product mix and supply-chain inefficiencies are expected to have affected Boston Beer’s performance in the quarter under review. Further, higher advertising, promotional and selling expenses are likely to have continued spoiling its performance.We expect the second-quarter adjusted operating margin to decline 300 basis points to 8.7%, driven by a 60-bps increase in advertising, promotional and selling expenses.However, continued strength across the Beyond Beer portfolio is likely to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Beyond Beer is growing faster than the traditional beer market, and SAM expects this trend to continue for the next several years. Gains of this trend are likely to get reflected in the company’s second-quarter results.SAM’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation, growth of non-beer categories and brand development is likely to have boosted its operational performance and position in the market. Its focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential bodes well. As part of product innovation, the company expects to improve the Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on core business, smart brand innovation, and strong distributor support and retail execution.Boston Beer’s commitment to the three-point growth plan — focus on reviving its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives and innovation — is expected to have contributed to its quarterly performance.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boston Beer this time around.

405,160fd4a1-c203-33bb-a1ef-b925df12aa66,MHK,2023-07-25,Mohawk Industries (MHK) Shows Fast-paced Momentum But Is Still a Bargain Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mohawk-industries-mhk-shows-fast-125006041.html,1690203006,STORY,['MHK'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Mohawk Industries (MHK) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 12.8%, the stock of this flooring maker is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MHK meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 4.2% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MHK is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.3. This indicates that the stock moves 30% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that MHK has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MHK earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MHK is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MHK is currently trading at 0.61 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 61 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MHK appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MHK, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

406,d0e1eb6c-0266-3a87-b45b-6468438c7008,WY,2023-07-25,Potlatch (PCH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/potlatch-pch-expected-beat-earnings-140037698.html,1690207237,STORY,['WY'],"[The market expects Potlatch (PCH) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis timberland owner and wood products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -94.4%.Revenues are expected to be $230.63 million, down 35.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Potlatch?For Potlatch, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +11.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Potlatch will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Potlatch would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.23, delivering a surprise of +91.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Potlatch appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Building Products - Wood industry, Weyerhaeuser (WY) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.21 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -80.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.03 billion, down 31.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Weyerhaeuser has been revised 2.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Weyerhaeuser will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

407,ce59132b-adb4-35f6-9e84-dde14e4f13b6,WM,2023-07-25,"Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-inc-nyse-wm-110125348.html,1690282885,STORY,['WM'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Waste Management How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:33% = US$2.3b ÷ US$6.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.33 in profit.Does Waste Management Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Waste Management has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesWaste Management's Debt And Its 33% ROEWaste Management clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.15. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

This compares to earnings of $5.97 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.79%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Maytag, KitchenAid and other appliances would post earnings of $2.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.66, delivering a surprise of 24.30%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Whirlpool , which belongs to the Zacks Household Appliances industry, posted revenues of $4.79 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.13%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.1 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Whirlpool shares have added about 5.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.2%.What's Next for Whirlpool?While Whirlpool has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Whirlpool: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.44 on $4.92 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $16.23 on $19.57 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Household Appliances is currently in the bottom 3% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Skechers (SKX), another stock in the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on July 27.This shoe company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.3%.

supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as ""ongoing"" measures. These measures may include earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), EBIT margin, ongoing EBIT, ongoing EBIT margin, ongoing earnings per diluted share, adjusted effective tax rate, organic net sales, gross debt leverage (Gross Debt/Ongoing EBITDA), return on invested capital (ROIC) and free cash flow.Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.Sales excluding foreign currency: Current period net sales translated in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the applicable prior period's exchange rate compared to the applicable prior period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations.Organic net sales: Sales excluding the impact of certain acquisitions or divestitures, and foreign currency. Management believes that organic net sales provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and certain acquisitions and/or divestitures.Ongoing EBIT margin: Ongoing earnings before interest and taxes divided by net sales. Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.Ongoing earnings per diluted share: Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations. Ongoing measures provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses.Gross debt leverage: Gross debt to ongoing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio is gross debt outstanding, including long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and notes payable, divided by ongoing EBITDA. Management believes that gross debt leverage provides stockholders with a view of our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt.Return on invested capital: Ongoing EBIT after taxes divided by total invested capital, defined as total assets less non-interest bearing current liabilities (NIBCLS). NIBCLS is defined as current liabilities less current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable. This ROIC definition may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. Management believes that ROIC provides stockholders with a view of capital efficiency, a key driver of stockholder value creation.Adjusted effective tax rate: Effective tax rate, excluding pre-tax income and tax effect of certain unique items. Management believes that adjusted tax rate provides stockholders with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of certain unique items.Free cash flow: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations.Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its forward-looking long-term value creation goals, such as organic net sales, EBIT, free cash flow conversion, ROIC and gross debt leverage, as these long-term management goals are not annual guidance, and the reconciliation of these long-term measures would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company's control.We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These ongoing financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share, net earnings, net earnings available to Whirlpool, net earnings margin, return on assets, net sales, effective tax rate and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.We also disclose segment EBIT as an important financial metric used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280 - Segment Reporting.GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool per basic or diluted share (as applicable) and ongoing earnings per diluted share are presented net of tax, while individual adjustments in each reconciliation are presented on a pre-tax basis; the income tax impact line item aggregates the tax impact for these adjustments. The tax impact of individual line item adjustments may not foot precisely to the aggregate income tax impact amount, as each line item adjustment may include non-taxable components. Historical quarterly earnings per share amounts are presented based on a normalized tax rate adjustment to reconcile quarterly tax rates to full-year tax rate expectations. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.SECOND-QUARTER 2023 ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHAREThe reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool and net earnings (loss) per diluted share available to Whirlpool, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.

IMPACT OF M&amp;A TRANSACTIONS - On January 16, 2023, we signed a contribution agreement to contribute our European major domestic appliance business into a newly formed entity with Arçelik. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a non-cash loss on disposal of $240 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, of which $18 million was recorded during the second quarter, resulting in a total loss of $1,761 million for the transaction.Additionally, we have incurred other unique transaction related costs related to portfolio transformation for a total of $8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. These transaction costs are recorded in Selling, General and Administrative expenses on our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).During the second quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Russia business. We classified this disposal group as held for sale and recorded an impairment loss of $346 million for the write-down of the net assets to their fair value. Additionally, we incurred unique transaction related costs of $17 million related to portfolio transformation and EMEA strategic assessment expenses.b.LEGACY EMEA LEGAL MATTERS - The aggregate amount accrued by the Company related to the Competition Investigation and other legacy legal matters of our European major domestic appliance business was $36 million and $98 million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.c. NORMALIZED TAX RATE ADJUSTMENT - During the second quarter of 2023, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of 10.9%, which excludes the non-tax deductible impact of M&amp;A transactions of approximately $26 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023, to reconcile to our anticipated full-year ongoing effective tax rate between 10.0% and 15.0%. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of 18.8% to reconcile to our anticipated full-year ongoing 2022 effective tax rate between 21% and 23%. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of 15.0%, which excludes the non-tax deductible impact of M&amp;A transactions of approximately $222 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023, to reconcile to our anticipated full-year ongoing effective tax rate between 14.0% and 16.0%.d.IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES - During the second quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of the EMEA region's goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. Based on our interim quantitative impairment assessment as of June 30, 2022, we concluded the carrying value of the EMEA reporting unit exceeded its fair value,  therefore goodwill and intangible assets were impaired. The impact of the impairment was $106 million to intangible assets and $278 million to goodwill in the second quarter of 2022. ORGANIC NET SALESThe reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure organic net sales to GAAP reported net sales, for three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 for the Whirlpool EMEA business.Three Months EndedJune 30(Approximate impact in millions)20222023ChangeNet Sales $           1,008$               854(15.3) %Less: Russia Divested Business51—Less: Currency—10Organic Net Sales$               957$               844(11.8) %Note: Numbers may not reconcile due to rounding FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow is cash provided by (used in) operating activities after capital expenditures.

Revenue was down 6% from the same time last year, to $4.79 billion. Analysts had forecast $4.81B in sales.Part of the reason for the sales drop from last year was the comparatively lower promotional activity in 2022, the company said. That activity has returned to more normalized pre-pandemic levels. Sales rose 3.1% from the first quarter.The company still sees adjusted earnings per share for 2023 of $16 to $18 and revenue of $19.4B, slightly ahead of expectations.CEO Marc Bitzer said: “Our portfolio transformation towards a higher-growth, higher margin business is well underway, and we are well-positioned to benefit from housing-driven demand recovery, including now having 8 of the top 10 national builders as trade customers.""Related ArticlesWhirlpool shares dip after profit beats expectations but sales dropApple faces $1 billion UK lawsuit by apps developers over app store feesLVMH strikes Paris Olympic Games sponsorship deal]"

MRI machines accounted for more than half of those sales, while $839 million came from ultrasound devices.The company raised its annual adjusted profit forecast by 10 cents at both ends of its range. It now expects a 2023 profit of $3.70 to $3.85 per share, above expectations of $3.74 per share at the mid-point.Excluding items, GE HealthCare earned 92 cents per share in the quarter, surpassing estimates of 87 cents, according to Refinitiv data.Shares of the former GE unit rose pared early gains to trade down nearly 2%.(Reporting by Khushi Mandowara in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Anil D'Silva)]"

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study General Electric's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for General Electric How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:25% = US$8.4b ÷ US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.General Electric's Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that General Electric has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 27% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 51% net income growth seen by General Electric was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared General Electric's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 37%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about General Electric's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is General Electric Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?General Electric's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.9%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Moreover, General Electric is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 6.2%. However, General Electric's future ROE is expected to decline to 14% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that General Electric's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

426,040fe09e-e096-385f-bb56-3eebadbb2155,VLO,2023-07-25,The 150% return delivered to Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) shareholders actually lagged YoY earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/150-return-delivered-valero-energys-110055319.html,1690282855,STORY,['VLO'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For example, the Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) share price has soared 117% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. And in the last month, the share price has gained 13%. But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 5.3% in the last month.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Valero Energy achieved compound earnings per share growth of 232% per year. The average annual share price increase of 29% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 3.33 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Valero Energy has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Valero Energy the TSR over the last 3 years was 150%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Valero Energy shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 6% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Valero Energy  that you should be aware of.But note: Valero Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

427,26a68eb1-97c5-3d4c-af93-525d26636f4f,VLO,2023-07-25,Earnings Preview: CVR Energy (CVI) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-cvr-energy-cvi-140030953.html,1690207230,STORY,"['CVI', 'VLO']","[The market expects CVR Energy (CVI) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis diversified holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -51%.Revenues are expected to be $2.36 billion, down 25.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.41% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CVR?For CVR, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CVR will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CVR would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.44, delivering a surprise of +51.58%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CVR doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsValero Energy (VLO), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $5.08 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -55.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $34.82 billion, down 32.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Valero Energy has been revised 1.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Management noted strong volumes and activity in orthopedic procedures such as hips and knees as well as stronger care activity in behavioral health. Management further noted this heightened level of care activity could be attributed to pent-up demand as COVID-related mask mandates have finally been dropped and people have become more comfortable accessing health care services they might have delayed during the height of the pandemic. In addition, management cited less capacity constraints in the system. The result of this increased activity led management to raise guidance for the company’s medical loss ratio to the upper half of the existing guidance range. This commentary by management of the bellwether in the industry led to pressure on managed care stocks broadly, while the stocks of health care providers and medical device companies rallied on the expectation for strong medical procedure volumes.Managed care stocks have been under pressure all year, due to heightened political and regulatory scrutiny of the Medicare Advantage program and the pharmacy benefit management industry, less favorable Medicare Advantage rates for 2024, and higher medical cost trends. UnitedHealth management noted they caught the trend in time to incorporate higher medical cost trends into their pricing for 2024 Medicare Advantage bids. However, questions remain whether this increased utilization of the health care system is a temporary spike or the beginning of a sustained level of activity. We continue to own UnitedHealth, Humana Inc., and Elevance Health, Inc. because we believe these companies will be able to manage through this period without a material earnings impact, but we did modestly reduce our positions in Humana and Elevance Health.”Story continues15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The WorldUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is in 16th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

430,4b463468-3faa-3ce9-ab9b-a683e03fcc16,EL,2023-07-25,The Returns On Capital At Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) Don't Inspire Confidence,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-est-e-lauder-110059409.html,1690282859,STORY,['EL'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Estée Lauder Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$1.9b ÷ (US$23b - US$7.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 13%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured Estée Lauder Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Estée Lauder Companies doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 25% over the last five years. Given the business is employing more capital while revenue has slipped, this is a bit concerning.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out the 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.In the first half of 2023, global economic growth picked up pace, reaching 2.8%. Up to this point, the impact of monetary tightening was balanced by the diminishing supply shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, since 2022, the surge in global policy rates by approximately 400 basis points (bps) has begun to affect interest-sensitive spending and impede factory output. Despite the current momentum, the fading resiliency of the global economy suggests that growth moderation is likely unavoidable. Speaking of the United States specifically, J.P. Morgan Research expects the country to undergo a mild recession towards the end of 2023. This prediction comes from the Federal Reserve's adoption of a restrictive policy stance, which is expected to lead to tighter credit conditions, consequently dragging down the economy.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Global Head of Equity Macro Strategy at J.P. Morgan., stated:“Given that multiple expansion has been the main driver of performance year to date, we see unattractive risk-reward for equities and increasing investor complacency ahead of our expectation that the business cycle will further decelerate in the second half of the year, with the onset of a recession likely in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024. What’s more, consumers are starting to show signs of weakness, and there is a risk that liquidity and credit conditions could tighten in the coming months.”According to economists at Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25% from their previous projection of 35%, which was made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. Additionally, Goldman Sachs Research projects a robust annual average growth of 1.8% for this year, surpassing the consensus among private-sector economists and the projections made by the Federal Reserve.Story continuesIn the realm of investing, volatility holds significant importance. It becomes evident to investors during market downturns when certain individual stocks, characterized by higher volatility, undergo substantial price fluctuations. Additionally, it serves as a proxy for risk; higher volatility often implies a riskier portfolio. As an example, certain sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are known for being less volatile than others, making them potentially safer investment options during times of recession. Business Insider's report indicated that the consumer staples industry had outperformed the overall market by an impressive 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015, with much of this outperformance observed during recessionary periods. Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average experienced only a marginal decline of 1.4% in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 faced a substantial 19.4% decrease during the same period.See also: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowAs the first half of this year came to a close, the market received a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report. This has led some to question the need for acquiring the safer holdings as the overall market sentiment remains strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors. Although investors may be inclined to favor riskier securities with higher potential returns in such a market environment, it is important to realize that the market can shift and turn at any moment. In that regard, low volatility stocks serve as safe harbors for investors who are averse to turbulent market swings. Their comparatively steady performance not only aids in minimizing losses during downturns but also prevents hasty panic selling that could jeopardize one's retirement savings. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some low volatility stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), among others listed below.12 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected the following low risk stocks suitable based on optimistic analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The betas for these firms were below 1.0 as of July 19, which means these stocks are less risky as compared to the broader market. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.12. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Beta Value: 0.62Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a prominent American corporation renowned as one of the largest producers and marketers of tobacco, cigarettes, and related products worldwide. Its global operations are based in Henrico County, Virginia. With an impressive 54-year streak of dividend increases, few companies are as experienced as Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) in effectively navigating market downturns.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were long Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) at the end of the first quarter of 2023, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Natixis Global Asset Management's Harris Associates held the largest stake in the company, with 6.33 million shares worth $282.77 million.Much like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) is a smart low volatility stock that investors should take note of.11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Beta Value: 0.35Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), commonly known as Verizon, is an American multinational telecommunication conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the first quarter of 2023, the telecommunications firm reported an increase of 633,000 subscribers.On June 1, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 1, to shareholders of record on July 10.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Billionaire Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.8 million shares worth $188.5 million.10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Beta Value: 0.54Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a major American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. The company is a global leader in the beverage industry, and is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $77 to $74 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Although the analyst perceives KO as a stronger defensive stock during inflationary periods compared to its historical performance, he expresses near-term apprehension concerning the ongoing tax litigation.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”9. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Beta Value: 0.64McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 46 years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.52 per share and its dividend yield on July 19 stood at 2.07%.On April 25, the company released its most recent fiscal quarter results, surpassing the consensus earnings forecast. The revenue exhibited a notable 4% year-over-year growth, exceeding the consensus revenue forecast by over $300 million, while the adjusted EPS expanded from $2.28 to $2.63.At the end of Q1 2023, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), up from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively worth over $4 billion. With over 1.64 million shares, Paul Marshall And Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was the company’s leading stakeholder.8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Beta Value: 0.35Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, the company is renowned developing and manufacturing medicines and vaccines spanning various fields, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. Notably, in 2022, Pfizer's top-performing product was the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, which generated an impressive $37.8 billion in alliance revenues and direct sales.The biotech company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 13 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.50%, as of July 19.At the end of March 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), worth collectively roughly $2.2 billion. Of these, Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest shareholder, with total stakes worth approximately $380.28 million.7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.54AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) operates as a specialized biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of drugs designed to address chronic and complex diseases. The company is best known for manufacturing its blockbuster drug Humira — a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.With a record of 50 years of continuous dividend growth, the American pharmaceutical company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with yield of 4.30% as of July 19.As of the close of Q1 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q1.Harding Loevner mentioned AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“One of our two new additions to the portfolio is AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), a US drugmaker best known for Humira, a medicine used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is building upon its maturing blockbuster Humira business by expanding its stable of autoimmune-disorder treatments with launches such as Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been well received and should support continued growth. Separately, we believe the slowdown in venture capital funding may foster more collaboration between biotechnology companies with promising, early-stage pipelines and large pharmaceutical companies. This may allow AbbVie to supplement its own pipeline at cheaper valuations than biotechs had commanded in recent years.”6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Beta Value: 0.41The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On June 11, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The company has consistently raised its dividends for 67 years. During fiscal Q3 2023, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) recorded a 3.5% year-over-year growth in revenue, amounting to $20.07 billion. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on the Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), like Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), is a low volatility stock that hedge funds are piling into.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy Now.Suggested articles:12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $2510 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $1010 Best One Dollar Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. In light of that, from a first glance at Stericycle (NASDAQ:SRCL), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Stericycle:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.048 = US$228m ÷ (US$5.3b - US$581m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Stericycle has an ROCE of 4.8%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 8.5%. View our latest analysis for Stericycle roceIn the above chart we have measured Stericycle's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of Stericycle's historical ROCE trend, it isn't fantastic. The company used to generate 8.1% on its capital five years ago but it has since fallen noticeably. In addition to that, Stericycle is now employing 21% less capital than it was five years ago. The combination of lower ROCE and less capital employed can indicate that a business is likely to be facing some competitive headwinds or seeing an erosion to its moat. Typically businesses that exhibit these characteristics aren't the ones that tend to multiply over the long term, because statistically speaking, they've already gone through the growth phase of their life cycle.Story continuesOur Take On Stericycle's ROCEIn short, lower returns and decreasing amounts capital employed in the business doesn't fill us with confidence. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 33% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.Stericycle does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning...While Stericycle isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United Airlines UAL, Delta Air Lines DAL and American Airlines AAL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Finally, after a scorching hot July for most of the country as well as the stock market, things have cooled a bit. A two-day pullback on Wall Street has folks reaching for their shopping list. That means that plenty of the names which were pushing up through all-time highs in the middle of last week have come down off their highs. You may be tempted to jump in and buy everything with both hands. You have to make sure you look before you leap. Not every name out there is worth your hard-earned cash.One way to mitigate your long-term risk is by buying stocks with strong earnings trends. Lucky for you, the Zacks Rank offers up a cheat sheet, a Cliff’s Notes of sorts to get right to the root of the issue. Stocks in the good graces of our Zacks Rank have the strongest earnings trends when compared to the rest of the broad market.Oshkosh is currently in the good graces of our Zacks Rank, checking in with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Established in 1917, WI-based Oshkosh Corporation is a producer and seller of a varied range of vehicle bodies and specialty vehicles. It is also engaged in equipment financing and leasing solutions for its customers, primarily through third-party funding arrangements.The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is that over the last week alone, analysts have come out and increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, next quarter, and current year. Look back over the last thirty days, and you’ll see analysts also increasing their estimates for next year. The bullish moves have pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $5.53 to $6.11 while next year’s number is up from $7.50 to $7.62.Story continuesThat $6.11 current year Zacks Consensus Estimate is good for 76.59% growth, with next year coming in at 24.71%. That’s on sales growth of 5.5% this year and 5% next year.Bear of the Day:There’s no question that the stock market has been red hot. All year, tech stocks have been screaming off the lows. There was a big bump in the road though. That bump came in the way of some very high-profile negativity in the banking sector. Most notably, smaller regional banks took an absolute dive after the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank.For the astute investor, it was a great time to come in and scoop up some bank stocks off the lows. It was truly a “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” scenario, as so many great banks lost tons in market value. Now that the dust has settled, a lot of those banks have rallied back to pre-panic levels. It may feel tempting to run out and buy more bank shares.Look for banks with the strongest earnings trends and try to avoid those with the weakest trends. It could mean that profits are at risk in the intermediate term. One such stock is today’s Bear of the Day, Eagle Bancorp. EAGLE BANCORP is the holding company for EagleBank. The Bank is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, and conducts full service commercial banking services through nine offices, located in Montgomery County, Maryland and Washington, D.C. The Company focuses on building relationships with businesses, professionals and individuals in its marketplace.Eagle is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Banks – Northeast industry which ranks in the Bottom 4% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The reason for the unfavorable rank is that over the last thirty days, analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current quarter, next quarter, current year and next year. The bearish sentiment has cut our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year down from $4.47 to $2.93 while next year’s number is off from $4.50 to $3.77.Additional content:What to Make of Airline Earnings So FarResults from some of the leading airline companies are in, and we can identify some broad trends therein.Trend number one is international travel has come roaring back. And it isn’t just the Pacific region, though that is benefiting from China and Japan opening up, as well as alliances with local operators. Although Europe is experiencing heat waves, that doesn’t seem to be deterring travelers. South America too is going strong.The second trend is that the recovery seems to be broad-based, across leisure and business.Pent-up demand for international travel is the strongest driver of leisure travel. The lifting of pandemic-related restrictions and testing is really pushing it, particularly on the international side. The trend is currently expected to continue for a while, as people usually make their travel plans in advance. The hybrid work environment is also a driver for leisure travel because of the flexibility it allows. The segment will also benefit as people divert funds from other discretionary activities to catch up on travel.Business travel is also coming back, as pandemic-related measures are removed. The hybrid work environment is a slight negative for business travel because people are not as easily available to do physical meetings. But this situation continues to evolve and more people continue to come back. 2024 could be when things normalize to a great extent.As far as profitability is concerned, the situation is positive because jet fuel prices have dropped substantially. Additionally, capacity adds have been slower of late as suppliers struggle with supply chain issues, labor costs, etc. Limited capacity and surging demand is the recipe for stronger pricing, and lower fuel cost offers flexibility to operators to lower prices without sacrificing margins, if the economy does take a turn for the worse. Airport capacity is also a sticking factor, and this is leading to increased demand for widebody aircraft that can carry more passengers per flight. Here's a quick recap of three airlines:United Airlines Holdings, Inc.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company beat the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 26.1%, which came on top of a revenue beat of 1.8%. The full-year guidance for per share earnings was raised by a dollar to $11-$12.The strong results were attributed to ongoing strength in its international business, as it continues to expand its global network and increase connectivity at new locations. In order to make the most of the growing demand in the Pacific region, it announced new flights to Manila, Hong Kong, Taipei and Tokyo. The company has placed the largest ever order for widebody aircraft with Boeing in December last year. Additionally, it has implemented the United Next program to deploy technology and other measures to bring down cost.UAL estimates for 2023 and 20242 are up a respective 5% and 3%.Delta Air Lines, Inc.#2 (Buy) ranked Delta beat the Zacks Consensus revenue estimate by 3.9% and earnings estimate by 10.7%. Management raised the 2023 outlook to $6-$7 and maintained free cash flow expectation of $3 billion.Despite a 17% increase in capacity, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM increased 1%, driven by international passenger revenue, which grew 61%. The greatest strength was in Southern European destinations, but both the Pacific region and South America/Caribbean were also up strongly. Delta is seeing declining non-fuel unit costs as we move through the year, driven by scale efficiencies and double-digit decline in fuel cost.The 2023 estimate is up nearly 21% while the 2024 estimate is up 6% in the last 30 days.American Airlines Group Inc.American Airlines beat on revenue by 2.3% and on earnings by 21.5%. The Zacks Rank #3 company’s full-year earnings guidance was raised to between $3.00 and $3.75 a share.Like the others, American is seeing significant declines in fuel cost. But unlike them, it expects labor costs to increase in the near term (pilots are going to be paid on par with United and flight attendants are looking for 35% pay hikes). The airline also expects a decline in the revenue per seat mile as it runs more flights during the current quarter. Therefore, the near-term outlook spoke to increased uncertainty and hit share prices.AAL estimates are up 5% for 2023 and 3% for 2024 in the last 30 days.Bottom LineThere are several positive factors driving airlines stocks right now, not the least of which is the economic growth we’ve had over the last few years that was not supported by normal business activity. Now that pandemic-era restrictions are lifted, the expansion in the economy should generate growth in travel. While these factors are positive for all airlines, those with international exposure and pricing power are no doubt the ones that will outshine others.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Lowe's (LOW) earns a Zacks Rank #3 29 days from its next quarterly earnings release on August 22, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.50 a share.LOW has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.50 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.49.LOW is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) as well.Slated to report earnings on July 26, 2023, O'Reilly Automotive holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $10.21 a share two days from its next quarterly update.For O'Reilly Automotive, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.05 is 1.57%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LOW and ORLY could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

These factors were partially offset by lower sales volume in the Performance Coatings Group, increased investments in long-term growth initiatives, and higher employee-related costs.As part of a previously announced restructuring plan (Restructuring Plan) to simplify the Company's operating model and reduce costs, the Company completed the divestiture of a non-core domestic aerosol business and announced it had signed a definitive agreement to divest the China architectural business within the Consumer Brands Group during the second quarter of 2023. Diluted net income per share in the quarter included a $0.05 per share impairment charge related to the pending divestiture of the China architectural business, as well as severance and other charges totaling $0.03 per share, offset by a $0.06 per share gain from the divestiture of the non-core domestic aerosol business.

PSG segment profit increased due primarily to higher paint sales volume, selling price increases and moderating raw material costs, partially offset by continued investments in long-term growth strategies and higher employee-related costs.Consumer Brands Group (CBG)Three Months Ended June 30,20232022$ Change % ChangeNet sales$         945.8$         900.0$           45.85.1 %Segment profit$         110.3$           79.9$           30.438.0 %Reported segment margin11.7 %8.9 %Adjusted segment profit (1)$         148.3$           99.0$           49.349.8 %Adjusted segment margin15.7 %11.0 %(1)Adjusted segment profit equals Segment profit excluding the impact of restructuring costs, impairment charges, and acquisition-related amortization expense. Restructuring costs were approximately $13.2 million and impairment charges were $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. Acquisition-related amortization expense was $17.9 million and $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively.Net sales in CBG increased primarily due to selling price increases, which impacted sales by a mid-single digit percentage.  Higher sales volume growth in Latin America and Europe was offset by lower sales volume in North America and Asia. CBG segment profit increased primarily due to selling price increases and moderating raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by inflation in wages and other employee-related costs. Acquisition-related amortization expense reduced segment profit as a percent of net external sales by 190 basis points in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 210 basis points in the second quarter of 2022. Restructuring expense and impairment charges reduced segment profit as a percent of net external sales by 210 basis points in the second quarter of 2023.Performance Coatings Group (PCG)Three Months Ended June 30,20232022$ Change% ChangeNet sales$       1,794.9$       1,790.3$             4.60.3 %Segment profit$         272.7$         196.8$           75.938.6 %Reported segment margin15.2 %11.0 %Adjusted segment profit (1)$         322.3$         247.1$           75.230.4 %Adjusted segment margin18.0 %13.8 %(1)Adjusted segment profit equals Segment profit excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense. Acquisition-related amortization expense was $49.7 million and $50.3 million in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively.Net sales in PCG increased primarily due to selling price increases in all end markets, which increased net sales by a mid-single digit percentage, and incremental sales from acquisitions, largely offset by lower sales volumes in most regions. Acquisitions increased PCG's net sales by 4.5% in the quarter. PCG segment profit increased primarily as a result of selling price increases, moderating raw material costs and effective cost control, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. Acquisition-related amortization expense reduced segment profit as a percent of net external sales by 280 basis points in both the second quarter of 2023 and 2022.LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWThe Company generated $1.29 billion in net operating cash during the first six months of 2023, an increase of 102% compared to the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of higher profit. This strong cash generation allowed the Company to return cash of $848.7 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases of 2.3 million shares of its common stock during the first six months of 2023. At June 30, 2023, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 42.9 million shares of its common stock through open market purchases.2023 GUIDANCE Third QuarterFull Year20232023Net salesUp or down low-single digit %Up low-single digit %Effective tax rateLow twenty percentDiluted net income per share$8.46-$8.86Adjusted diluted net income per share (1)$9.30-$9.70(1)Excludes $0.81 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense and $0.03 per share of restructuring expense.""As a result of our better than expected first half results, and our current visibility into the second half, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year,"" said Mr. Morikis. ""At the same time, our second half comparisons remain challenging, and demand is likely to vary widely by region and end market, leading us to focus even more intensely on our new account and share of wallet initiatives. In the Paint Stores Group, we expect demand to remain solid in commercial, property maintenance, protective and marine and residential repaint. We expect new residential demand to remain soft due to continued slowing of completions, though share gains should enable us to outperform the market. In the Consumer Brands Group, North America DIY demand remains soft, Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets are mixed. In the Performance Coatings Group, North America demand has slowed, and Europe and Asia remain choppy. Even in challenging environments like the current one, we remain confident in our strategy, and we will continue to invest in stores, sales and technical reps, innovation, digital and other growth initiatives to press our advantages now as well as when markets recover more fully. We expect to continue delivering above market growth and returns.""As for our guidance, we expect 2023 third quarter consolidated net sales growth to be up or down a low-single digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, we are increasing both sales and net income per share guidance. We now expect full year consolidated net sales to be up a low-single digit percentage compared to 2022, versus our prior guidance of flat to down a mid-single digit percentage. Our full year diluted net income per share guidance is now $8.46 to $8.86 per share, versus our prior guidance of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. This includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.81 per share and net expense related to the Restructuring Plan of $0.03 per share. Full year 2023 adjusted diluted net income per share is now expected to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.70 per share, compared to our prior guidance of $7.95 to $8.65 per share and $8.73 per share in 2022.""CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATIONThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter, and its outlook for the third quarter and full year 2023, at 11:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, July 25, 2023.

Management provides non-GAAP information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate the Company's operations. Management does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or in substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP.Management believes that investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and items related to the previously announced Restructuring Plan. This adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with US GAAP. It should not be considered a substitute for earnings per share computed in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following tables reconcile diluted net income per share computed in accordance with US GAAP to adjusted diluted net income per share.Year EndingThree Months EndedSix Months EndedDecember 31, 2023June 30, 2023June 30, 2023(after-tax guidance)Pre-TaxTaxEffect (1)After-TaxPre-TaxTaxEffect (1)After-TaxLowHighDiluted net income per share$      3.07$      4.90$      8.46$      8.86Items Related to Restructuring Plan:Severance and other$      0.06$      0.030.03$      0.06$      0.030.03Impairment of assets held for sale0.130.080.050.130.080.05Gain on divestiture of domestic aerosol business(0.08)(0.02)(0.06)(0.08)(0.02)(0.06)Total0.110.090.020.110.090.020.030.03Acquisition-related amortization expense (2)0.260.060.200.530.110.420.810.81Adjusted diluted net income per share$      3.29$      5.34$      9.30$      9.70 Three Months EndedSix Months EndedYear EndedJune 30, 2022June 30, 2022December 31, 2022Pre-TaxTaxEffect (1)After-TaxPre-TaxTaxEffect (1)After-TaxPre-TaxTaxEffect (1)After-TaxDiluted net income per share$    2.21$    3.61$    7.72Restructuring expense:Severance and other——$    0.18$    0.030.15Impairment——0.060.010.05Total——————0.240.040.20Acquisition-related amortization expense (2)$    0.27$    0.070.20$    0.53$    0.120.411.060.250.81Adjusted diluted net income per share$    2.41$    4.02$    8.73(1)The tax effect is calculated based on the statutory rate and the nature of the item.(2)Acquisition-related amortization expense consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition and is included within Selling, general and administrative expenses.Management believes that investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income before income taxes and interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as well as Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain adjustments, such as items related to the previously announced Restructuring Plan. Management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA useful in understanding the operating performance of the Company. The reader is cautioned that the Company's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be compared to other entities unknowingly. Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income or net operating cash as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity.

It pulled off an earnings surprise of 10.9% in the last reported quarter.Sherwin-Williams' shares have risen 3.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 4.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $6,016 million, suggesting a rise of 2.5% from the year-ago reported number.Our estimate for net sales of SHW’s Consumer Brands Group for the second quarter is $874 million, implying a decline of 2.9% year over year. We expect sales of its Performance Coatings Group to be $1,738 million, which indicates a 2.9% decline. Our estimate for SHW’s Paint Stores Group is $3,340 million, which suggests an increase of 5% from the year-ago reported number.Factors to NoteSherwin-Williams is expected to have benefited from its pricing actions to offset cost inflation in raw materials in the second quarter. Additionally, cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are expected to have provided margin benefits. The company is focusing on cost reductions through restructuring, which is projected to save around $50-$70 million annually, with 75% of these savings expected to be realized by the end of 2023.However, softer demand is expected to have unfavorably impacted the company’s second-quarter performance. Sherwin-Williams is facing challenges in the demand environment, with weak demand in new residential and Consumer Brands Group DIY sectors. Sluggish macroeconomic conditions in Europe and China's slow recovery are also impacting demand. The industrial side of the business is under pressure in North America, and the slowdown in the U.S. housing market is affecting the industrial wood business. Despite these challenges, the company's pricing, cost reductions and margin improvement initiatives are expected to have supported its performance in the quarter to be reported.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sherwin-Williams this season.

It may not have been easy to hold on to SHW for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Sherwin-Williams' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Sherwin-Williams' main business drivers.Founded in 1866 and headquartered in Cleveland, OH, The Sherwin-Williams Company is into manufacturing and sales of paints, coatings and related products, primarily in the North and South America. It also has operations in the Caribbean region, Europe and Asia. Sherwin-Williams is one of the biggest paint companies in the United States and in the world. Its well-known brands include Dutch Boy, Minwax and Krylon. The company, on Jun 1, 2017, completed the purchase of rival paints maker Valspar in an all-cash transaction, creating a premier global paints and coatings company.Sherwin-Williams made changes to its reporting structure, effective Jan 1, 2023, to manage and report the Latin America architectural paint business within the Consumer Brands Group. The Latin America business was earlier part of The Americas Group, which has now become the Paint Stores Group as a result of this change. The company started reporting segment results for the newly realigned Paint Stores Group and Consumer Brands Group starting with the first quarter of 2023.The Paint Stores Group: The group produces and sells a wide array of industrial coatings, architectural paint and related products across North America through dedicated dealers and company-operated stores. The segment accounted for around 53% of Sherwin-Williams’ first-quarter 2023 sales.The Consumer Brands Group: The division includes the company’s Consumer Group and Valspar's Consumer Paints segment as well as the Latin America architectural paint business. The segment operates highly efficient supply chain for paints and coatings related products across the globe. The segment accounted for around 16% of Sherwin-Williams’ first-quarter 2023 sales.The Performance Coatings Group: The unit includes the company’s Global Finishes Group and Valspar's Coatings Group coupled with Valspar's Automotive Refinishes products business. It sells a wide array of industrial coatings and finishes for industrial wood, general industrial, protective and marine, packaging and automotive, coil and extrusion customers. The segment accounted for around 31% of Sherwin-Williams’ first-quarter 2023 sales.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Sherwin-Williams a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $4,663.83, or a 366.38% gain, as of July 24, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 168.09% and the price of gold went up 42.91% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for SHW.Earnings estimates for Sherwin-Williams for the second quarter have been stable of late. It is expected to benefit from favorable demand in domestic markets, which will likely support sales volumes in the quarter. Increased sales volumes in the Paint Stores Group division indicate a larger market share. To further expand its market presence, the company is actively expanding its retail operations. In addition to driving sales, the company is implementing cost control initiatives and adopting various supply chain optimization techniques to enhance its margins. These efforts aim to improve operational efficiency and offset rising costs. The acquisition of Valspar has also strengthened its position as a global leader in paints and coatings. It has provided the company with highly complementary offerings, strong brands, and breakthrough technology.The stock is up 8.78% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 4 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This acquisition aligns with American Water Works' growth strategy to expand operations through inorganic means. This acquisition will add nearly 260 water customers and 190 wastewater customers to Missouri American Water’s existing customer base.Since a majority of the existing water and wastewater infrastructure is aging, regular investments are essential for upgrades and maintenance. Large operators like American Water Works, after acquiring small assets, invest in the acquired company’s assets to ensure new customers receive reliable service. Missouri American Water plans to invest $2 million in water and wastewater system improvements for Wood Heights over the next five years.Fragmented Industry Creates BottlenecksA primary headwind in the U.S. water industry is that there are too many small operators with limited financial capabilities. Due to financial constraints, the essential upgrades are, at times, deferred, causing infrastructure failure and resulting in the wastage of precious potable water.Due to many small operators in the business, essential maintenance and upgrades get delayed, disrupting operations. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE"") findings, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States.The consolidation of smaller operators under the large players will ensure proper maintenance and upgrade of water and wastewater infrastructure. American Water Works is quite active in acquiring small units in its service territories as well as expanding operations. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company completed five acquisitions in two states, adding 1,400 new customers.Systematic Investments Essential for the Water SpacePer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated investment of $744 billion is necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water utilities are gradually consolidating and investing in essential upgrades to maintain aging assets.AWK is making regular investments in maintaining its infrastructure. It aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion from 2023 to 2032.Other water utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology.California Water Service plans to invest more than $725 million in capital expenditures through 2024.Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million during 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the past month, American Water Works’ stock has gained 6.1% against the industry’s 32.5% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankAmerican Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Nasdaq Composite remains in view of its 52-week high hit on July 19.To be sure, market strategist bears such as Kolanovic and Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson have a host of fresh stats to support their downtrodden views.First is a mixed start to earnings season, at best.For every strong performer in the mold of a PepsiCo (PEP) and General Motors (GM) (earnings beats, guidance lifts, and solid earnings calls), there have been equal doses of Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) — disappointing overall reports that sent share prices sharply lower.And overall, the earnings season numbers don't look that grand.Among the 20% or so of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported second quarter earnings, sales are on pace for a lackluster 0.2% year-on-year drop. Earnings are tracking lower by 9.3%, according to Evercore ISI data.The average stock price has dropped 1% post the companies' earnings reports.Story continuesMeantime, fresh signs are emerging that overseas economies are far from healthy, another potential reason to doubt the justification of robust stock valuations.Consider this: The latest composite French Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) — a measure of economic activity — hit a 32-month low. Germany's composite PMI just reached an eight-month low. Overall, Eurozone PMIs are at eight-month lows.Bronze sculptures depicting a bull and bear stand in front of the stock market in Frankfurt, Germany, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2019. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Finally, the most recent reads on China's economy have also been soft, spurring a surprise cut to one of its key lending rates in late June.""The equity rally over the past two months implies macroeconomic scenarios that are even more positive than a soft landing. We maintain that this market action is largely a result of mechanical re-risking,"" Kolanovic went on to warn.Other pros suggest investors should be developing contingency plans such as rotating out of momentum tech trades and into relatively safer dividend-payers.""Whenever the stock market reaches today’s valuation levels, 'price' always falls to resolve the divergence. Therefore, investors should develop contingency strategies now … even if the resolution to today’s divergence doesn’t take place for a while,"" notes Miller Tabak chief markets strategist Matt Maley.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in periods of economic downturns, and go directly to read 5 Best Recession Dividend Stocks to Buy. As the stock market bounced back from last year's lows, analysts have differing opinions on the likelihood of a recession happening this year. Bloomberg's July survey of economists revealed higher projections for gross domestic product in the second and third quarters. However, despite the improved outlook, forecasters still believe there is a 60% chance of the US entering a recession within the next year. On the other hand, according to Goldman Sachs, the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 25%, down from the previous projection of 35% made shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March. The report also mentioned that growth in the U.S. is receiving a significant boost from the recovery in real disposable income and stabilization in the housing market.Despite many investors anticipating a recession for a while, the labor market and consumer spending have shown resilience, indicating that a recession may not be imminent. However, investors must be prepared for any potential downturn, as predicting recessions is challenging and uncertain. Investors are advised to focus on prudent industries that are known for their resilience and stability. For example, healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities are some sectors that tend to be less sensitive to economic fluctuations, making them potentially safer options for weathering the storm of a recession. Business Insider also published a report that revealed that the consumer staples industry outperformed the market by 49% in 25 years ending 2015, with most of this outperformance occurring during recessionary periods.  Similarly, the Dow Jones Utility Average was down just 1.4% in 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowDividends are one of the reasons why these industries perform better than others during a recession. The nature of their businesses, which provide essential goods and services, often results in relatively predictable cash flows and revenue streams. This stability allows them to maintain their dividend policies with more confidence, even during economic downturns.Though dividend stocks are not immune to recession, these companies often demonstrate more stability than high-growth or speculative stocks during periods of economic downturn. The performance of dividend stocks in 2022 underscores their significance in any investment portfolio. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats proved to be a reliable defensive strategy last year, especially given that the overall S&amp;P 500 had its worst performance since the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. While the Dividend Aristocrats index also ended the year with losses, it fared much better compared to the broader market. So, even though it wasn't entirely immune to the downturn, it provided a more resilient investment option during a challenging period. Some of the best dividend stocks to consider during a recession include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). In addition to these, we have compiled a list of dividend stocks to buy in case of a recession.11 Best Recession Dividend Stocks to BuyPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this article, we used Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and identified dividend stocks from industries that are known to be recession-proof, such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities.

Finally, we shortlisted 11 dividend stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors tracked by Insider Monkey as of Q1 2023.11. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 Dividend Yield as of July 24: 7.45%Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a Texas-based midstream natural gas and crude oil pipeline company that is involved in the transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas, refined products, and petrochemicals.On July 10, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) declared a 2% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. This marked the company's 24th consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on July 24 came in at 7.45%. In addition to EPD, other dividend stocks to consider for a recession include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

461,e65d3ec9-8c74-3df7-ac89-9a7d9be81042,PEP,2023-07-25,PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders have earned a 14% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-nasdaq-pep-shareholders-earned-140036226.html,1690207236,STORY,['PEP'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the PepsiCo share price has climbed 67% in five years, easily topping the market return of 53% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 15% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, PepsiCo achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 11% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on PepsiCo's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of PepsiCo, it has a TSR of 92% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePepsiCo shareholders have received returns of 15% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 14% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PepsiCo better, we need to consider many other factors.

Its revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to have increased on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Our estimate for the same is $3.78 billion.Estimates &amp; Key Factors to Note for Q2The Zacks Consensus Estimate for management and financial advice fees (constituting more than 60% of the company’s total net revenues) is pegged at $2.28 billion, which suggests a marginal rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM and AUA is pegged at $1.26 trillion, indicating an increase of 8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $1.25 trillion.While Ameriprise’s initiatives to focus on cost management have resulted in controlled general and administration expenses in the past, overall costs are anticipated to have been elevated in the to-be-reported quarter due to costs related to technology upgrades. Our estimate for total expenses is pegged at $3.41 billion, indicating a rise of 33.5% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Ameriprise beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Cisco Systems’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Cisco Systems seems to be fairly priced at around 16% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Cisco Systems today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $63.35, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, Cisco Systems’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from Cisco Systems?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Cisco Systems' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 23%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CSCO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CSCO, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Cisco Systems mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.
