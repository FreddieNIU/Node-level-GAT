When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent sale by Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab was not their only sale of Charles Schwab shares this year. Earlier in the year, they fetched US$69.43 per share in a -US$19m sale. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$81.61). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.2%of Charles Schwab's holding.In total, Charles Schwab insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Charles Schwab Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. In total, insiders sold US$48m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Charles SchwabAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Charles Schwab insiders own about US$9.7b worth of shares (which is 6.4% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Charles Schwab Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, Charles Schwab makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Charles Schwab.

1,c6d80bad-1e82-3296-9e42-14749ff7f377,SCHW,2022-11-26,Why Is Evercore (EVR) Up 11.8% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-evercore-evr-11-8-163104698.html,1669393864,STORY,"['EVR', 'SCHW']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Evercore (EVR). Shares have added about 11.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Evercore due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Evercore Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesEvercore reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 in third-quarter 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35. However, the bottom line was 44% down from the prior-year quarter.While the decline in the net revenues of the Investment Banking and Investment Management segments affected the overall top line, a decline in expenses alleviated the bottom-line pressure. Amid a challenging environment, the company saw a decline in AUM.On a GAAP basis, net income available to common shareholders was $82.4 million or $2.03 per share, down from $159.5 million or $3.74 per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Decline, Expenses FallNet revenues decreased 30% year over year to $576.9 million in the reported quarter. Nonetheless, the top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $462 million. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in all revenue components other than commissions and related revenues.Total expenses decreased 22.8% to $446.5 million from the prior-year quarter.The adjusted compensation ratio was 61%, up from the prior-year period’s 58.5%.The adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, down from the prior-year quarter’s 31.5%.Quarterly Segmental PerformanceInvestment Banking: Net revenues declined 30.5% year over year to $560.5 million. Operating income decreased 49.4% to $126.9 million.Investment Management: Net revenues were $16.4 million, down 1.3% from the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $3.48 million against an operating loss of $5.48 million from the year-ago quarter’s tally. AUM was $9.98 billion as of the third-quarter end, down 12% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesBalance Sheet PositionAs of Sep 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $473.1 million, and investment securities and certificates of deposit were $1.3 billion. Current assets exceeded current liabilities by $1.5 billion as of the same date.Capital Deployment ActivitiesIn the third quarter of 2022, 0.3 million shares were repurchased by the company at an average price of $98.71 per share.Further, Evercore returned capital worth $565.3 million to its shareholders in the first nine months of 2022 through dividends and repurchases of 3.9 million shares at an average price of $118.28 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.1% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Evercore has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Evercore has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerEvercore belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Another stock from the same industry, The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW), has gained 5.3% over the past month.

They have the potential for long-term, steady growth that can pad your wallet with extra income for years to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHave Investors’ Losses Deposited in YOUR AccountLittle-known system uses investor mistakes to give YOU the chance to pocket much as an extra $30,000 annually in instant CASH income…Learn More HereNo. 1: The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)Did you know your broker makes money from you in more ways than commissions? They aren’t always so forthcoming about the revenues they extract from you, but in most cases, these revenue streams are tied to interest rates.As rates rise, it positively affects net margins, driving profits higher. Payment for order flow, margin interest, and share lending are examples of how brokerages like Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) can stay in business despite charging no commissions.For example, if you have a margin account, your broker can “borrow” your shares and lend them to short-sellers. They don’t pay you anything for that access, but they charge interest on the margin used by the short-seller to hold their position. The higher rates rise, the larger the margin is for brokers.While all those income strategies are bad for a broker’s customers, they are good for a broker’s shareholders. In that sector, we like Schwab, which we know looks like a bit of a dog right now, but that is normal for bear markets.If interest rates remain high and market conditions stabilize (or, dare we hope, improve…?), then SCHW should see a big move higher. Schwab has been acquiring customers through acquisitions, which gives them the scale to amplify their profits once, the market starts to settle and trading balances rise again.Story continuesNo. 2: Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)Retail services stocks aren’t immune from inflation problems, but some companies have strategies to deal with it.For example, Starbucks frequently deals with inflation-deflation cycles in their raw materials (coffee beans). From the bottom of the pandemic bear market to the top at the end of 2021, coffee prices rose 100%, while SBUX shares rallied 89%.General inflation is more complicated for SBUX to deal with than just rising coffee prices. Still, the point is that the firm is already good at adjusting to maintain price stability. That’s why we expect SBUX to stay off its lows and rally in the short-term while consumer spending remains strong.No. 3: Waste Management Inc. (WM)It usually makes sense in a volatile market to focus on defensive, dividend-paying stocks. That is still true now, but because interest rates and inflation are rising, traditional dividend strategies don’t work as well. Future dividends are worth less when interest rates rise because the present value of those income streams is lower.However, if a company has a defensible near-monopoly on their customer base, positive margin trends, and historically has raised its dividend above inflation rates, then the old rules can still apply in an inflationary market. Waste Management is precisely that kind of company.WM’s efforts to harvest energy and byproducts from trash collection and landfills are just two examples of how the company is working to increase cash flows to keep its dividend payout ratio high and the yield ahead of inflation. As the pool of dividend stocks shrinks, we expect value investors to flow into the company’s shares in the short term.Bottom LineThis time of year is a whirlwind, and the downtime we can scrounge is often dedicated to reflection.It’s been a tough year, but we believe these three stocks we’ve showed you today have the ability to make you good, solid money in 2023 – and beyond.But that’s not where the potential ends.By now, I hope you’ve heard: Our team has just announced our 113th winning trade this year… giving us a VERIFIED +93.39% winning track record in 2022.This winning percentage is something you can’t fake.Thing is, this doesn’t happen with regular stock picking.

Further, softness in the personal electronics and industrial end-markets remains an overhang.However, the continued rebound in the automotive market was a tailwind.

Shares have added about 4.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Antero Resources due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Antero’s Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues BeatAnteroreported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.63 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.91.  However, the bottom line significantly improved from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 19 cents.Total quarterly revenues of $2,065 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,982 million. The top line increased from the year-ago quarter’s $534 million.Lower-than-expected quarterly earnings can be attributed to a fall in natural gas-equivalent production volumes. The negatives were offset by higher realizations of commodity prices.Stock BuybackAntero Resources has authorization from the board of directors to increase its share repurchase program by $1 billion to $2 billion, reflecting strong initiatives of returning capital to shareholders.Overall ProductionTotal production through the September quarter was 294 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), which declined 2% from 299 Bcfe a year ago.

5,adad7017-07e6-3855-babe-ac9cf1f1149d,UNM,2022-11-26,4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Scoop Up for Optimum Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-price-cash-flow-123612190.html,1669379772,STORY,"['UNM', 'AER', 'GIII']","[Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group UNM, AerCap Holdings N.V. AER, G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL  boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio.

(NYSE:TMO) insiders disposed of US$4.7m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-thermo-fisher-120040357.html,1669464040,STORY,['TMO'],"[The fact that multiple Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher ScientificIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$542 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$551, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 28% of Michel Lagarde's holding.Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$335m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher Scientific Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Thermo Fisher Scientific and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

We are publishing this article today because it’s always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called “smart money” is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong.In this article you will see the top 10 stock picks of Alexander West's Blue Pool Capital as of the third quarter of last year.To assess the performance of these stocks and the hedge fund, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months through November 25.At the time of writing we had mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks from famous Wall Street analysts. It’d be interesting for our readers to see how right or wrong were these analysts’ price targets and calls.However, we should keep the 2022 market crash in mind when reading this article. You will notice that most of the stocks in this list lost value over the past 12 months. That doesn’t, however, mean that the hedge fund was entirely wrong. The fund believes in holding stocks for longer periods of time. These holdings might end up creating profits for the hedge fund in the months and years to come as analysts believe the market could rebound strongly in 2023 and beyond.Alexander West is the founder, managing partner, and chief investment officer of Blue Pool Capital, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund with a portfolio worth $1.39 billion as of Q3 2021. Blue Pool Capital invests mainly in the healthcare, information technology, finance, consumer discretionary, and communications sectors. Story continuesAlexander West graduated from the Stockholm School of Economics in 1990.

(NYSE:TMO) is a Massachusetts-based company offering laboratory equipment, scientific instrumentation, reagents and consumables, and software solutions.

(NYSE:TMO) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Two additional names in the health care sector in the quarter, partially funded with a sale, made strong contributions and helped push our relative exposure to the sector from underweight to overweight. We added Thermo Fisher Scientific to increase our exposure to health care tools, which has been an attractive and core segment within health care. Thermo Fisher’s instruments are used to monitor and protect air, water, and food quality, and the company has strong long-term fundamentals, a top-tier management team and a diversified business.”9. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)Blue Pool Capital’s Stake Value: $23,834,000Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -7.9%Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), a Connecticut-based travel technology company, is one of the best stocks to buy according to Alexander West's Blue Pool Capital.

(NASDAQ:BKNG) by 32% in the third quarter, holding 10,040 shares of the company, worth $23.8 million, representing 1.71% of the firm’s total Q3 securities. Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni on January 7 assumed coverage of Booking Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We reinvested the proceeds from our successful investment in Thermo Fisher in Booking Holdings (Booking). Booking was an investment in the Fund at Inception and was featured in our inaugural June 2019 Quarterly Report. The company owns the world’s largest online travel agent (OTA), Booking.com. To say the past 2.5 years has been volatile for Booking is a major understatement. Booking’s management has had to address the COVID-19-driven collapse in demand for travel accommodation, as well as to manage volatile demand as the world gradually recovers, interrupted by second and third waves of COVID-19 as variants arise.Throughout these volatile market conditions, Booking’s management has executed against a consistent strategy, investing in its platform and network of accommodation providers, and expanding its associated services while improving efficiencies. We believe Booking will come out of the COVID-19 environment a stronger business, with less competition and consumers more predisposed to booking their travel accommodation online. Travel is recovering strongly as vaccination rates increase and COVID-19 related restrictions are lifted, and we expect Booking’s earnings and cash flow to also recover strongly over the coming years.”8.

NVIDIA, the leading chip designer well known for its graphic processing units and its complementary CUDA software ecosystem, is at the forefront of the effort to provide the analytical platform needed to unlock the full potential of such specialist processors.”7.

We initiated our position during the 2020 Presidential election at a time of heightened political and regulatory uncertainty.We believe under its new CEO, Andrew Witty, UnitedHealth can not only preserve its market dominance and sustain industry-leading growth rates across most of its key segments but also enter new healthcare services markets. Witty is known as a mission-driven CEO who clearly articulates his view that providing high-quality, affordable health care services is a social good. He receives consistently high marks from former colleagues, and we believe that his leadership approach will ballast and even strengthen UNH’s already impressive management and employee ranks. The insurance and services businesses are synergistic and complementary, which entrenches United’s critical role in care financing, access, and management. This dynamic gives us confidence in the durability of United’s market leadership…” (Click here to see the full text)6. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)Blue Pool Capital’s Stake Value: $37,736,000Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -66%Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:FB)’s spending on the Metaverse over the next several years and how rapidly the spending at Facebook Reality Labs will increase from the $10 billion already spent in 2021. Here is what Canterbury Tollgate has to say about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“To say traditional media is anti-Facebook would not be an overstatement. An already intense and multi-year critique of (or attack on) Facebook has ratcheted up in recent weeks. Facebook’s research efforts have been reported on, if often derided, for nearly a decade. Going back to 2014, Slate.com called their research practices “unethical” when FB tried to study the impact social posts had on users. Now those efforts have been turned against them for the kill shot.My job is to observe, assess, and allocate. Not to commentate on all the whims and wishes of media narrative. However, in the case of Facebook I cannot avoid going into some detail re: the onslaught against them, which I find to be most unwarranted and insincere.Last month the Wall Street Journal ran a five-piece series titled “The Facebook Files” which allegedly shows how toxic Instagram is for teens. The foundation of their argument was a single slide from an internal presentation claiming, based on FB’s own research, that of teens who had a negative self-image, one-third said Instagram “made them feel worse.”iii Somehow the implication here is that this is not an inescapable aspect of either the human psyche and/or society-at large, but that it is of Facebook’s doing…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see Was Alexander West's Blue Pool Capital Right About These 5 Stocks?   Suggested articles:11 Best Bitcoin Stocks To BuyGoldman Sachs Dividend Stocks10 Undervalued European Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

Based on store checks, Cowen estimated Black Friday retail traffic could increase 7 to 9 percent, which would be “slightly above” the 3 percent month-to-date trends in November.“Following Black Friday, we note retailers could likely benefit from the extra Saturday between Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Chen added.“I’ve been doing my rounds around Atlanta. It seems the parking lots are full. It takes 20 or 30 minutes to find a spot, ” said Murali Gokki, managing director in the retail practice of Alix Partners consulting firm, who visited Phipps Plaza and Perimeter Mall shopping centers.“The malls are lively, but there are very few people walking around with shopping bags despite sales of 30 to 60 percent,” observed Gokki. “The sales are much more broad in terms of offerings. There appears to be many storewide sales.”He said that Sephora and Bath &amp; Body Works were the busiest stores, while many others were not quite as busy.“Many folks are together in family groups or together with friends and appear to be having a good time, but they also appear to be very targeted in terms of what they want to buy,” Gokki said. “One of our recent surveys points to many folks reporting they are browsing and searching online with intent to go to the store for a purchase. The crowds are hovering at certain stores, where they probably already knew what they were going to purchase.”Story continues“Honestly, it looked like a normal shopping day to me. I had trouble discerning anything notable,” said Brian Ehrig, partner in the consumer practice at Kearney, the strategy and management consulting firm, who at 10 a.m. in Nashville, Tennessee, went shopping at the One Hundred Oaks mall housing offpricers including Ross, Burlington and TJMaxx, among other value-oriented stores. “To my surprise, the parking lot was half empty. Perhaps I got there after the real early crowd. But I also went to a Walmart in Nashville. It was the same story…Black Friday is not the traffic driver it once was,” said Ehrig, adding that the holiday season this year really began six weeks ago, with many retailers launching their holiday deals.This fall there has been a chorus of retailers citing “normalized” shopping patterns, meaning Americans are increasingly returning in greater frequency to brick and mortar stores while spending less online than they did during the pandemic. Yet there’s also a sense that consumers are holding back on buying gifts, anticipating bigger markdowns closer to Christmas, and realizing they have an extra Saturday to shop this year, with Christmas Day falling on a Sunday.“The holiday time frame is a long haul,” said Gennette. “It’s just too early to call which way the customer is shopping, but the team is ready,” having inventories under control and equipped with new pricing technology that can manage markdowns more effectively.No one is expecting Black Friday or Cyber Week to be the blockbusters they were in past years, though Gennette did say he would expect some up tempo in purchasing for those periods, followed by a lull in shopping. “Then we come back stronger for the last ten days before the holiday.”Gennette said that Black Friday promotions, which have been going on since last Sunday, continue through Saturday. On Sunday, Macy’s triggers Cyber Monday specials and then a friends and family event starts Tuesday.The weather was conducive for shopping on Friday in most of the country, with a little rain on the East Coast in the morning, northern temperatures in the 50s, and heavier rain in Texas and other areas along the Gulf Coast. Weather conditions on Saturday are predicted as mostly clear, cooler, though rain Sunday could be heavy.Macy’s best sellers for Black Friday included women’s cashmere sweaters reduced to $39.99; diamond studs at 60 percent off; Samsonite luggage at 60 to 65 percent off, and small kitchen appliances at 20 to 50 percent off. Popular toy and game brands were Pokemon, Barbie, Geoffrey the Giraffe and Lego as well as Sharper Image drones.Other best sellers were cosmetics gift sets, fragrances; boots, and quilted outerwear.According to the National Retail Federation, 166.3 million people in the U.S., almost eight million more than last year, are expected to shop from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday. Holiday sales during November and December are forecast to grow between 6 and 8 percent over 2021, compared to the 13.5 percent last year, though some of the results may be skewed as deals and promotions continue to be pulled forward.A survey by the ICSC found that shoppers expect to spend a total of $125 billion, a 10 percent increase over 2021, in the days between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday. “Inflation and rising interest rates are still a concern, as 89 percent of consumers plan to shop for Thanksgiving Weekend’s deals and promotions. As consumers remain cognizant of economic factors affecting their wallets, 81 percent say that rising interest rates are likely to impact their shopping behaviors or payment methods throughout the holiday weekend.” The ICSC also found that 37 percent of U.S. consumers plan to cut back on their overall spending for holiday.“Our top Black Friday holiday stocks are Macy’s Walmart and Ulta,” Cowen indicated. “Each will benefit from product diversification, trend right execution, gifting assortments at competitive prices, and value positioning. At Macy’s we like an expanding toy selection with the Toys R Us partnership and the selection of key gifting categories including outerwear, knits, and beauty. We expect Walmart to continue to benefit from the trade down at the high end, increasing penetration of Walmart+ members, competitive prices, and momentum in grocery and essentials. We believe Ulta will benefit from strong demand for beauty, and creative Black Friday deals should drive engagement with its (approximate) 38 million loyalty members…Bath &amp; Body Works BBWI is another top pick given the company’s compelling value proposition and leadership in the self-care category.”]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best COVID Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. In May 2022, the United States exceeded one million deaths from COVID-19. Healthcare experts believe that the virus is here to stay for the foreseeable future, and the new normal will vary for every individual. As of June 30, 2022, there have been more than 87 million reported cases of COVID-19 in the United States, and despite the large variety of vaccines, booster shots, and antibody drugs available in the market, many Americans refuse to inoculate themselves against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the COVID-19 virus is now less lethal than it was in 2020, it is widespread, and Europe and the United States have reached the endemic stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as per McKinsey. The winter of 2022 and 2023 may see a more increase in reported COVID patients in the Northern Hemisphere, yet it won’t be as significant as the December 2021–February 2022 wave.As the risk of the pandemic has not completely died down, investors might still benefit from the leading companies which made record-breaking sales during COVID-induced lockdowns.Our Methodology For this article we scanned the database Insider Monkey tracking 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 11 stocks that benefited greatly from the pandemic and are still positioned to profit from any possible pandemic situation in the future. Some of these companies are working on COVID treatments and vaccines while others see a huge demand of their products and services during lockdowns caused by COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemics.Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashBest COVID Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational company that discovers, manufactures, and sells healthcare products worldwide. It operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)’s Q1 2022 profits exceeded $2.4 billion given a rise in sales of COVID-19 diagnostic tests as the Omicron variant spread earlier this year. Revenues from diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have been a meaningful profit and sales boost to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) since 2020 and this pattern has continued into 2022. It is one of the best COVID stocks to invest in. Story continuesOn October 19, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.15 and a revenue of $10.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.21 and $750 million, respectively. Full-year 2022 guidance assumes sales from COVID-19 testing of $7.8 billion, including sales of $7.3 billion through September 2022 and forecasted sales of $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter of this year.Mizuho analyst Anthony Petrone on October 26 initiated coverage of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) with a Neutral rating and a $105 price target. The analyst said the Neutral rating balances the advantages of the company's ""solid"" positioning in multiple rapidly advancing medical technology markets and ""fortress"" balance sheet against COVID testing and infant formula recall/relaunch headwinds. He sees this dynamic continuing over the next numerous quarters ""which will now coincide with recession uncertainties.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were long Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the best COVID stocks to monitor. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”10. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is a New York-based company that develops, publishes, and markets interactive entertainment solutions for consumers worldwide. The company offers its products under the Rockstar Games, 2K, Private Division, and T2 Mobile Games brands. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) was one of the biggest beneficiaries from the COVID-19 pandemic, as earnings surged given a gaming boom when people around the world were forced to spend more time at home. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)’s fiscal year 2020 revenue grew 16% to $3.089 billion, as compared to $2.668 billion in fiscal 2019.On November 17, Truist analyst Matthew Thornton maintained a Buy rating on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) but slashed the price target on the shares to $131 from $157. The analyst updated his model after Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)’s softer than anticipated Q3 results, with lower earnings multiple due to its weaker execution. However, the analyst is optimistic about Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) stock in the longer-term, citing its pipeline, deal synergies, deleveraging, and buybacks.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) was part of 63 public stock portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 66 funds in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.80 million shares worth $305.6 million. Here is what Madison Funds specifically said about Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is a leading publisher of video games. Take-Two has a reputation for the high quality of its games, having published industry favorites such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA2K.The video game industry itself has shed much of its boom-and-bust patterns to become a steadier, more predictable business with high barriers to entry, established title franchises, and high levels of recurring, in-game revenue streams. The company has been investing heavily to step up the number of new title launches over the next few years, a favorable set-up which we believe is not fully reflected in its stock price.”9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the biggest American retailers. Walmart Marketplace climbed to an estimated 70,000 sellers in 2020, driven by a rise in online shopping due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Walmart and Amazon together earned an additional $10.7 billion in profits as compared to 2019, representing a 56% year-over-year increase. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the best COVID stocks to monitor. On November 15, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.50 and a revenue of $152.8 billion, topping analysts’ estimates by $0.18 and $6 billion, respectively. Sales increased year-over-year in all Walmart divisions, and the global advertising business grew over 30%, driven by strength at Walmart Connect in the US and Flipkart Ads. Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman on November 17 raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $164 from $150 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares, citing higher estimates following the company's Q3 ""beat &amp; raise"" and rolling forward his valuation framework to FY25 estimates.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 68 funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of September 2022, compared to 67 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent position holder in the company, with 4 million shares worth $522.6 million. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco has been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”8. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the best COVID stocks to monitor. The American retailer’s revenues were $167 billion in the year to August 2020, up nearly 10% year-over-year. Online sales in 2020 rose by 50%, supported by purchases during the pandemic. Online sales more than doubled in both May and August in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The pandemic fueled record sales and profits, and Costco was able to cater to its 113 million members efficiently. In October 2022, Costco’s net sales increased 7.7% year-over-year to $17.73 billion.On November 22, BofA analysts added Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to the firm's ""US 1 List,"" which represents a collection of the best investment ideas from the universe of Buy-rated American stocks covered by BofA’s fundamental equity research analysts.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was part of 69 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 64 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw held a notable stake in the company, comprising 1.10 million shares worth $521.7 million. Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”7. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an American company that discovers, develops, and markets human pharmaceuticals worldwide. In February 2022, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s COVID-19 antibody drug for people aged 12 and older at risk of extreme illness. This drug has been found to work effectively against the highly contagious Omicron variant. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is one of the premier COVID stocks backed by hedge funds. On November 22, Berenberg analyst Kerry Holford raised the price target on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to $375 from $345 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Despite forex headwinds, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s ""underlying performance remains strong,"" the analyst wrote in a research note. The analyst said early signs from the Mounjaro diabetes launch are positive and a label expansion to include an obesity drug is now anticipated before the conclusion of next year.According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), compared to 70 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital held a prominent stake in the company, with approximately 2.5 million shares worth $802.8 million. Here is what ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy has to say about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company. It is one of the best COVID stocks to monitor. After interim results of a trial that demonstrated 89% efficacy for Pfizer’s COVID-19 pill, Louise Chen of Cantor Fitzgerald said she forecasts Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)’s COVID-19 vaccine sales to be $25 billion in 2027, a meaningful boost on her prior estimate of $10 billion. On November 17, Credit Suisse analyst Trung Huynh initiated coverage of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) with an Outperform rating and a $55 price target. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has been ""impacted adversely"" after its COVID vaccine success, but the analyst’s Outperform rating is not based on a single asset. He sees pipeline advances supporting future growth at the company.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 77 hedge funds were bullish on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) at the end of September 2022, up from 70 funds in the last quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the leading stake in the company, comprising 3.90 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is one of the top COVID stocks on the radar of smart investors. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best COVID Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:12 Best Asian Stocks To Buy25 Highest Yielding Monthly Dividend Stocks10 Biggest Electrical Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 11 Best COVID Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

In 2021, FBHS’s cost of sales increased 25% year over year despite its cost-reduction initiatives. In the first nine months of 2022, cost of sales climbed 7.1% year over year. Rising cost of sales poses a threat to FBHS’ bottom line. Despite focusing on supply-chain optimization, FBHS is facing constraints on that front and labor shortage.Slowdown in the US new construction activity due to inflation and rising interest rates is weighing on Fortune Brands’ operations. Due to this headwind and channel-inventory reductions, FBHS lowered its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts.

Adjusted earnings are estimated to be $6.20-$6.30 per share in 2022 compared with $6.36-$6.50 predicted earlier.Persistent weakness in the Water Innovations segment due to inventory destocking and COVID-related shutdowns in China is also weighing on Fortune Brands’ shares. Net sales from the segment declined 14% year over year in the third quarter. For 2022, FBHS expects net sales to decrease 5-6% from the year-ago reading.Foreign currency headwinds are denting Fortune Brands’ revenues. FBHS has a significant operational presence for its Water Innovations and Cabinet segments in Canada. This exposes the company to forex woes. In the third quarter, foreign exchange issues hurt Water Innovations’ net sales by 1%. A stronger U.S. dollar might depress the company's overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksFortune Brands carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Retail-Wholesale sector are as follows:Ethan Allen Interiors ETD sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), at present.

(RJF) Up 5.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-financial-inc-rjf-163104164.html,1669393864,STORY,"['RJF', 'RJF-PB', 'MS']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF). Shares have added about 5.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Raymond James Financial, Inc. due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Raymond James Q4 Earnings Top Estimates on Solid NII RiseRaymond James’ fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30) adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00. The bottom line was, however, down 2% from the prior-year quarter.Higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand acted as tailwinds, which led to a solid rise in net interest income. The performance of the Private Client Group was impressive. Also, the acquisitions over the past years supported the company’s financials to some extent.Yet, a rise in expenses and poor investment banking performance due to heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic ambiguities were the undermining factors. Also, RJF recorded bank loan provision for credit losses during the quarter, which indicates “a weaker macroeconomic outlook.”Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $437 million, up 2% year over year.In fiscal 2022, adjusted earnings per share of $7.49 beat the consensus estimate of $7.37 and grew 3% year over year. Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.51 billion, increasing 7%.Revenues &amp; Costs IncreaseNet revenues were $2.83 billion, increasing 5% year over year. The rise was mainly driven by higher NII and account and service fees. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.73 billion.In fiscal 2022, net revenues rose 13% to $11 billion. The top line outpaced the consensus estimate of $10.90 billion.Segment-wise, in the reported quarter, the Bank segment registered a surge of 143% from the prior year in net revenues. This was driven by higher interest rates and the inclusion of TriState Capital for a full quarter. Also, Private Client Group recorded an 11% growth in net revenues. Capital Markets’ top line declined 28%, while Asset Management’s net revenues fell 9%. Others recorded negative revenues of $207 million compared with negative revenues of $72 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses were up 4% to $2.22 billion. The rise was mainly due to an increase in all cost components except Compensation, commissions and benefits expenses and investment sub-advisory fees. Also, RJF recorded a bank loan provision for credit losses of $34 million compared with $5 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Sep 30, 2022, client assets under administration were $1.09 trillion, down 7% from the end of the prior-year quarter. Financial assets under management were $173.8 billion, down 9%.Story continuesStrong Balance Sheet &amp; Capital RatiosAs of Sep 30, 2022, Raymond James reported total assets of $81 billion, down 6% from the prior quarter. Total equity fell 1% sequentially to $9.3 billion.Book value per share was $43.41, up from $40.08 as of Sep 30, 2021.As of Sep 30, 2022, total capital ratio was 20.5% compared with 26.2% as of Sep 30, 2021. Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.2% compared with 25% as of September 2021-end.Return on common equity (annualized basis) was 18.7% at the end of the reported quarter compared with 21.3% a year ago.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, RJF repurchased 0.6 million shares for $62 million.OutlookThe PCG segment results for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 are expected to get adversely impacted by the expected 4% sequential decline in asset management and related administrative fees.In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, asset management and related administrative fees are expected to decline 4% sequentially.The average quarterly IB revenues in fiscal 2023 will be similar to what was experienced over the last two quarters. However, a lot of variables can impact the estimate but that is expected to result in a 20% decline in IB revenues in fiscal 2023.In the Asset Management segment, results are expected to be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management.Net interest margin and average yield from third-party banks are expected to keep increasing with the anticipated rate hikes.Given a 75-basis-point rate increase in November and some assumptions around deposit beta and other variables, the company expects the average yield on RJBDP from third-party banks for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 to be 2.5% and the bank segment’s NIM to average 3.15%.In fiscal 2023, non-compensation expenses are expected to be $1.7 billion, of which $410 million base represents some 1.5% growth sequentially each quarter in 2023.Driven by the company’s current revenue mix, forward rate curve over the next 12 months, the impact of the TriState deal and the successful implementation of the expense initiative, the company targets a compensation ratio of less than 66%, going forward.The company expects to repurchase shares worth $250 million per quarter for fiscal 2023 or $1 billion for the fiscal year.An adjusted pre-tax margin of 19-20% is expected amid the higher interest rate environment.The effective tax rate is expected to be 24-25%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Raymond James Financial, Inc. has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Raymond James Financial, Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerRaymond James Financial, Inc. belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Another stock from the same industry, Morgan Stanley (MS), has gained 11.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Morgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.44 per share, indicating a change of -30.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.

24,7687bb09-f483-37c4-8f75-35ca0e94c83c,MGM,2022-11-26,7 Best Hotel Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-hotel-stocks-buy-213048296.html,1669148448,STORY,"['CHH', 'MGM', 'IHG', 'MAR']","[The central thesis for buying hotel stocks right now is a belief that demand for travel will continue. And if that’s true, then the best hotel stocks will offer investors a combination of value and growth.Lost amid the ongoing concerns about flight delays is that Americans continue to travel. After two summers when travel was either non-existent or severely curtailed, Americans are taking long-planned vacations. And that’s good news for the hotel industry, which has been battered in the last two years.From personal experience, I can see that hotels are busier than they were during the pandemic. However, data from STR shows occupancy is still slightly below pre-pandemic levels. On the other hand, the same research shows revenue per available room and average daily rates are both higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are the seven best hotel stocks to buy now:Best Hotel Stocks: Marriott International (MAR)Marriott logo in Milan, Italy. MAR stock.Source: DELBO ANDREA / ShutterstockThe first on our list of best hotel stocks is Marriott International (NYSE:MAR), the parent company for some of the industry’s most iconic premium hotel brands. Marriot is also home to one of the largest loyalty programs, which currently has over 140 million members.The global pandemic didn’t do much to curtail the company’s expansion plans, particularly as it relates to international markets. The company expects to see revenue per available room grow between 2% and 4% in 2022 compared to 2019. This may be starting to show up in the company’s revenue, which hit $4.2 billion in the second quarter. That was just shy of pre-pandemic levels and the earnings picture is improving, as well.MAR stock has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.5 times. If revenue and earnings grow as expected, Marriott stock looks like a solid buy.Choice Hotels International (CHH)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Choice Hotels (CHH) website.Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.comIf Marriott represents the luxury end of the market, Choice Hotels International (NYSE:CHH) falls into the “something for everybody” category. The hotel chain features several brands that target various income levels.Story continuesWhile some might see that as a “jack of all trades” positioning, it appears to be working. In the last couple of quarters, when prior-year comparisons have been more difficult, both revenue and earnings have beaten pre-pandemic levels. Choice Hotels is also benefiting from the growth in extended-stay revenue due to the blending of business and leisure travel.As of this writing, Choice Hotels has a P/E ratio of 20 times, which is slightly above the sector average, but not incredibly overvalued. Projections for future growth and earnings are above pre-pandemic levels. The company also generated a record amount of free cash flow in 2021. Plus, after institutions sold more CHH stock than they bought in the fourth quarter, that changed dramatically in the first quarter.Best Hotel Stocks: InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG)InterContinental Hotels (IHG) sign on a hotelSource: Cineberg/Shutterstock.comAnother of the best hotel stocks to consider is InterContinental Hotel Group (NYSE:IHG). Like many hotel chains, the U.K.-based company is showing strong year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth. But when it comes to hotels, a fairer comparison is to 2019. On that measure, IHG’s revenue is still lagging behind.A big reason for that is the company has larger exposure to business and international travel than some other hotel chains. And looking out over five years, revenue is not expected to get back to pre-pandemic levels.However, what makes the hotel chain compelling is its ability to expand. In 2021, the hotel chain added more than 400 hotels into its portfolio. That’s one reason why earnings are expected to get back to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.IHG has a about the same P/E ratio as Marriott. It also has a price target that suggests an upside of nearly 20%. That means IHG stock is likely slightly undervalued, even if analysts lower their price targets.MGM (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM International (NYSE:MGM) suffered from a double whammy during the pandemic. As a company that has exposure to both casinos and hotels, MGM experienced a dramatic loss in revenue during the lockdown.But what was a negative during the pandemic is now giving the company the opportunity to rapidly grow as casinos become a destination for the revenge travel that’s sweeping the country. And in their most recent earnings report, MGM is posting revenue and earnings that are above pre-pandemic levels.MGM also has exposure to the casino industry in Macau, which is starting to come back as China begins to ease its Covid-19 lockdowns. Plus, MGM also has its own sportsbook, BetMGM. As I pointed out in March, revenue from the sportsbook jumped 500% YOY in 2021.Best Hotel Stocks: Bluegreen Vacations (BVH)Couple signing timeshare agreement with realtor.Source: antoniodiaz / ShutterstockWill the pandemic cause Americans to rethink time shares? That’s the argument for investing in Bluegreen Vacation (NYSE:BVH). The company markets and sells vacation ownership and manages resorts in some of the most popular destinations in the United States. The primary source of revenue for the company is the Bluegreen Vacation Club.Like many companies in this sector, Bluegreen Vacations suffered a sharp drop in revenue during the pandemic. However, the company did manage to cut costs, which led to free cash flow of over $63 million, its highest level since 2014.Additionally, BVH stock trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 6.28 times. The company’s forward price target shows an upside of more than 125%. That may be coming down, but even if it’s cut in half, investors will still get a nice reward for owning the stock.Hersha Hospitality Trust (HT)a businessperson holds an imaginary blueprint of a houseSource: ShutterstockNext on this list of best hotel stocks is Hersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE:HT). This is a small real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in “gateway cities” across the United States. This allows the company to capitalize on properties that have a higher revenue per available room. And with many of these cities being among the most popular destinations, the company is likely to post strong revenue and earnings.Additionally, as a REIT, it delivers a significant portion of its earnings back to shareholders in the form of a dividend. The company’s dividend payout ratio is 2.7%. It approximately 67% institutional ownership and buying volume (in terms of dollars invested), which outpaces selling volume by two to one. That suggests now may be a good time for risk-averse investors to invest in HT stock.Best Hotel Stocks: AdvisorShares Hotel ETF (BEDZ)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockTravel exchange-traded funds (ETFs) take away some of the risk that comes with owning individual stocks. And the last of the best hotel stocks on this list is one of the newer ETFs. AdvisorShares Hotel ETF (NYSEARCA:BEDZ) debuted in April 2021. The actively managed ETF gives investors exposure to the global hotel and lodging industry. At the end of 2021, the company had 31 stocks in its holdings. As of this writing, the stock has a market cap of $4.73 million.That being said, the fund is not a pure-play hotel ETF. It also has exposure to the communications, financials and consumer discretionary sectors. The fund also has a relatively high net expense ratio of 0.99%.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”Cash Holders Could Get Hit Hard THIS FRIDAYThe post 7 Best Hotel Stocks to Buy Now appeared first on InvestorPlace.]"

The consequent lockdowns now weighing heavily on global oil demand. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré has the latest. Ines.INES FERRE: Rachelle, and looking at oil right now, we're watching WTI down 1 and 1/2%. Brent crude also lower, as we look at our YFi Interactive board. The oil markets have been weaker in November. You had Brent crude this week that touched its cheapest level since January after that headline that was later refuted by Saudi Arabia about oil production increases, perhaps at the next OPEC Plus meeting.Look, the COVID lockdowns, those are having quite a bit of impact over concerns about demand going forward in China. Also, the Group of Seven headlines coming out of there to cap Russian oil prices. And that cap could be higher than what the market had been expecting, perhaps not having too much of an impact on Russian coffers and being a price that was similar to what Asia pays for Russian oil. We want to also note that you've got the European sanctions that are coming up on December 5, so Brent and WTI futures headed for their-- for a third weekly drop.But what does this all mean for gas prices? Well, we've got the gas price of retail gasoline, the average that AAA has for you, on a full screen, $3.58 a gallon. That's better than the $5-plus that we were seeing in June over the summer of this year. It's still $0.18 higher than a year ago.What does this all mean going into next year? Well, if you take a look at the US Energy Information Administration, that agency's forecast for 2023, they're expecting gasoline prices to hit around $300-- $3-- excuse me-- and $0.60 per gallon in February of 2023. And they're expecting gasoline prices to remain relatively flat in 2023, guys.AKIKO FUJITA: Ines, you mentioned the sanctions over on the EU on oil, specifically Russian oil. But you've also got this big debate that's playing out over a price cap on natural gas, with many of the EU countries simply not on the same page right now. What does that mean in terms of where nat gas is likely to move?Story continuesINES FERRE: Yeah, and if we just take a look at what-- well, this is natural gas here in the US. That's down 4%. But nevertheless, yes, you're right. That has been a debate about capping natural gas prices. And the cap that had been considered before was going to be relatively high to where natural gas prices are right now in Europe.But still, you don't have consensus over that.

36,c44a3b93-a516-3cb8-84d5-593d8e4cda7c,MS,2022-11-26,Morgan Stanley slashes its U.S. housing market outlook—here’s where it sees the home price correction going in 2023,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-slashes-u-housing-211542432.html,1669410942,STORY,['MS'],"[On a national basis, home prices fell 1.3% between June and August. That marked the first decline measured by the lagged Case-Shiller National Home Price Index since 2012.It's more than just a small dip, it's a trajectory shift. At least that's according to the latest forecast produced by the economics team at [hotlink]Morgan Stanley[/hotlink].This year, Morgan Stanley expects U.S. home prices, as measured by the Case-Shiller Index, to finish with a year-over-year increase of 4%. But when considering that the Case-Shiller Index was up 8.9% through the first six months of 2022, that means Morgan Stanley expects U.S. home prices to fall by around 5%—including the 1.3% dip between June and August—in the second half of 2022.The home price correction won't stop there. Morgan Stanley expects U.S. home prices, as measured by the Case-Shiller Index, to fall another 4% in 2023. In total, the Wall Street bank expects home prices to fall around 10% between June 2022 and the bottom in 2024. (Previously, Morgan Stanley had been predicting a 7% peak-to-trough decline in U.S. home prices).The last housing correction, which saw U.S. home prices fall 27% between 2006 and 2012, was anchored by high unemployment, ""pressurized"" affordability, shady mortgage products, and a supply glut. This time around, we just have what Fortune calls ""pressurized"" affordability: Frothy home prices coupled with spiked mortgage rates.""The median price of existing home sales is up 38% since March 2020. Mortgage rates are up over 300 bps [3 percentage points] in the past eight months, the first time we have seen anything like that since 1980/81. The combination of the two has caused affordability to deteriorate faster than at any point in our time series,"" write Morgan Stanley researchers.Heading forward, three levers can help to ""depressurize"" affordability, according to the bank. First, if inflation decelerates and financial conditions loosen, that would in theory push mortgage rates lower and thus improve affordability. Second, rising incomes (which are up 4.4% year-over-year) could improve affordability. Third, home prices continuing to fall would help to ""depressurize"" affordability. As long as affordability remains ""pressurized,"" Morgan Stanley expects that third lever to get pulled.Story continues""Up until this point, we have focused on housing forecasts up until the end of 2023, but we do not believe December 2023 will be the bottom for home prices. It is not a groundbreaking statement to say that the trajectory of home prices into 2024 and beyond is filled with more than a little uncertainty,"" the researchers write.Let's take a deeper look at Morgan Stanley's latest housing outlook.Tight inventory won't stop home prices from falling—but it could create a floorThe ongoing affordability shock—of frothy home prices coupled with spiked mortgage rates—has seen demand crater. On a year-over-year basis, mortgage purchase applications are down 40.7%. However, it hasn't translated into surging supply levels: Inventory levels in October were 37.6% below October 2019 levels.View this interactive chart on Fortune.com""Supply conditions historically argue [for] climbing home prices from here. If we are below 6 months of total supply, annual home price growth has never turned negative within the next six months going back to the beginning of this Case-Shiller Index in the late 1980s. We currently sit at just 3.9 months of supply,"" write Morgan Stanley researchers.But this time could be different: The ongoing affordability strain could see home prices fall even though inventory remains tight. (Here's the Moody's Analytics outlook for the nation's 322 largest markets.)""The fact that we expect home prices to start falling on an annual basis in March 2023 despite tight inventory reflects how unprecedented this affordability situation is in the U.S. housing market,"" writes Morgan Stanley. ""However, although supply doesn't keep home price growth floored at zero, we do believe it prevents home price declines from becoming too large.""Bull case: Home prices stop falling in 2023Peak-to-trough, Morgan Stanley expects U.S. home prices to fall 10% through 2024. However, there's a ""bull"" case where the firm believes U.S. home prices don't fall in 2023 and the peak-to-trough decline comes in around 5%.There's two key pillars to Morgan Stanley's ""bull"" case: Tighter than expected inventory levels and lower than expected mortgage rates.""In a bull case, the lock-in effect keeps inventories at the lows we have experienced in the past year. At the same time, lower mortgage rates incentivize more purchase demand than we are currently expecting as households view any rally as a potentially temporary reprieve and move to take advantage before the next move higher,"" writes Morgan Stanley researchers.In 2023, Morgan Stanley expects 30-year fixed mortgage rates to average 6.2%. However, if the Fed successfully tames inflation sooner than expected, loosened financial conditions could see mortgage rates fall below 6%. Meanwhile, if the so-called lock-in effect (meaning homeowners who don't want to sell and give up their 2% or 3% mortgage rate) continues into 2023, it could make inventory levels tighter than Morgan Stanley currently expects.Bear case: Home prices crash 20%If a ""deep"" recession manifests, Morgan Stanley predicts U.S. home prices could crash 20% from peak-to-trough—including up to an 8% home price decline in 2023 alone.""A common scenario that we are presented with when discussing the bear case for home prices is a longer and deeper recession leading to a material increase in unemployment,"" writes Morgan Stanley researchers. ""What we think would be a more likely cause of a home price bear case would be an intersection of weaker-than-expected demand with a larger increase in inventories than currently forecast.""But even if this ""bear"" scenario were to manifest, Morgan Stanley doesn't think it'd be a full-blown repeat of the 2008 crash.""While this [our bear case] would understandably be negative for the housing market, we continue to believe that the health of credit standards should keep a ceiling on how high true distressed transactions can climb. Additionally, a mortgage servicing industry that is far more practiced in offering borrowers foreclosure alternatives (e.g., modifications) should keep more borrowers in their homes as opposed to forcing a liquidation event,"" writes Morgan Stanley researchers.Want to stay updated on the housing correction?

(RJF). Shares have added about 5.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Raymond James Financial, Inc. due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Raymond James Q4 Earnings Top Estimates on Solid NII RiseRaymond James’ fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30) adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00. The bottom line was, however, down 2% from the prior-year quarter.Higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand acted as tailwinds, which led to a solid rise in net interest income. The performance of the Private Client Group was impressive. Also, the acquisitions over the past years supported the company’s financials to some extent.Yet, a rise in expenses and poor investment banking performance due to heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic ambiguities were the undermining factors. Also, RJF recorded bank loan provision for credit losses during the quarter, which indicates “a weaker macroeconomic outlook.”Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $437 million, up 2% year over year.In fiscal 2022, adjusted earnings per share of $7.49 beat the consensus estimate of $7.37 and grew 3% year over year. Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.51 billion, increasing 7%.Revenues &amp; Costs IncreaseNet revenues were $2.83 billion, increasing 5% year over year. The rise was mainly driven by higher NII and account and service fees. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.73 billion.In fiscal 2022, net revenues rose 13% to $11 billion. The top line outpaced the consensus estimate of $10.90 billion.Segment-wise, in the reported quarter, the Bank segment registered a surge of 143% from the prior year in net revenues. This was driven by higher interest rates and the inclusion of TriState Capital for a full quarter. Also, Private Client Group recorded an 11% growth in net revenues. Capital Markets’ top line declined 28%, while Asset Management’s net revenues fell 9%. Others recorded negative revenues of $207 million compared with negative revenues of $72 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses were up 4% to $2.22 billion. The rise was mainly due to an increase in all cost components except Compensation, commissions and benefits expenses and investment sub-advisory fees. Also, RJF recorded a bank loan provision for credit losses of $34 million compared with $5 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Sep 30, 2022, client assets under administration were $1.09 trillion, down 7% from the end of the prior-year quarter. Financial assets under management were $173.8 billion, down 9%.Story continuesStrong Balance Sheet &amp; Capital RatiosAs of Sep 30, 2022, Raymond James reported total assets of $81 billion, down 6% from the prior quarter. Total equity fell 1% sequentially to $9.3 billion.Book value per share was $43.41, up from $40.08 as of Sep 30, 2021.As of Sep 30, 2022, total capital ratio was 20.5% compared with 26.2% as of Sep 30, 2021. Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.2% compared with 25% as of September 2021-end.Return on common equity (annualized basis) was 18.7% at the end of the reported quarter compared with 21.3% a year ago.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, RJF repurchased 0.6 million shares for $62 million.OutlookThe PCG segment results for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 are expected to get adversely impacted by the expected 4% sequential decline in asset management and related administrative fees.In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, asset management and related administrative fees are expected to decline 4% sequentially.The average quarterly IB revenues in fiscal 2023 will be similar to what was experienced over the last two quarters. However, a lot of variables can impact the estimate but that is expected to result in a 20% decline in IB revenues in fiscal 2023.In the Asset Management segment, results are expected to be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management.Net interest margin and average yield from third-party banks are expected to keep increasing with the anticipated rate hikes.Given a 75-basis-point rate increase in November and some assumptions around deposit beta and other variables, the company expects the average yield on RJBDP from third-party banks for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 to be 2.5% and the bank segment’s NIM to average 3.15%.In fiscal 2023, non-compensation expenses are expected to be $1.7 billion, of which $410 million base represents some 1.5% growth sequentially each quarter in 2023.Driven by the company’s current revenue mix, forward rate curve over the next 12 months, the impact of the TriState deal and the successful implementation of the expense initiative, the company targets a compensation ratio of less than 66%, going forward.The company expects to repurchase shares worth $250 million per quarter for fiscal 2023 or $1 billion for the fiscal year.An adjusted pre-tax margin of 19-20% is expected amid the higher interest rate environment.The effective tax rate is expected to be 24-25%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Raymond James Financial, Inc. has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Raymond James Financial, Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerRaymond James Financial, Inc. belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Another stock from the same industry, Morgan Stanley (MS), has gained 11.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Morgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12%.

Selling at an average price of US$173, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Salesforce Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, for US$53m worth of shares, at about US$182 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$153. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Salesforce insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Salesforce insiders own about US$4.8b worth of shares (which is 3.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Salesforce Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Salesforce, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

The customer relationship management software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.The company’s quarterly performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal third quarter.Salesforce’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes along with increasing business scale with modern technology.Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing &amp; Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.Story continuesHowever, a decline in software spending by small &amp; medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce’s fiscal third-quarter performance.Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds. Also, the increasing investments in international expansions and data centers might have eroded the company’s profitability during the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Salesforce this season.

43,40ede4fa-dd2d-3a60-83a9-ac6582615728,SEE,2022-11-26,There's A Lot To Like About Sealed Air's (NYSE:SEE) Upcoming US$0.20 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-sealed-airs-nyse-120432900.html,1669464272,STORY,['SEE'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Sealed Air investors that purchase the stock on or after the 1st of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.80 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Sealed Air has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current stock price of $52.31. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Sealed Air paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 29% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Sealed Air has grown its earnings rapidly, up 21% a year for the past five years. Sealed Air is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Sealed Air has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.4% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.The Bottom LineIs Sealed Air worth buying for its dividend? Sealed Air has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.While it's tempting to invest in Sealed Air for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Sealed Air you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq have registered a negative return of 15.50%, 5.90% and 27.87%, respectively, so far this year.Domestically, inflation in the United States, which remained the biggest threat to the economy, showed signs of cooling off after the consumer price index recorded a 7.7% increase year over year in October from the pick up of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. Investors are still worried about the high interest rate imposed by the Fed.The Federal Reserve’s ambitious target of 2% is far from met, and market participants are concerned about the high borrowing cost that could cripple the economy and push it toward a recession. Such a situation will undoubtedly impact the business environment and hence stock market returns.At the same time, global issues, especially, the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in global oil and gas scarcity ahead of the chilling winter season, is leaving an indirect impact on the supply-chain disruptions. China’s new COVID-19 breakout is also aggravating volatility in the stock market.Thus, investors seeking regular income in such an unstable situation may invest in dividend-paying stocks. These dividend stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions.Investing in such matured businesses, investors can expect a regular flow of income along withthe preservation of capital against unexpected price changes. It is often seen that a company that tends to reward its investors with a high dividend payout comparatively outperforms non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Farmers National Banc FMNB, Hormel Foods HRL, Bank7 BSVN, BrownForman (BF.B), and Motorola Solutions MSI that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Story continuesFarmers National Banc is a full-service national bank engaged in commercial and retail banking.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Video Game Companies In The World. The video game industry is one of the most popular industries in the world, and one that has improved its product quality exponentially ever since the first consoles came out in the 1970s. Compared to today's high definition, disk-free consoles from Sony and Microsoft, these devices were quite simple with few pixels as their resolutions. These days, gamers even have the choice to fully immerse themselves in the virtual environment, as virtual reality headsets are readily available for both personal computers and consoles.In terms of monetary value, the video game industry is also among the largest in the world. A report from Mordor Intelligence estimates that the sector was worth $198 billion in 2021, and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.94% to sit at $340 billion by the end of 2027. The popularity of the sector is driven partly due to the coronavirus pandemic as well, as populations all over the globe were forced indoors and had to rely on digital mediums for their entertainment. Additionally, the growth in internet usage, particularly in the form of high speed connectivity offered through fifth generation (5G) connectivity, allows more people to access online video games, which are some of the most popular in the world. As an example, Fortnite Mobile, one of the most popular online games in history, had raked in $1 billion in revenue in just two years as of April 2020.Another report, this time from KBV Research, estimates that the global video game industry will grow at a CAGR of 11.8% between 2022 and 2028 and sit at a whopping $413 billion by 2028 end.

That’s an area of particular sensitivity for Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who earlier this year sued to block Meta Platforms Inc. from acquiring a popular fitness app to gain an edge in the fledgling virtual reality market.Although Khan hasn’t commented specifically on the Activision deal, she said at an October conference that the FTC is focusing on ways digital platforms use mergers to maintain their dominance during periods of technical transitions.“Right now we are seeing that period of technological transition -- be it in the context of the cloud or voice assistants or virtual reality,” Khan said. “We have to be especially vigilant across the board, but particularly in the merger context.”Microsoft announced in January it planned to buy game publisher Activision Blizzard, which has developed popular franchises like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. The acquisition would be the company’s largest ever and one of the 30 biggest deals of all time. Although Brazilian antitrust officials cleared it, other competition regulators, including the UK and the European Union, have raised concerns that Microsoft could withhold popular titles from rivals, particularly from Sony Group Corp.’s Playstation.Story continuesMicrosoft said it has offered a proposal that would keep Call of Duty on the Playstation for the next 10 years. But that kind of a settlement might not placate regulators, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie.“This is a deal that needs behavioral concessions and the FTC is not accepting behavioral concessions,” Rie said. “They don’t have any other choice but to sue.”The FTC declined to comment.Microsoft said in a statement it’s “prepared to address the concerns of regulators, including the FTC, and Sony to ensure the deal closes with confidence.” Microsoft pointed out that it would still trail Sony and market leader Tencent Holdings Ltd. in the gaming market after the takeover has been completed.The Biden administration’s antitrust officials have taken an aggressive tack with companies seeking to merge, often rejecting proposed settlements in favor of lawsuits. The Justice Department has filed a record 10 merger challenges since June 2021. The FTC also has blocked two major deals that sought regulatory approval based on pledges the merged company would play nice with its rivals –- Nvidia Corp.’s purchase of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank Group Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp.’s bid to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc.Then there’s the furor over Live Nation’s Ticketmaster unit after its botched launch of Taylor Swift concert ticket sales last week. The ticketing giant merged with Live Nation in 2010 after the Justice Department blessed its offer to license Ticketmaster’s software to other companies and pledge not to retaliate against venues that chose alternate ticketing vendors. Some lawmakers and advocates are now calling to unwind that merger, saying regulators should never have approved it in the first place.Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal also features another aspect that has piqued the interest of regulators –- major technology platforms using acquisitions to dominate emerging industries, in this case cloud gaming. Several tech companies launched forays into subscription gaming services using cloud technology including Microsoft, Sony, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. --although few have broken into the mainstream and, in September Google announced it would shut down its Stadia service.Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, which includes cloud gaming in its Ultimate package, leads the market with more than 25 million subscribers. In part, that’s because Microsoft’s dozens of game studios provide a direct channel of content. Activision Blizzard is expected to add enormously to the subscription service’s value proposition.UK regulators, who must also approve the acquisition, have highlighted concerns about cloud gaming as one of the main reasons they extended their review through March 2023. The deal could “tip or significantly increase concentration” of cloud gaming in Microsoft’s favor before rivals have a chance to develop, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekCar Price Divergence Hints at More Painful Inflation AheadTesla’s Lithium Lead at Risk as Rivals Make Supply DealsTikTok’s Viral Challenges Keep Luring Young Kids to Their DeathsHow to Keep Your Investments HalalGlobal Debt Costs Are Soaring.

With an influx of severe headwinds – particularly soaring inflation and geopolitical flashpoints – the equities sector represented a value trap. Few traders outside of those placing short bets enjoyed the volatility of the year so far. However, with much of the bad news baked in, it’s possible that certain undervalued fast money stocks can bounce back. Under this context, I’m seeking high-momentum names (or those that own the potential to engineer such momentum) for speculators in a hurry.CCitigroup$49.20BHPBHP Group$58.42PBRPetrobras$9.82GMGeneral Motors$39.95LPXLouisiana-Pacific$64,30WSMWilliams-Sonoma$123.25SIGSignet Jewelers$64.88Citigroup (C)The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest financial institutions in the world, Citigroup (NYSE:C) wouldn’t ordinarily qualify as one of the fast money stocks to buy. However, these are no ordinary times. With inflation reaching historic highs combined with geopolitical flashpoints, most equities sectors plunged this year. However, the financial sector appears to have garnered positive momentum, drawing attention to C stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSpecifically, Citigroup shares gained slightly over 10% in the trailing month since the close of the Nov. 21 session. However, on a year-to-date basis, C stock still finds itself down 22.5%, possibly suggesting greater room for growth. To be fair, the narrative is a speculative one. Essentially, with the Federal Reserve still committed to a hawkish monetary policy, subsequent economic weaknesses could hurt banking firms.Nevertheless, contrarians will almost surely find C attractive. Currently, shares trade for just under 7-times forward earnings. In contrast, the forward price-earnings ratio for the banking industry is 8.6 times, implying that C is undervalued.BHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockStory continuesBased in Australia, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is a metals and mining powerhouse. Its vast portfolio also includes natural gas and petroleum products, making it exceptionally relevant. Certainly, with Russia effectively blackmailing western nations with its hydrocarbon energy outflow cuts, more countries will rely on friendly jurisdictions like Australia.Another factor that bolsters BHP centers on its relevancies for the industries of tomorrow. With the company producing copper and nickel among other key commodities, BHP will likely undergird the future of mobility; in other words, electric vehicle production. At the moment, BHP enjoys significantly positive momentum. In the trailing month, shares gained nearly 17% of equity value. Since the start of the year, BHP is up a little over 6%, reflecting one of the few publicly traded securities in the black. Still, BHP trades for only 7-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings. In contrast, the sector median PE ratio is nearly 12 times. Therefore, BHP is worth a look regarding fast money stocks to buy.Petrobras (PBR)Petrobras distributor in the industry and supply sector.. PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comOne of the more compelling albeit riskier wagers in the global hydrocarbon sector, Brazil’s Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) gained just over 2% of equity value since the start of this year. Compared to other hydrocarbon players, that’s a rather disappointing performance. Still, those with a contrarian mindset regarding fast money stocks to buy should give another look at PBR. Specifically, PBR ranked among the highlights for unusual options activity for the session ended Nov. 21. Traders bid up multiple long call options with far expiration dates. For instance, the $8 calls with an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025 stands 787 days away from expiration since the order was placed. Despite the Fed’s intentions to control inflation, many traders view the macroeconomic backdrop as net positive for PBR stock.It’s hard to disagree. Corporate surveys (domestically) indicate that 90% of companies intend to resume in-office operations by 2023. Should other nations follow suit, Petrobras’ total addressable market will rise. Thus, PBR represents one of the fast money stocks to buy.General Motors (GM)General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logoSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.comOver the past several decades, American automakers became the butt of jokes due to their poor quality. However, in recent years, Detroit began seriously flexing its muscles. A clear example stems from General Motors (NYSE:GM). With the introduction of the eighth-generation Corvette along with the electrification of its several popular brands, GM offers a balanced approach to the future of mobility.Essentially, the automaker will cater to two distinct consumer bases until it’s no longer viable to do so. For right now, robust demand for the Corvette reveals that gearheads will continue to command a strong presence. However, GM will not let its EV segment slide. For instance, a popular pizza chain just secured a deal to buy EV fleets from GM. Fortunately for those seeking fast money stocks to buy, the fundamentals have translated to positive chart performance. Over the trailing month, GM shares gained almost 11% of equity value. As well, let’s not forget that GM is incredibly undervalued. Currently, shares trade at 6.3-times forward earnings, ranking favorably below 80% of the competition.Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)Businessman is drawing a growing virtual hologram stock bar chart on dark blue background representing value stocksSource: Costello77 / ShutterstockAnother unusual name for fast money stocks to buy, Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) is an American building materials manufacturer. Unfortunately, with the broader economy suffering from recessionary fears throughout 2022, LPX struggled. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20% of equity value. This performance is actually a bit worse than the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.Still, LPX may benefit from political initiative such as the so-called Build Back Better bill. With Washington focused on restoring American infrastructure following the coronavirus disaster, LPX may become a downwind beneficiary. Certainly, it appears that investors received the memo. In the trailing month, shares gained over 11% of market value. Further, the political impetus could make LPX a long-term idea, not just for fast money stocks.Finally, Louisiana-Pacific will likely court additional investors because of its value proposition. Currently, shares trade at 4-times TTM earnings. In contrast, the sector median PE ratio is a lofty 13 times. As well, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet, strong revenue trends and outstanding profitability metrics.Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Concept image of a person using a smart home app.A consumer retail firm that sells kitchenware and home furnishings, Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is a higher-risk name among fast money stocks. Just look at the consumer sentiment index, which presently trends near historic lows. Unless this index swings higher, the presumption is that WSM will struggle. Certainly, shares fell over 29% YTD, reflecting deep concerns. So, why mention WSM at all as one of the fast money stocks to buy? The thing is, Williams-Sonoma doesn’t cater to your regular consumer base. Rather, the company’s pricey products attract higher-income crowds. And the reality of the post-pandemic new normal dictates that affluent segment made off like bandits. Stated differently, WSM enables investors to cynically bank on trends associated with the widening wealth gap.Furthermore, Williams-Sonoma brings an attractive value proposition to the table. The company enjoys a solid balance sheet and outstanding revenue and profit margins. Even with these attributes, WSM trades at only 7.6-times forward earnings. This compares with the industry median forward PE ratio of 14.2 times.Signet Jewelers (SIG)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockPersonally, if I had to pick a name among fast money stocks to buy, I’d probably go with the first six names. However, those that truly want to bank on the wealth gap phenomenon can target Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG). To be clear, SIG dropped nearly 33% of equity value since the start of this year. However, in the trailing six months, SIG gained almost 14%, reflecting budding enthusiasm.Also, Signet plays into social trends following the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic. As many research papers and journalistic reports indicated, social isolation represented a huge problem during the worst of the crisis. Now that the broader ecosystem is normalizing, it’s an opportunity for folks to reconnect. And you never know – this circumstance may have sparked pent-up demand for marriages, which would bode well for SIG stock.On a final note, those that want to take the plunge should note that Signet also offers an attractive value proposition. Currently, SIG trades at 5.4-times forward earnings, which ranks below nearly 93% of the competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

59,07224698-61e7-3c7a-9a0c-633c30e6dcde,SBUX,2022-11-26,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-starbucks-corporation-130012591.html,1669467612,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks Is Starbucks Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.62bUS$3.87bUS$4.84bUS$5.94bUS$6.55bUS$7.00bUS$7.37bUS$7.70bUS$7.98bUS$8.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.88%Est @ 5.41%Est @ 4.38%Est @ 3.66%Est @ 3.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.9kUS$4.4kUS$4.5kUS$4.5kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$4.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$149bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$149b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$71bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$112b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$99.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Starbucks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.099. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Starbucks, there are three important aspects you should look at:Risks: To that end, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Starbucks (including 2 which are potentially serious) .Future Earnings: How does SBUX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the agriculture sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development forecasts a 15% increase in global demand for agricultural output over the next ten years, which will be met by improved agricultural methods used by producers everywhere. The agricultural sector significantly impacts several regional, national, and international economic sectors. It accounts for 4% of the global GDP and more than 25% of GDP in developing countries. Understanding what is happening in this sector and how it will impact food production and distribution is crucial for everyone, from farmers and real estate investors to supermarkets and dining establishments.After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, several significant uncertainties make it hard to forecast the future prognosis for any business precisely. Because of the close ties between the energy and fertilizer sectors, this might have an impact on global agriculture suppliers. Russian exports of potash, ammonia, urea and other organic fertilizers have been significantly hampered due to Western sanctions on the country. Farmers worldwide are using less fertilizer and growing fewer crops due to the exorbitant fertilizer expenses.As of November 15, 2022, the world's population reached 8 billion, three times that in 1950. There will be 8.5 billion people on the planet by 2030, 9.7 billion by 2050, and 10.4 billion by the end of the century. Therefore, to fulfil the increasing food demand in 2050, global agriculture production must grow by about 50% from the present levels. The challenge for farmers, governments, and scientists is to increase food production without accelerating environmental deterioration and the climatic problem. AI-powered solutions that improve crop quality, quantity, and market entry time can help farmers become more productive.Story continuesPhoto by Sebastian Gómez on UnsplashPrecision agriculture, often known as artificial intelligence systems, is assisting in enhancing the overall quality and accuracy of harvests. The potential that artificial intelligence (AI) offers for the interpretation of satellite imagery for field surveillance is one of the most effective uses of AI in agriculture. This technology makes the identification of pests, plant diseases, and undernutrition of farms easier. Prior to choosing which herbicide should be used in the region, artificial intelligence (AI) sensors may recognize and target weeds. Herbicide use is reduced, as a result, lowering expenses. Furthermore, employing AI-based robots for agricultural harvesting aids in managing the labor shortage. AI also makes smart decisions, such as optimal plant time, crop yields, and forecasting prices. Robots have been created by businesses like Harvest Automation and Nexus Robotics for picking fragile food and pulling weeds, respectively. These trends, combined or used in any combination, will impact every aspect of the agriculture industry. The global AI in agriculture market was worth USD 1.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 25.1% to reach USD 4.2 billion by 2028.Agribusiness is currently in high demand. Due to the size required for operations, a few industry giants like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) control the bulk of the market share. As a result, these agricultural equities are in the limelight and appear poised for long-term success.Our MethodologyIn order to identify the best agriculture stocks to buy now, we first started with the 189 positions in iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers ETF (VEGI). VEGI invests in global agriculture stocks that have exposure to ""companies that produce fertilizers and agricultural chemicals, farm machinery, and packaged foods, and meats"". We then used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of hedge fund sentiment scores to rank these stocks based on their popularity among the 920 hedge funds that recently reported their 13F portfolios.Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now14.

Outside of that exogenous event, Cal-Maine is well positioned amid an industry shift to cage-free eggs. Cal-Maine invested ahead of competitors in upgrading facilities — spending on its upgrades when inflation was lower — which we believe should prove an additional boon enabling ongoing share gains.”13.

63,26aa930b-68a3-3ac7-bda0-b3cc6a2c8857,ADM,2022-11-26,Top 5 Growth Stocks to Gain From a Likely Year-End Rally,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-growth-stocks-gain-130301306.html,1669381381,STORY,['ADM'],"[Just 25 days of trading are left to complete 2022, which has been rather disappointing. Throughout the year, the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, which has been further complicated by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 5.9%, 15.5% and 27.9%, respectively.However, recently released several inflation data for October have shown that peak inflation may be behind us. The Fed’s November FOMC minutes revealed that the majority of officials prefer a relatively dovish-monetary stance going forward.As the Fed is expected to lower the magnitude of its rate hike in the December FOMC meeting, we may witness a year-end rally in Wall Street, which is likely to boost growth stocks. To tap a possible gain, we have selected five growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These are — Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. LW, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA, HF Sinclair Corp. DINO and Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD.Wall Street Likely to See a Year-End RallyAlthough the Fed is yet to signal any shift from its ultra-hawkish monetary policies, a section of Fed officials has recently spoken in a relatively dovish tone. The minutes of the Fed’s November FOMC meeting revealed that a “substantial majority” of Fed officials favor reducing the magnitude of the interest rate hike going forward.The FOMC minute stated ""A number of participants observed that, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the Committee's goals, it would become appropriate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.""The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3.75% so far in 2022 with a 75 basis-point rise in the last four FOMC meetings. At present, the Fed fund rate is within the range of 3.75-4%. At present, per the CME FedWatch, there exists a 75.8% probability that the central bank will reduce the magnitude of rate hike to 50 basis points in December FOMC.Story continuesIn his post-FOMC statement in November, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the terminal interest rate may go beyond 5% as estimated earlier and a soft landing of the economy may not be realized. However, with several important Fed officials recently expressing their dovish views, market participants are unsure of whether the terminal interest rate will cross the 5% threshold or stay below that.Moreover,  U.S. GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) today announced a new regional structure and related senior management changes to enable continued growth as a multicategory leader internationally and advance its rapid transition toward a smoke-free future.""We are changing the company’s regional structure to further support the growth of our smoke-free business, reinforce consumer centricity, and increase the speed of innovation and deployment—all in alignment with our ambition of becoming a majority smoke-free business by net revenues by 2025,"" said Jacek Olczak, PMI’s Chief Executive Officer. ""The new structure will also create new opportunities to further grow our senior talent, deepening the bench of leaders who will spearhead PMI’s progress toward a smoke-free future for the years to come. I am confident of the exceptional caliber and determination of our people and wish them the best in their new roles.""By the end of January 2023, PMI will rearrange its operations in four regions, down from the current six, under the leadership of the following members of senior management:Paul Riley, currently President, East Asia &amp; Australia Region, will be appointed President, East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region;Frederic de Wilde, currently President, European Union Region, will be appointed President, South and Southeast Asia (SSEA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Middle East and Africa (MEA) Region;Massimo Andolina, currently Senior Vice President, Operations, will be appointed President, Europe Region; andDeepak Mishra, who will continue as President, Americas Region.Drago Azinovic, currently President, Middle East and Africa and PMI Duty Free Region, will leave the organization after a transition period.In addition, the following appointments will also take effect:Marco Mariotti, currently President, Eastern Europe Region, will be appointed President, CIS, Central Asia &amp; Israel, reporting into Frederic de Wilde;Stacey Kennedy, currently President, South and Southeast Asia Region, will be appointed Chief Executive Officer of PMI’s U.S. business, reporting to Deepak Mishra; andScott Coutts, currently Vice President, Global Manufacturing, will be appointed Senior Vice President, Operations, succeeding Massimo Andolina and reporting into Jacek Olczak.Story continuesThe new regional structure better aligns with the business strategy in the approximately 180 markets where PMI’s products are sold. It is designed to accelerate smoke-free product growth in markets where IQOS already holds double-digit market shares, while also driving the transition from cigarettes to smoke-free products in untapped markets—including as of April 2024, the U.S., the world’s largest smoke-free market as described in our recent press release.Furthermore, the new regional structure will further support PMI’s efforts to broaden access to smoke-free products worldwide for those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, including in low and middle income markets, which the company aspires to account for at least half of the markets where its smoke-free products will be available by 2025. Each region will comprise individual markets, as well as clusters of markets, and will provide opportunities to accelerate career development within PMI’s diverse talent pipeline.The company’s quarterly results’ reporting and related filings will reflect the new regional structure as of Q1 2023.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that an exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health. As of September 30, 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 70 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 13.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, in February 2021, PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet consumer and patient needs.

PM is committed to replacing cigarettes with scientific and innovative smoke-free alternatives. Recently, the company launched its latest heat-not-burn tobacco heating system — BONDS by IQOS — with its accompanying designed tobacco sticks, BLENDS.BONDS by IQOS, designed only to be used with BLENDS tobacco sticks, will be available in five different flavors like menthol, classic and aromatic. BONDS by IQOS was piloted in the Philippines, with commercialization expected in the rest of 2022 and 2023.The newly unveiled product offers adults access to low-maintenance, compact and hassle-free smoke-free products as a better alternative to cigarettes. BONDS by IQOS heats tobacco rather than burning it, which gives authentic tobacco taste satisfaction with a lower smell than cigarettes and no ash. The heating of tobacco in BONDS by IQOS emits 95% lower harmful chemicals when compared to cigarettes.The move is in sync with Philip Morris’ efforts to accelerate the achievement of a smoke-free future. Management highlighted that at the end of 2021, PMI’s smoke-free products were available in 30 LMIC markets. By 2025, Philip Morris expects at least 40 million adults to have switched to its smoke-free products and over 50% of its total net revenues to come from smoke-free products. As of Sep 30, 2022, management projects that there were almost 19.5 million total IQOS users (excluding Russia and Ukraine), of which nearly 13.5 million have switched to IQOS and given up smoking.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Driving Growth?Serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products (RRPs). The company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating more than 30% of the company’s net revenues in the third quarter of 2022. The company is well placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.Philip Morris has long been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has aided its revenues and adjusted operating income even in the face of the unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. In fact, higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance across most regions during the third quarter of 2022. During the quarter, both the top and the bottom line improved year over year and beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.For 2022, the company expects proforma adjusted net revenues to increase by nearly 6.5-8% on an organic basis (compared with 6-8% before). Proforma adjusted earnings per share (EPS), excluding currency impacts, is expected to increase 10-12% to the $6.09-$6.20 range in 2022.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 1.6% in the past three months against the industry’s 0.1% decline.Story continues3 Solid Staple PicksSome top-ranked stocks are The Chef's Warehouse CHEF, General Mills GIS and Conagra Brands CAG.The Chef's Warehouse, which engages in the distribution of specialty food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

67,ffa19f09-8a76-3e2c-8d3e-dcc6939cbb0d,HCA,2022-11-26,HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) Looks To Prolong Its Impressive Returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hca-healthcare-nyse-hca-looks-130029624.html,1669467629,STORY,['HCA'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at HCA Healthcare's (NYSE:HCA) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on HCA Healthcare is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$9.0b ÷ (US$51b - US$9.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, HCA Healthcare has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for HCA Healthcare compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering HCA Healthcare here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For HCA Healthcare Tell Us?It's hard not to be impressed by HCA Healthcare's returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 22% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 38% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.The Bottom Line On HCA Healthcare's ROCEIn short, we'd argue HCA Healthcare has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 198% return they've received over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Shares have added about 16.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Community Health Systems due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Community Health Miss Q3 Earnings EstimatesCommunity Health reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted net loss of 52 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 5 cents. The quarterly figure compares unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s profit of 69 cents.Net operating revenues amounted to $3,025 million, which declined 2.9% year over year in the third quarter. The top line also missed the consensus mark by 1.2%.The weak third-quarter results were caused by lower admissions, patient days, occupancy rate and higher operating costs. Hurricane Ian in Florida also negatively impacted its results. However, investors were likely impressed by the company’s cost-containment efforts in the face of inflation, which brought down its cost of supplies. Further, the company stuck to its previous guidance, despite taking a hit from Hurricane Ian in the third quarter, showing resilience.Quarterly Operational UpdateThe number of hospitals at the third-quarter end was 81 million. Patient days declined 13.6% year over year in the third quarter. Average length of stay declined 9.8% year over year, while the occupancy rate decreased 680 basis points to 46.7%.Admissions slipped 3.7% year over year, but adjusted admissions rose 3.8% year over year in the quarter under review. On a same-store basis, admissions dipped 2.2% year over year, but adjusted admissions improved 5.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesCommunity Health had 13,309 licensed beds as of Sep 30, 2022, which increased from 13,229 a year ago.Income from operations declined 40% year over year to $204 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 17% year over year to $400 million in the third quarter.Total operating costs and expenses were $2,821 million, which escalated from $2,775 million a year ago. Salaries and benefits and other operating expenses increased in the third quarter while the cost of supplies declined. Meanwhile, CYH’s interest expense, net, increased marginally to $217 million from $216 million a year ago.Financial Update (as of Sep 30, 2022)Community Health exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $300 million, down from the 2021-end figure of $507 million. Total assets at the third-quarter end were $14,914 million, down from $15,217 million at 2021-end.Long-term debt amounted to $11,943 million, which declined from the $12,109 million level at 2021-end. Current maturities of long-term debt were at $21 million.Net cash provided by operating activities was at $137 million in the third quarter of 2022, up from $121 million in the year-ago period.2022 Outlook in DetailsCYH reaffirmed its previous 2022 annual earnings guidance of a net loss per share of $2.55-$1.65.Adjusted EBITDA was projected within the $1,300-$1,400 million range. The outlook suggests a decline from $1,969 million in 2021. Net operating revenues were expected in the range of $12,200-$12,500 million compared with the year-ago level of $12,368 million. For the medium-term (4 years), net revenue growth was expected in the mid-single digit.Net cash provided by operating activities was anticipated to lie between $500 million and $600 million for 2022. Last year, CYH reported net cash used in operations of $131 million. Capex was expected within $450-$500 million.The company now expects labor inflation for 2023 to be within the 3-4% range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 6.25% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Community Health Systems has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Community Health Systems has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCommunity Health Systems belongs to the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry.

69,716a9a6b-d3f7-3ac5-aa96-509192adc0bb,PPG,2022-11-26,Olin (OLN) Up 10.9% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/olin-oln-10-9-since-163104485.html,1669393864,STORY,"['PPG', 'OLN']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Olin (OLN). Shares have added about 10.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Olin due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Olin's Earnings Surpass Estimates in Q3, Sales LagOlin posted a profit of $315.2 million or $2.18 per share in third-quarter 2022, down from $390.7 million or $2.38 per share in the year-ago quarter. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86.The company's revenues fell roughly 0.8% year over year to $2,321.7 million in the quarter. It missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,384.7 million. The company’s chemical businesses faced headwinds from European and North American epoxy and vinyls intermediate demand slowdown and higher Asian exports. However, it benefited from higher pricing in the quarter.Segment ReviewChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls: Revenues in the division rose roughly 19% year over year to $1,263.5 million in the reported quarter.

That would come in below last year's 13.5% jump and the 9.3% gain in 2020.Retailers began offering unusually early discounts this year.Target Corp, Kohls Corp and Amazon.com Inc ran early Black Friday deals that discounted toys and some other goods by as much as 50%.Those companies did not respond to requests for comment.Even with steep discounts, consumers will have to spend more for popular products like a PJ Masks toy car or Mattel Inc's Mega Hauler semi-truck because prices have risen faster than promotions, according to data provided by DataWeave.Mattel did not respond to a request to comment.Shoppers are being wooed as the closely followed University of Michigan consumer sentiment poll was revised up Wednesday to up to 56.8 from 54.7, beating the consensus expectation of 55.0 but still below the 59.9 in October. Expectations for purchasing long-lasting manufactured goods fell 21% due to high interest rates and high prices, the survey found.""The sentiment data has been sliding sideways as consumers try to reconcile solid economic and labor market conditions against expectations of a recession and harmful inflation,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Anna Driver and Richard Chang)]"

Shares of APTV have increased 19.6% in the past month compared with 2.3% growth of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors That Augur WellAptiv has a sound liquidity position. Its current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 2.66 at the end of third-quarter 2022, higher than 2.63 at the end of the second quarter and 2.11 in the prior-year quarter. A current ratio greater than 1.5 is usually considered a tailwind. This may imply that the risk of default is less.Acquisition is a key growth trajectory for Aptiv. In January 2022, APTV had announced that it inked a deal to purchase Wind River from TPG Capital. On completion, Wind River will be part of the acquirer’s Advanced Safety and User Experience segment.Through this buyout, Aptiv will merge Wind River Studio offering with its complementary SVA platform and automotive expertise to strengthen its place in automotive software solutions. It will also enable APTV to equip automotive clients with a faster and economical path to full-vehicle software architecture.Moreover, APTV is exposed to the lucrative connected cars market. With safety becoming a key selling point for connected cars, automakers are increasingly seeking related technologies. This is one of the reasons behind the quick advancement of the driver-assistance system market.A Key RiskAptiv is witnessing an escalation in costs as it continues to invest in both organic and inorganic growth, and remains embroiled in legal matters. Investments in products like autonomous driving software are expected to make meaningful contributions to APTV’s growth post 2022, indicating that acceptance and integration of technology will take longer time.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAptiv currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with the outlook so far. So, Ali, how is it looking.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rochelle. You're right. You know, the content, it isn't really there like it's been in years past, but we do have some new titles out over this weekend that could surprise at the box office. If we take a look at the theatrical exclusives this weekend, we have a lot of Disney with the animated film ""Strange World."" We should also see continued success from ""Wakanda Forever,"" but probably one of the most anticipated is that sequel to ""Knives Out.""Now this movie will only be available in select markets for one week before it moves over to Netflix at the end of December, but I spoke with Sean Robbins. He's the chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro, and he told me that the level of success here could really make this a watershed moment when it comes to the relationship between streaming platforms and exhibitors as this is probably the most talked about, the buzziest streaming title to open exclusively in cinemas. And it's just this vote of confidence when it comes to the theatrical experience, when it comes to the ability for the box office to really turn a profit for these types of films.We did get the news earlier this week that Amazon will reportedly be investing $1 billion to produce 12 to 15 movies a year exclusively for theaters, and that report sent shares of movie theater chains like AMC and Cinemark higher. So I think there's still a lot more to come when we think about this relationship. We've come a long way from 2020 and 2021, but Netflix, of course, has largely been resistant. So we'll see if ""Glass Onion"" can change that type of strategy.Story continuesOverall, though the Thanksgiving box office is expected to pull in about 100 million plus over the three-day weekend, 140 million plus over the five days. So as you can see that's roughly on par with 2021, but we're still significantly below 2019 levels with that three-day pulling in 181 million and the five-day, a whopping 262 million. And a lot of that has to do with the types of movies that are out. Hopefully, we'll see that start to stabilize in 2023.- Yeah, Ali, I haven't even watched the first ""Knives Out."" I got a lot of catching up to do this weekend.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You do. Good.- I've heard great reviews. As you said, you know, this weekend has historically been the kickoff to what is a busy holiday movie season. Hasn't been the case the last few years. But how are things stacking up? What's the pipeline looking like going into year end?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Absolutely the biggest film coming up in year end is the sequel ""Avatar 2."" This has been a movie that James Cameron has been talking about for years. The original ""Avatar"" aired in 2009, so a lot of time people have been waiting for this. And the film got the green light this week to air in China, and that was also a huge deal for Hollywood, a huge deal for this movie. That country has been notorious when it comes to rejecting films, and if we take a look at ticket sales from that original ""Avatar"" in 2009, overall, it grossed $2.74 billion with $202 million coming from mainland China.So that's a significant market for these types of films. And overall, ""Avatar 2,"" it cost a pretty penny. Reports have it at around $250 million plus, so it needs to do well. And in terms of the projections, we have a long range forecast from Boxoffice Pro between $135 million to $175 million, so that's the number to watch.I do have high expectations. People love this franchise. It's certainly a long time coming, but we'll have to wait and see if it can deliver. But considering this is probably going to be the biggest film at the end of the year, we're not-- it's not gonna really have that much competition. I do think all eyes are going to be on this, and it's going to continue well into the first quarter of 2023 as well.- Yeah, I mean, just the kind of movie that you want to actually go to the theaters to watch if you saw the first ""Avatar,"" but we'll be watching that one as well. Thanks so much for that, Ali.]"

The Aasta Hansteen gas field has been operational since 2018.The Irpa gas project will extend the lifespan of the Aasta Hansteen platform from 2032 to 2039. Equinor mentioned that there will be joint production from the Irpa and Aasta Hansteen fields through 2031. The development will ensure steady gas supplies from Aasta Hansteen.The gas extracted from the Irpa field will be brought into existing infrastructure through the Aasta Hansteen spar platform. It will then be transported to the Nyhamna gas processing facility through the Polarled pipeline. From there, customers in the U.K. and continental Europe will receive gas via the Langeled pipeline system.As Europe faces uncertainty over gas supplies, the development of the Irpa gas project will contribute to long-term supplies of gas to customers in the EU and the U.K.Price PerformanceShares of Equinor have underperformed the industry in the past six months.

As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, the downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, reefing and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Murphy USA MUSA and PBF Energy PBF have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products’ terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSrong Refined Products Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products’ consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 4% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Attractive Margins: The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs earlier this year. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high. Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Higher Costs &amp; Inflationary Pressures: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners’ ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers. Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What’s worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. While the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have increased 159.7% in the past year, the same for 2023 have risen 143.2% over the same timeframe.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 45% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 31.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 15.8%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.35X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.22X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.39X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.67X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years)  4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMarathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

OVV reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98. The downside in results can be attributed to a year-over-year dip in production and much higher costs. Moreover, $1.44 was lower than the year-ago bottom line’s profit of $1.50 per share.However, total revenues of $3.55 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.52 billion due to higher-than-expected total oil and natural gas liquid production. Total oil production came in at 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 136,000 BOE/d. The top line improved by about 98.4% from the year-ago sales of $1.79 billion.OVV’s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share for its common shareholders of record as of Dec 15, 2022.

Helping, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester just said, “We’re at a point where we’re going to enter a restrictive stance of policy. At that point, I think it makes sense that we can slow down a bit the … pace of increases. We’re still going to raise the fund’s rate, but we’re at a reasonable point now where we can be very deliberate in setting monetary policy, as quoted by CNBC. With that, some of the fear in the market has cooled off, creating a very long list of stocks to watch, including:SHLSShoals Technologies$29.85COINCoinbase$42.94MSTRMicroStrategy$165.41TANInvesco Solar ETF$81.06MMacy’s$23.34ROSTRoss Stores$114.33DISWalt Disney$95.40Shoals Technologies (SHLS)ESG stocks: Solar energy panels are arranged in a green field under a sunny sky.Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.comSolar energy stocks could see brighter days ahead. For example, Shoals (NASDAQ:SHLS) just reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with record Q3 revenue of $93 million. The company also increased the lower end of its full-year revenue guidance and announced that it expects its EBITDA, excluding certain items, to come in at an impressive $80 million to $86 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCEO Jason Whitaker noted that the company was benefiting from a tariff exemption on Chinese solar panels implemented by President Joe Biden, along with high natural gas prices and the climate bill passed by Congress. Moreover, China, which has clearly made the decision to move towards reopening its economy, is likely to continue doing so, reassuring the Street that the Asian nation is going to continue pumping out solar panels at a fast pace and possibly even accelerate its production of solar products. With solar panel supplies running behind demand, China’s reopening should boost Shoals’ business and SHLS stock next month. Further, providing Shoals and SHLS stock with another positive catalyst, the European Union is likely to continue to implement its package of pro-solar rules and incentives next month.Story continuesCoinbase (COIN)The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.Source: Primakov / Shutterstock.comCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) isn’t a buy just yet, especially with a plethora of negative catalysts. First, the alleged misdeeds of failed crypto exchange FTX, along with the tremendous amount of publicity that the media has given the exchange’s collapse, have undermined confidence in crypto exchanges in general. Although COIN’s contention that it has done nothing wrong may be absolutely correct, fear is likely to cause COIN’s customers to rush to withdraw their crypto from the exchange. There is a high likelihood that such a scenario, in turn, could cause a classic “bank run” event, quickly causing COIN to run out of cash. Since no government or large bank is likely to come to COIN’s rescue and no one is going to want to buy its stock, the bank run could easily result in bankruptcy.On another front, the U.S. government is also indicating that it will respond to FTX’s failure by more tightly regulating the crypto sector. Increased regulation of the sector could greatly undermine Coinbase’s business. After all, FTX’s failure and alleged misdeeds could give the agency reason to be extremely harsh on Coinbase. As if all that wasn’t enough, Bitcoin has tumbled to two-year lows, likely further deterring investors from placing trades on Coinbase’s exchange. Given all of these points, stocks like COIN are highly likely to keep sinking next month, providing investors with a very good short-selling opportunity.MicroStrategy (MSTR)MICROSTRATEGY - sign at headquarters building. MSTR stock.Source: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.comCryptocurrency stocks like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) spent a lot of funds on Bitcoin (BTC-USD). As of June, 30, it held 129,698 Bitcoin. At a (hypothetical) average price of $20,000 per Bitcoin, that works out to a nearly $2.6 billion investment in the crypto. Worse, in Sept. the company sought to sell $500 million of MSTR stock to buy even more Bitcoin. Bitcoin has tumbled an eye-popping 66% this year and 22% in just the last month. After FTX’s implosion and the tremendous retreat of Bitcoin this year, not many investors are going to have the stomach to buy the crypto and most are likely to look to unload it. Therefore, its value is likely to continue to plunge going forward.Bitcoin seems to have failed completely both as a hedge against inflation and as a store of value. Moreover, few if any consumers or companies are actually using it. Rather, in line with my longtime predictions, it’s now obvious that Bitcoin and other cryptos are primarily bubbles that inflate when there’s a great deal of stimulus in the economy and deflate when the “punch bowl” is taken away. With the bowl being withdrawn, Bitcoin is likely to continue to plunge, causing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment to also continue to tumble. As a result, MSTR stock is likely to keep plunging next month and is not one of the top stocks to buy at this point.Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comWith the U.S. and EU providing tremendous support for solar energy, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) could see brighter days ahead. Also worth noting is that the U.S. Commerce Department is due to decide by Dec. 1 whether to accept a petition to impose tariffs on solar panels imported from a number of Southeast Asian countries. As I mentioned when discussing Shoals, President Biden has implemented a two-year exemption on solar panel imports from Southeast Asia. Therefore, an adverse decision by the department will not negatively affect solar companies for some time, and the exemption gives them adequate time to adjust their supply chains in preparation for the imposition of tariffs on panels imported from the affected countries.If, however, the department decides to reject the petition, solar stocks, including TAN, are likely to rally, due to the removal of a “headline risk” that has been facing the sector. The fact that the climate bill passed by Democrats provides a great deal of financial support for domestic solar companies could give the department the “cover” it needs to reject the petition.In a separate development, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) recently initiated coverage of a number of U.S.-based solar stocks with “buy” ratings. Among the names to which it gave “buy” ratings are three of TAN’s six largest holdings — Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH), Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN), and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR).Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comSome retail stocks, like Macy’s (NYSE:M) just delivered “beat-and-raise” third-quarter results. The apparel retailer’s revenue fell 4% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, but its sales came in slightly above analysts’ average outlook. Better, on the bottom line, Macy’s reported Q3 EPS of 53 cents, meaningfully higher than analysts’ mean outlook of 19 cents. And the company increased its full-year EPS estimate, excluding some items, to $4.07-$4.27 from $4-$4,20 previously.In addition, the comparable sales of Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s luxury store, increased 4% year-over-year last quarter. The increase suggests that Macy’s high-end customers could spend a great deal at Bloomingdale’s over the holiday shopping season, boosting Macy’s bottom line and making investors more upbeat about M stock. Additionally, the healthy increase in Bloomingdale’s comparable sales suggests that high-end consumers in general, in line with my previous predictions, are starting to spend more money on goods again. As inflation eases and we enter the heart of the holiday shopping season, middle-class consumers are likely to follow suit, causing investors to become more confident in Macy’s. Given all of these points, M stock will probably rise significantly next month and looks like a good stock to buy at this point.Ross Stores (ROST)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockDiscount retailer Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) reported better-than-expected Q3 results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, leaving its stock well-positioned to rally in Dec. On the bottom line, Ross reported Q3 EPS of $1, versus analysts’ average estimate of 82 cents. Its revenue was little changed YOY, coming in at $4.57 billion, $200 million above analysts’ mean estimate. The retailer’s comparable sales fell 3% year-over-year, but the company pointed out that its comp sales had soared 14% YOY in Q3 of 2021. ROST increased its 2022 EPS outlook to $4.21-$4.34, versus its previous guidance of $3.84-$4.12.In the wake of Ross’ results, research firm Gordon Haskett raised its rating on ROST to “buy” from “hold,” as it believes that the company’s results were “dramatically better than expected.” The firm thinks that Ross appears to have “turned a corner,” while the discount-retailer sector can reward investors going forward. “We remain in the early innings of a trade-down which, when coupled with material freight expense relief and…healthy [gross margins], paves the way for a very meaningful upward EPS revision cycle,” the firm stated.Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockThe abrupt return of former Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger seems to have enchanted the Street. Apparently many investors believe that Iger, who replaced the hapless Bob Chapek, can return the old magic to Disney and DIS stock. With Disney not scheduled to report any quarterly earnings until early Feb. and views of the U.S. economy likely to improve as inflation continues to weaken, optimism about Iger’s return could push DIS stock much higher next month.However, the “changing of the Bobs” doesn’t alter my longtime, bearish stance on Disney and DIS stock. That’s because, with cable continuing to bleed subscribers at a significant rate, the revenue and profits of the company’s lucrative cable channels are going to continue to sink. Meanwhile, the company’s streaming channels are likely to lose money for the foreseeable future, and movie attendance in the U.S. will probably keep trending far below pre-pandemic levels.From what I’ve read, Iger’s big point of difference with Chapek involves charging less for the company’s streaming channels. That change might push up the number of consumers subscribing to Disney+. But I believe that the Street is well past the point of being impressed by the channel’s subscriber numbers and has figured out that streaming is not, in the near term or medium term, going to offset the profit declines caused by the weakening of the company’s cable and movie businesses. As a result, I recommend that investors sell stocks, such as DIS stock into strength in Dec. and Jan.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in SHLS and a short position in COIN.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is NRG Energy (NRG). NRG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.35, which compares to its industry's average of 15.39. Over the last 12 months, NRG's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.06 and as low as 4.45, with a median of 8.31.We also note that NRG holds a PEG ratio of 0.77.

NRG's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.19. NRG's PEG has been as high as 1.24 and as low as 0.13, with a median of 0.62, all within the past year.Investors should also recognize that NRG has a P/B ratio of 1.95. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. NRG's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.21. NRG's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 1.59, with a median of 1.99, over the past year.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that NRG has a P/CF ratio of 3.51. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 12.69. Within the past 12 months, NRG's P/CF has been as high as 3.75 and as low as 1.72, with a median of 2.57.RWE AG (RWEOY) may be another strong Utility - Electric Power stock to add to your shortlist.

Shares have added about 10.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Masco due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Masco Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Lag Estimates, 2022 View DownMasco Corporation reported results for third-quarter 2022, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has been grappling with lower demand, higher operational costs and additional foreign currency headwinds.Inside the HeadlinesMasco reported adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share, which lagged the consensus mark of $1.07 by 8.4%. Adjusted earnings declined by a cent from the year ago.Net sales of $2,204 million missed the consensus estimate of $2,264 million by 2.7% but remained flat from the prior-year quarter. Net sales increased 3% year over year in local currency, excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Sales in the North American region increased 3% from the prior-year quarter’s figure and 5% internationally in local currency.Segmental AnalysisPlumbing Products: Sales in the segment remained flat year over year to $1,324 million. In local currency, the segment’s sales (excluding acquisitions and divestitures) increased 5% year over year. The operating margin contracted 210 basis points (bps) year over year to 16.6% due to lower volumes, higher operational costs and currency. Adjusted EBITDA declined 10.9% year over year.Decorative Architectural Products: The segment reported sales of $880 million, up 1% from the prior-year period’s number. The operating margin declined 180 bps to 17.2% due to lower volumes and higher freight and material costs, partially offset by higher net selling prices. Adjusted EBITDA declined 8.6% year over year.Story continuesMargins PerformanceAdjusted gross margin contracted 270 bps from the prior-year level to 31.5%.

Shares have added about 25.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Boeing due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Boeing Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/YThe Boeing Company incurred an adjusted loss of $6.18 per share for third-quarter 2022, much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny. The bottom line also deteriorated from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 60 cents.The year-over-year downside can be attributed to losses on fixed-price defense development programs.Including one-time items, the company posted GAAP earnings of $5.49 per share compared with 19 cents reported in the third quarter of 2021.RevenuesIn the quarter under review, Boeing’s revenues amounted to $15.96 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.50 billion by 8.8%. The top line however improved 4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $15.28 billion.This improvement was driven by higher year-over-year revenues registered by the company’s Commercial Airplanes and Global Services business units.Total BacklogBacklog at the end of third-quarter 2022 increased to $381.32 billion from $371.73 billion at the end of second-quarter 2022.Segmental PerformancesCommercial Airplane: Revenues at this segment increased 40% year over year to $6.26 billion, driven by higher 737 deliveries and the resumption of 787 deliveries. The segment incurred an operating loss of $643 million compared with a loss of $693 million in the year-ago quarter.Boeing delivered 112 commercial planes during the quarter under review, up 32% year over year.The backlog for this segment remained healthy, with over 4,300 airplanes valued at $307 billion.Story continuesBoeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS): This segment recorded revenues worth $5.31 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 20%, primarily on account of losses on certain fixed-price development programs,Meanwhile, this unit incurred an operating loss of $2.80 billion against an operating income of $436 million in the year-ago quarter.The backlog at BDS was $55 billion, 31% of which comprised orders from international clients.Global Services: Revenues at this segment improved 5% to $4.43 billion on account of higher commercial services volume and a favorable mix. This unit generated an operating income of $733 million compared with $644 million in the year-ago quarter.Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC): This segment reported quarterly revenues of $52 million compared with $71 million in the year-ago quarter.At the end of third-quarter 2022, BCC's portfolio balance was $1.6 billion.Financial ConditionBoeing exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $13.49 billion and short-term and other investments of $0.76 billion. At the end of 2021, the company had $8.05 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $8.19 billion of short-term and other investments. Long-term debt amounted to $51.79 billion at the end of third-quarter 2022, down from $56.81 billion at 2021 end.The company’s operating cash outflow as of Sep 30, 2022 was $3.14 billion compared with $3.87 billion at the end of third-quarter 2021.Free cash outflow totaled $0.55 billion at the end of third-quarter 2022 compared with $4.13 billion at the end of third-quarter 2021.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 112.5% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Boeing has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

103,626f5bc5-d703-36f7-83c7-cf0fdf963b0c,PHM,2022-11-26,"PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-attracting-investor-140002652.html,1669384802,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +13.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 16.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share, indicating a change of +15.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.14 points to a change of +38.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.05 indicates a change of -30.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -13.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $15.66 billion and $14.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.5% and -7.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

104,7b23d788-f526-37be-b8dd-c90bd7ea9c90,PHM,2022-11-26,Ethan Allen Interiors and PulteGroup have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethan-allen-interiors-pultegroup-highlighted-133801119.html,1669383481,STORY,"['ETD', 'PHM', 'EOG', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 25, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. ETD as the Bull of the Day and PulteGroup, Inc. PHM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Baker Hughes Company BKR, EOG Resources EOG and Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. is defying expectations as consumers continue to buy furniture. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is dirt cheap, with a single digit P/E.Ethan Allen Interiors is a home furnishings retailer which sells a full range of home furnishings through a retail network of design centers across the United States and abroad as well as online at ethanallen.com. It's been in business for 90 years.The company owns 10 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Mexico and Honduras, including one sawmill, one rough mill and a lumberyard. Approximately 75% of its products are made, or assembled, in those North American facilities.Another Beat in the Fiscal First Quarter 2023On Oct 26, Ethan Allen reported its fiscal first quarter 2023 results and beat the Zacks Consensus, reporting $1.11 versus the Consensus of just $0.79.It was the 13th consecutive earnings beat in a row. Ethan Allen has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit.Sales rose 17.7% to $214.5 million thanks to a higher backlog of orders.Retail net sales were up 18.5% to $183.7 million while wholesale net sales rose 4.8% to $114.7 million.The orders cooled off from the pandemic mania of last year, with retail written orders falling 8.6% compared with last year and wholesale declining 7.2%. But compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the last pre-pandemic first quarter, written orders were up 7.4% and wholesale were down 0.1%.Many are watching the inventory levels at retailers. Ethan Allen's inventories net decreased to $167.7 million as of Sep 30, 2022, compared with $176.5 million as of June 30, 2022 as the company restored its operating inventory levels to more historical norms as backlog declines.Story continuesSpecial Dividend and No DebtEthan Allen is proud of its dedication to its shareholders. It saw strong operating cash flow of $38.4 million during the quarter and returned  $20.9 million to shareholders through cash dividends.It not only paid its standard quarterly dividend, which is currently yielding 4.5%, it also paid a $0.50 special dividend in Aug 2022.Ethan Allen also had no debt outstanding as of Sep 30, 2022.Analysts Raise Full Year EstimatesDespite an uncertain economic environment, and fear of a recession, which will certainly hit furniture retailers, the analysts had apparently gotten too bearish on Ethan Allen.2 estimates were raised for both fiscal 2023 and 2024 in the last 30 days. None were cut.The Fiscal 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $3.54 from $2.95 in the last 30 days. However, that's an earnings decline from last year of 9.9% as Ethan Allen made $3.93.But analysts also raised fiscal 2024 to $3.00 from $2.70 in the last month.While furniture orders may finally be slowing, the analysts were just too pessimistic.Shares Stage a Mini-RallyEthan Allen shares are actually higher on the year, up 9.2%, but that's only thanks to the latest 1-month rally, which saw shares up 28.7%.The Street has not favored Ethan Allen despite its big dividend. Shares are up just 0.4% over the last 5 years compared to the S&amp;P 500 up 50.8% over the same time period.Shares are still cheap, with a forward P/E of 8.For investors looking for a retailer with no debt, a dividend, and where the shares are cheap, Ethan Allen should be on the short list.Bear of the Day:PulteGroup, Inc. is facing a challenging housing market in 2023. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see a big earnings decline next year as housing slows further.PulteGroup is the nation's third largest homebuilder. It operates in 24 states and in over 40 major markets. Its brands include Centex, Pulte, Del Webb, DiVosta, John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods, and American West.Its sales consist of 32% first-time buyers, 43% to move up and 25% active adults. Its Del Webb and DiVosta brands are there to serve the baby boomers as they head towards retirement.An Earnings Miss in the Third QuarterOn Oct 25, 2022, PulteGroup reported its third quarter results and posted a rare earnings miss. Earnings were $2.69 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $2.73, or a $0.04 miss.This was only the second earnings miss in the last 5 years, with the other one in 2021.Revenue was up 16% to $3.8 billion, driven by a 15% increase in the average sales price of homes closed to $545,000, along with a 1% increase in closings to 7,047 homes.Gross margins also rose by 360 basis points year-over-year to 30.1% from 26.5%.Unit backlog totaled 17,053 homes, down 14% from a year ago. The backlog value rose 3% to $10.6 billion.Given the changing market conditions due to rising mortgage rates, PulteGroup elected to terminate a number of pending land transactions and wrote off $24 million of deposits and preacquisition expenses associated with the deals.Analysts Cutting Earnings Estimates for 2022 and 2023PulteGroup's headline report looks solid because they are still delivering out of their big backlog from before rates rose.But analysts have been cutting estimates over the last 30 days.In the last month, 6 estimates were lowered for 2022 which pushed down the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $10.15 from $11.21 90 days ago.That is still earnings growth of 39% compared to 2021, when PulteGroup made $7.30.4 estimates were also cut for 2023, but one was raised in the last month as well. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has plunged to $7.09 from $9.98 in the last 90 days. That's down 30% from 2022's hot market.Value or Value Trap?PulteGroup shares are down 20.3% year-to-date which is worse than the S&amp;P 500, which has fallen 15.8%. But with mortgage rates jumping over 7%, it's not surprising that investors have jumped out of the homebuilder stocks this year.Shares are dirt cheap. PulteGroup has a forward P/E of just 4.3. But with those earnings expected to decline sharply next year, that makes it a value trap.PulteGroup does pay a dividend, which currently yields 1.4%. It also has a share repurchase program. In the third quarter, it repurchased 4.4 million shares, or 2% of its common shares, for $180 million.With mortgage rates remaining elevated, and a possible recession looming, it may be too early to dive back into the homebuilders. Watch the earnings estimates for a turnaround.Additional content:Permian Oil Drilling Rig Count Rises for 6th Week in 10In its weekly release, Baker Hughes Company reported that the U.S. rig count was higher than the prior-week tally.

The figure is higher thanthe prior week's count of 779. Thus, the tally increased in five of the prior six weeks. The current national rig count is higher than the year-ago level of 563.The onshore rigs in the week ended Nov 18 totaled 762, higher than the prior-week count of 758. In offshore resources, 17 rigs were operating, in line with the prior-week count.U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises: Oil rig count was 623 for the week ended Nov 18, higher than the prior week's figure of 622. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is up from the year-ago figure of 461.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Increases: Natural gas rig count of 157 was higher than the prior-week figure of 155. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week's tally of 102. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.2% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 23 units, higher than the prior-week count of 22. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 759 is higher than the prior-week level of 757.Gulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Flat: GoM rig count was 16 units, all oil-directed. The count was flat with the prior-week number.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 345, lower than the prior week's count of 347. However, the tally increased in six of the prior 10 weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $80-per-barrel mark, which is still extremely favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for further rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources and Continental Resources, Inc., as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG will be able to reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Continental Resources is also a leading upstream energy company with proven reserves in North Dakota and Oklahoma. Its oil inventories are among the best in the industry.Headquartered in Oklahoma City, Continental Resources is likely to witness earnings growth of roughly 141% in 2022. The Zacks Rank #3 firm has gained 50% in the past year, outpacing the 35.7% rise of the composite stocks belonging to the industry.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index is down 16% year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite plunged 29%.But you don’t necessarily need a rallying market to make money in stocks — you can also collect dividends.Healthy dividend stocks have the potential to:Offer a plump income stream in both good times and bad times.Provide much-needed diversification to growth-oriented portfolios.Outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the long haul.To be sure, if you want to live 100% off dividends, you should look for more than just the highest-yielding names. Dividends are not carved in stone. When times get tough, dividends can and do get cut.Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger heavy demand for this physical asset — get in now before the super-rich swarmBut some companies have the ability to return generous amounts of cash to investors through thick and thin.Better yet, some companies have consistently raised their dividends over time.Here’s a look at three of them. Wall Street also sees upside in this trio.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.Story continuesMore impressively, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. The stock currently yields 2.8%.UBS analyst Peter Grom has a ‘buy’ rating on Coca-Cola and a price target of $68 — roughly 9% above where the stock sits today.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)When it comes to delivering recession-proof returns, few companies have done a better job than healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson.The stock has been trending up for decades and for good reason. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s business grows consistently through economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted EPS has increased at a steady pace of 8% annually.And that means shareholders can look forward to higher dividends every year.JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford has an ‘outperform’ rating on JNJ and a price target of $185 — around 5% above the current levels.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble has an even longer dividend growth track record than Coca-Cola and Johnson &amp; Johnson: the company has raised its payout to shareholders for 66 consecutive years.That streak is a testament to its entrenched position in the consumer staples market. P&amp;G has a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades and Tide detergent.These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing. As a result, the company can deliver reliable dividends even in tough times.The latest dividend hike was announced in April, when the board of directors approved a 5% increase to the quarterly payout to 91.33 cents per share. The stock currently yields 2.5%.Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy has a ‘buy’ rating on Procter &amp; Gamble and recently raised his price target from $149 to $164. That implies a potential upside of 12%.Looking for a bigger idea?Of course, not every investor needs steady income. Some people want juicier upside — and they want it outside of the stock market.There’s an overlooked ‘passion asset’ that has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 131% over the past 26 years — with lower volatility.According to Forbes, it’s a “compelling option” for those looking to diversify.And Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs says it can “protect purchasing power” when inflation is hot.Investing in this shockproof asset used to be an option only for the ultra-rich.

108,8bc6b6a8-4337-3a67-90e9-9ba89cfcc480,GT,2022-11-26,Goodyear (GT) Appears a Risky Bet for Short-Term Investors,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goodyear-gt-appears-risky-bet-143002159.html,1669386602,STORY,"['GT', 'HOG']","[Tire giant Goodyear Tire GT has been having a rough run on the bourses since quite some time and is unlikely to show any major improvement in the near term. Uncertainty and volatility have been making the operating environment difficult for Goodyear since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shares of the company have plunged 47% on a year-to-date basis, wider than the sector’s decline.In the last reported quarter, the company snapped its earnings beat run. Till the second quarter of 2022, Goodyear had been on a hot earnings streak, chaining together eight consecutive EPS beats. In the third quarter of 2022, Goodyear reported adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. The bottom line also declined 44.4% year over year.During the last reported quarter, the company battled various headwinds, including persistent inflation. Tire volumes were weaker than expected, the industry environment in Europe was tough, and adverse foreign currency translations and cost inflation, including energy, labor and transportation, hurt the bottom line. Discouragingly, the headwinds are not likely to abate anytime soon. In fact, considering the rising energy price in Europe and low volumes, Goodyear now expects cost inflation to peak in the fourth quarter.The company expects commodity costs to be up by about $500 million in the fourth quarter. For the first half of 2023, the company expects year-over-year cost increases of $300-$400 million. The year-on-year effect of other inflationary cost pressure is also expected to persist, driven by energy, transportation and labor costs.Additionally, the firm is making substantial amounts of investment and capital spending in order to develop technologically advanced offerings. It anticipates 2022 capital expenditure in the band of $1-$1.1 billion, higher than $981 million recorded in 2021 on account of upgrades for more complex tire designs and brownfield expansions. Rising capex trends are likely to clip cash flows.Story continuesUnfavorable foreign currency translation is also likely to play spoilsport. The effect of foreign currency exchange impacted last reported quarter’s operating income to the tune of $9 million due to U.S. dollar strength. Goodyear expects continued adverse forex impacts on profits in the near term.While the North America and Asia Pacific segments are still in good shape, Goodyear is witnessing a significantly weaker industry environment in Europe. Low tire volumes and continued inflation, including rising energy costs are impacting the segment’s profitability. In response to softer demand, the company intends to reduce fourth-quarter production in the region. The company also anticipates winter weather conditions to limit fourth-quarter volumes. The segments sales and profits declined year over year in the last reported quarter and we expect the weakness to continue in the near term.Also, the elevated leverage of the firm restricts its financial flexibility. As of Sep 30, 2022, long-term debt and finance leases amounted to $7,839 million, up from $6,648 million on Dec 31, 2021. Notably, Goodyear’s long-term debt-to-capital ratio of 0.60 is higher than the auto sector’s 0.35.While GT might have strong long-term prospects owing to the Cooper Tire buyout and electrification strides, the near-term outlook remains muted. Considering the current pessimism, we believe investors would do better to stay away from this stock now.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings implies a year-over-year decline of 31%. The consensus estimate for EPS has been revised downward by 64 cents in the past 30 days. GT currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.If you wish to invest in the auto space, the following stocks should be on your watchlist.PACCAR PCAR: PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. PCAR's accelerated efforts toward electrification and connected vehicle services are set to boost prospects. PCAR sports a Zacks Rank #1.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s 2022 sales and EPS stands at 21.6% and 53.2% growth each from the respective year-earlier reported numbers. PCAR has a Value Score of B. The stock’s earnings exceeded estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 12.6%.Harley-Davidson HOG: One of the leading motorcycle makers in the world, Harley-Davidson is currently focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with the market trends. HOG's Hardwire plans look to improve effectiveness and contribute to revenue growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Harley-Davidson’s 2022 sales and EPS is pegged at 7.5% and 12.4% growth each from the respective year-ago reported figures.

109,0932839b-7d21-3a58-aa0e-7a82f7751aa6,MOS,2022-11-26,14 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-best-agriculture-stocks-buy-145036673.html,1669387836,STORY,"['ADM', 'CNHI', 'FMC', 'MOS', 'LW', 'CALM', 'SMG', 'INGR', 'DAR', 'CTVA']","[In this article, we will be looking at the 14 best agriculture stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the agriculture sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development forecasts a 15% increase in global demand for agricultural output over the next ten years, which will be met by improved agricultural methods used by producers everywhere. The agricultural sector significantly impacts several regional, national, and international economic sectors. It accounts for 4% of the global GDP and more than 25% of GDP in developing countries. Understanding what is happening in this sector and how it will impact food production and distribution is crucial for everyone, from farmers and real estate investors to supermarkets and dining establishments.After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, several significant uncertainties make it hard to forecast the future prognosis for any business precisely. Because of the close ties between the energy and fertilizer sectors, this might have an impact on global agriculture suppliers. Russian exports of potash, ammonia, urea and other organic fertilizers have been significantly hampered due to Western sanctions on the country. Farmers worldwide are using less fertilizer and growing fewer crops due to the exorbitant fertilizer expenses.As of November 15, 2022, the world's population reached 8 billion, three times that in 1950. There will be 8.5 billion people on the planet by 2030, 9.7 billion by 2050, and 10.4 billion by the end of the century. Therefore, to fulfil the increasing food demand in 2050, global agriculture production must grow by about 50% from the present levels. The challenge for farmers, governments, and scientists is to increase food production without accelerating environmental deterioration and the climatic problem. AI-powered solutions that improve crop quality, quantity, and market entry time can help farmers become more productive.Story continuesPhoto by Sebastian Gómez on UnsplashPrecision agriculture, often known as artificial intelligence systems, is assisting in enhancing the overall quality and accuracy of harvests. The potential that artificial intelligence (AI) offers for the interpretation of satellite imagery for field surveillance is one of the most effective uses of AI in agriculture. This technology makes the identification of pests, plant diseases, and undernutrition of farms easier. Prior to choosing which herbicide should be used in the region, artificial intelligence (AI) sensors may recognize and target weeds. Herbicide use is reduced, as a result, lowering expenses. Furthermore, employing AI-based robots for agricultural harvesting aids in managing the labor shortage. AI also makes smart decisions, such as optimal plant time, crop yields, and forecasting prices. Robots have been created by businesses like Harvest Automation and Nexus Robotics for picking fragile food and pulling weeds, respectively. These trends, combined or used in any combination, will impact every aspect of the agriculture industry. The global AI in agriculture market was worth USD 1.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 25.1% to reach USD 4.2 billion by 2028.Agribusiness is currently in high demand. Due to the size required for operations, a few industry giants like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) control the bulk of the market share. As a result, these agricultural equities are in the limelight and appear poised for long-term success.Our MethodologyIn order to identify the best agriculture stocks to buy now, we first started with the 189 positions in iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers ETF (VEGI). VEGI invests in global agriculture stocks that have exposure to ""companies that produce fertilizers and agricultural chemicals, farm machinery, and packaged foods, and meats"". We then used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of hedge fund sentiment scores to rank these stocks based on their popularity among the 920 hedge funds that recently reported their 13F portfolios.Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now14.

(NASDAQ:CALM). Here is what the fund:“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) and WESCO International. Tight hen supply tied to a bird flu outbreak has supported higher egg prices, a key driver for egg-producer Cal-Maine’s profitability. Outside of that exogenous event, Cal-Maine is well positioned amid an industry shift to cage-free eggs. Cal-Maine invested ahead of competitors in upgrading facilities — spending on its upgrades when inflation was lower — which we believe should prove an additional boon enabling ongoing share gains.”13.

Many investors believe that uncertainty will prevail as inflation is not going away anytime soon. Being inherently volatile in nature, the global uncertain business scenario has further induced choppiness in overall energy operations, which is getting reflected in the oil price chart.Companies belonging to the energy sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP DCP and The Williams Companies Inc WMB, while keeping an eye on MPLX LP MPLX.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks belonging to midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably less exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space. One stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), one carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and one has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, the #2 Ranked MPLX announced that as of third-quarter 2022-end, it had roughly $1 billion available under its unit repurchase authorizations.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this real estate investment trust is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 5.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 19.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.9%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 39.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 14.9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Mid-America Apartment Communities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.8% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Mid-America Apartment Communities a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Mid-America Apartment Communities is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Cigna's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Cigna How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:15% = US$6.7b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.15 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Cigna's Earnings Growth And 15% ROETo begin with, Cigna seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. This probably goes some way in explaining Cigna's significant 23% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 16%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Cigna Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cigna's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.3%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits.

115,bcdaebc7-6e97-386b-a530-9b15974ccf7e,NKE,2022-11-26,UPDATE 1-Shares of Nike and Adidas could score at the World Cup,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-shares-nike-adidas-could-173050365.html,1669397450,STORY,"['ADS.DE', 'NKE', 'PUMSY']","[(Updates stock moves, details on standings, comment from Adidas) By Noel Randewich Nov 25 (Reuters) - As 32 teams compete for the World Cup in Qatar, Adidas and Nike also hope their shares can score. With FIFA projecting at least 5 billion TV viewers, the world's highest profile soccer event is a major opportunity for sports apparel makers marketing their jerseys, boots and other products with teams and individual players. Adidas shares lost 6% during the month-long 2018 World Cup, when heavily favored Germany, an Adidas team, was knocked out early and the FIFA tournament was won by France, a Nike team. Nike gained 4% during the same period, beating the S&amp;P 500's 1% gain. In its quarterly conference call on Nov. 9, Adidas said it expects sales of about 400 euros ($415 million) related to the World Cup, which would amount to around 2% of additional annual revenue. Mexico jerseys are among Adidas' current best sellers, an Adidas spokesperson said. Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the importance of the World Cup on its sales. While soccer-related merchandise accounts for a fraction of both Adidas and Nike's overall businesses, hype around the World Cup and team jerseys can provide a halo effect driving sales of other kinds of merchandise, said Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic. ""If somebody in Germany buys a World Cup jersey, do they also buy a new pair shoes? Or if an Adidas sponsored team wins the whole thing, in the euphoria of winning the World Cup, do people buy more jerseys than they otherwise would have? That's where you can see some variability,"" Nikic said. Nike is providing jerseys for 13 teams in this World Cup, including Brazil, France and the United States, overtaking Adidas as the leader in World Cup jerseys. Seven teams are kitted out in Adidas jerseys, including powerhouses Germany, Spain and Argentina. Six countries are playing in Puma jerseys, with New Balance and other companies making up the remainder. Nearly a week into the World Cup, Nike teams have accumulated 22 points, while Adidas-clad teams have accumulated 11 points and teams wearing Puma jerseys have won eight points. So far during the tournament, shares of Nike have risen under 1%, while Adidas and Puma are each down 3.8% and 3.0% respectively. Betting odds favor Nike-wearing Brazil as most likely to win the 2022 Cup.

(VFC) Up 23.1% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-vfc-23-1-163104237.html,1669393864,STORY,['VFC'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for V.F. (VFC). Shares have added about 23.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is V.F. due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.V.F. Corp Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates, Sales Fall Y/YV.F. Corp reported soft second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and bottom lines missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining from the year-ago quarter’s readings. Results were hurt by a tough operating environment, including the COVID-related disruption in China, macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds, and the near-term challenges at Vans.Nonetheless, the resiliency of VFC’s brand portfolio and strength in the outdoor, active, streetwear and workwear units are tailwinds.Q2 HighlightsV.F. Corp’s adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents declined 34% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, adjusted earnings per share were down 27%.Net revenues of $3,080.6 million dipped 4% year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,103 million. At cc, revenues were up 2%. The top line gained from growth in the EMEA and APAC regions, partly offset by lower sales in the Americas region. Revenues of the company’s big four brands were down 5% (up 1% at cc), while the rest of the portfolio increased 4% (up 13% at cc).VFC’s Outdoor emerging brands in aggregate rose 14% on solid growth at Ultra, registering a double-digit growth rate in road running and trail running. Ultra grew in mid-teens in the Americas and triple-digits in EMEA. Globally, both wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses recorded low single-digit growth in the quarter. Four of VFC’s five largest markets posted sturdy double-digit growth.Revenues in the Americas were down 3% year over year on a reported basis and 3% at cc. In the EMEA region, revenues dipped 4% (up 12% at cc). APAC revenues decreased 6% on a reported basis (up 2% at cc), whereas revenues in Greater China fell 15% (down 10% at cc). V.F. Corp’s international revenues slipped 5% year over year on a reported basis (up 8% at cc).Channel-wise, wholesale revenues were down 4% (up 3% at cc) year over year. In the direct-to-consumer channel, revenues declined 4% (down 1% at cc). The digital channel witnessed a revenue decline of 7% and 1% on a reported and cc basis, respectively.Gross margin decreased 230 basis points (bps) to 51.4%, mainly driven by increased costs and promotional activity, partly offset by price increases. On an adjusted basis, gross margin decreased 240 bps to 51.5%.Adjusted operating income decreased 29.1% year over year to $378.7 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted 440 bps to 12.3% due to lower gross margin.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRevenues in the Outdoor segment rose 3% to $1,555.3 million (up 10% at cc). The Active segment reported revenues of $1,260.1 million, down 9% (down 4% at cc) year over year. Revenues in the Work segment fell 11% year over year (down 9% at cc) to $265.2 million.Financial DetailsV.F. Corp ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $552.8 million, long-term debt of $3,526.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $3,085.6 million. Inventories were up 88% year over year, amounting to $2,749.9 million.For the six months ended September 2022, VFC used an operating cash flow of $914 million from the continuing operations. V.F. Corp returned $194 million to its shareholders through dividend payouts in the fiscal second quarter and $388 million in the first half. VFC declared a quarterly cash dividend of 51 cents per share, reflecting a 2% rise from the prior quarter’s dividend. This will be payable Dec 20, 2022, to its shareholders of record as of Dec 12.Other UpdatesV.F. Corp continues to adjust its business operations per the government guidelines associated with COVID-19. Most of its supply chain is operational at present. Although its raw material suppliers across China are currently operational, it saw an eight-week lockdown in China during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This led to logistics-related issues causing ongoing product delays. VFC is working with its suppliers to minimize disruptions. Its distribution centers are operating in accordance with the government guidelines to maintain safety and health protocols.All stores in North America and EMEA regions remained open during the reported quarter. In the APAC region, including Mainland China, no stores were shut at the start of the quarter with a peak of 7% stores (including partner doors) closed and an average of 3% of stores shuttered throughout the reported quarter. At the end of the reported quarter, 4% of stores were shut and currently 7% of stores are closed.OutlookFor fiscal 2023, VFC is reaffirming its constant dollar revenue growth of 5-6%. It expects 6.5 points of impact from foreign currency fluctuations on reported revenues. Management expects North Face to grow at least 12%. Vans for will be down in the mid-single digits the fiscal year.With a more impactful promotional landscape, reflecting the increased levels of inventory across the marketplace and the US dollar strengthening, VFC forecasts a year-over-year gross margin decline of 100-150 bps compared with the prior stated decline of 50 bps. Lower gross margin and higher foreign currency woes induce a fall of nearly 11% in the adjusted operating margin guidance, down from the earlier mentioned 12%.V.F. Corp envisions earnings per share of $2.40-$2.50 compared with the $2.60-$2.70 stated earlier. Earnings per share of $3.18 were recorded last year. Management noted that VFC’s balance sheet remains sound, with liquidity likely to exceed $2.3 billion by the year-end.Adjusted cash flow from operations is likely to be $0.9 billion for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditure is expected to be $230 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -10.13% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, V.F. has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise V.F. has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

118,25fa7bed-1d7a-31a1-91de-f05bab2be4e7,WFC,2022-11-26,"With 74% institutional ownership, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-institutional-ownership-wells-fargo-140017929.html,1669384817,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[If you want to know who really controls Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wells Fargo. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Wells Fargo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Wells Fargo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. With 6.9% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$136m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wells Fargo. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Wells Fargo is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

119,b9f5832e-2d3b-3328-9b9a-3ec79fe53f3f,PFE,2022-11-26,25 Countries with Highest Life Expectancy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-countries-highest-life-expectancy-132016581.html,1669468816,STORY,"['PFE', 'GSK']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 countries with highest life expectancy. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 10 Countries with Highest Life Expectancy.In just the past two decades, 2000 — 2019, the average global life expectancy increased from 66.8 years to 73.4 years while healthy life expectancy has also improved by 8% over the same period.This is the result of tens of billions of dollars spent on research and development by the top drug companies in the world. For example, GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) developed a vaccine which is the only vaccine approved against malaria by the World Health Organization showing a 77% efficiency rate. GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) also recently announced that the European Medicines Agency validated the marketing authorization application for its groundbreaking RSV vaccine to protect the population against respiratory syncytial virus, which is something Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also engaged in. Speaking of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), pharmaceutical companies were absolutely integral in saving us from the disastrous effects of the pandemic as treatment and vaccines made by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), in addition to AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), were available for negligible costs for the masses all over the world.However, life expectancy is not equal in most countries. Many developing economies do not have the resources or technical capability to provide sufficient health resources to its population. Most developed economies in the world have free healthcare for everyone, with surprisingly, the U.S. being the only such country to not provide socialized healthcare which is especially surprising considering how some of the biggest pharma companies are headquartered there. This is why the U.S. doesn't even make the list of the countries with the highest life expectancy, with an average life expectancy of around 71 years, around 10 years short of the country that ranks the lowest on our list.Story continuesOn the other hand, you will find many European countries on our list, mainly because these governments and the European Union enact policies and regulations for the benefit of their citizens.You won't find any developing country in the list of countries with highest life expectancy because of the aforementioned lack of healthcare facilities, in addition to other issues such as lack of safety, high crime and high levels of pollution.To determine our list, we headed over to the United Nations website and consulted their database. We then ranked each country based on its life expectancy in both 2020 and 2021. So, without further ado, let's take a look at countries where people live long, healthy lives starting with number 25:25. CyprusTotal life expectancy of both sexes at birth for 2020 (in years): 81.4Total life expectancy of both sexes at birth for 2021 (in years): 81.2Cypriots are known for their consumption of the Mediterranean diet which includes fruits, vegetables, fish and olive oil.

Healthcare experts believe that the virus is here to stay for the foreseeable future, and the new normal will vary for every individual. As of June 30, 2022, there have been more than 87 million reported cases of COVID-19 in the United States, and despite the large variety of vaccines, booster shots, and antibody drugs available in the market, many Americans refuse to inoculate themselves against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the COVID-19 virus is now less lethal than it was in 2020, it is widespread, and Europe and the United States have reached the endemic stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as per McKinsey. The winter of 2022 and 2023 may see a more increase in reported COVID patients in the Northern Hemisphere, yet it won’t be as significant as the December 2021–February 2022 wave.As the risk of the pandemic has not completely died down, investors might still benefit from the leading companies which made record-breaking sales during COVID-induced lockdowns.Our Methodology For this article we scanned the database Insider Monkey tracking 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 11 stocks that benefited greatly from the pandemic and are still positioned to profit from any possible pandemic situation in the future. Some of these companies are working on COVID treatments and vaccines while others see a huge demand of their products and services during lockdowns caused by COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemics.Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashBest COVID Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11.

The analyst said the Neutral rating balances the advantages of the company's ""solid"" positioning in multiple rapidly advancing medical technology markets and ""fortress"" balance sheet against COVID testing and infant formula recall/relaunch headwinds. He sees this dynamic continuing over the next numerous quarters ""which will now coincide with recession uncertainties.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 62 hedge funds were long Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management featured as the leading position holder in the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Like Netflix, Inc.

Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”10.

The company offers its products under the Rockstar Games, 2K, Private Division, and T2 Mobile Games brands. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)’s fiscal year 2020 revenue grew 16% to $3.089 billion, as compared to $2.668 billion in fiscal 2019.On November 17, Truist analyst Matthew Thornton maintained a Buy rating on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

Take-Two has a reputation for the high quality of its games, having published industry favorites such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA2K.The video game industry itself has shed much of its boom-and-bust patterns to become a steadier, more predictable business with high barriers to entry, established title franchises, and high levels of recurring, in-game revenue streams. The company has been investing heavily to step up the number of new title launches over the next few years, a favorable set-up which we believe is not fully reflected in its stock price.”9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the biggest American retailers.

All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment.

D E Shaw held a notable stake in the company, comprising 1.10 million shares worth $521.7 million. Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”7. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an American company that discovers, develops, and markets human pharmaceuticals worldwide.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company. It is one of the best COVID stocks to monitor.

The new company could look for ways to integrate its media properties. It could also explore ways to use the company’s assets for emerging business lines, such as sports betting, for which Fox has already received a green signal in buying a stake at Fanduel. The merged companies could potentially save money by hiring one management team and maintaining one set of relationships with vendors, the people said.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe advantage that Fox could draw from the merger would be to diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue to its top line.The publishing wing of Murdoch’s empire, News Corp, has been performing better than expected. The Journal.ie, part of its Dow Jones unit, enjoyed robust growth in its digital-subscription business over the past few years. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 9% year over year.The digital real-estate unit and book-publishing business have also propelled growth. Revenues in the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 7% year over year to $443 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Shares of Fox Corp and News corp have declined 15.8% and 18.3% respectively year to date, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which fell 33.5%.Despite such tailwinds, the merger could only be carried out successfully if the major shareholders of both companies are in support of it.Concerns such as the redundant print-advertising model of News Corp, its reliance on countries outside the United States for the majority of its revenues during the ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength have to be addressed to the investors.Story continuesZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider.Fox Corp currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Liberty Media FWONK and Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This is because a sizable number of US lawmakers engage in stock trading. Until the past few years, making large amounts of money from these trades was considered a side-benefit of winning a seat in the US Congress. In order to make these trades more transparent, the STOCK Act of April 2012 was passed, requiring lawmakers to disclose their stock trading through a Periodic Transaction Report within 45 days of the transaction.  Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since 2019, is one of the most active stock traders in the US Congress. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, runs a venture capital firm. Some of the top stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio include prominent names like Amazon.com, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) got significantly more attention from both institutional &amp; retail investors after Facebook announced to rename itself as Meta Platforms. I believe the price appreciation is largely attributed to the increased attention. On the business side, Roblox rolled out a few successful music events and also partnered with Netflix on testing long-form media consumption in the virtual world. Apple in its iOS 14.5 rolled out an impactful change for the digital advertising landscape by requiring all apps to ask users to “opt-in”.10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68   American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provides charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services.

Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise amid a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”9. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. It is one of the premier stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio. On October 21, Micron Technology noted that it had signed a license and settlement agreement with subsidiaries of Wi-LAN.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.1 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $355 from $390, noting that the company reported a Q3 earnings miss compared to expectations, with mostly in-line revenue but weaker gross margins, and is still positioned to deliver a record Q4 as its factories continue to scale globally.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.3 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic; second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)7.

Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)” 6.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $120, noting that given the increasing likelihood that the US and global economies will enter recession, the advisory was now assuming a modest economic downturn in 2023 forecasts.In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Mayar Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter, we bought shares in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the payments platform. PayPal has been one of the more high-profile victims of the market’s brutal ruthlessness over the past few months, and the stock fell by over two-thirds between its peak in July to the beginning of March this year. As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.We also note that MPC holds a PEG ratio of 0.31. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.48. Over the last 12 months, MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.53 and as low as 0.25, with a median of 0.56.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MPC's P/B ratio of 1.79. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. MPC's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.11. Within the past 52 weeks, MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.07, with a median of 1.50.Finally, investors should note that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 4.06. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 5.30. Over the past year, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 2.96, with a median of 3.66.Story continuesThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Marathon Petroleum is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, MPC feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

136,c75a0942-92c4-3dac-8475-572e4f96f452,MPC,2022-11-26,Time to Get Bullish on These 4 Refining & Marketing Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-bullish-4-refining-marketing-133301068.html,1669383181,STORY,"['PBF', 'PSX', 'MPC', 'MUSA', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry continues to benefit from strength in fundamentals, strong margins and robust fuel demand. As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, the downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, reefing and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Murphy USA MUSA and PBF Energy PBF have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products’ terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSrong Refined Products Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products’ consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 4% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid the post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2022. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Attractive Margins: The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs earlier this year. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high. Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Higher Costs &amp; Inflationary Pressures: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners’ ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers. Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What’s worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. While the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have increased 159.7% in the past year, the same for 2023 have risen 143.2% over the same timeframe.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 45% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 31.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 15.8%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.35X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.22X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.39X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.67X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years)  4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMarathon Petroleum: Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase Molson Coors Beverage's shares on or after the 1st of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.38 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.52 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Molson Coors Beverage stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of $55.58. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Molson Coors Beverage is paying out an acceptable 65% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 44% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Molson Coors Beverage's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Molson Coors Beverage's earnings per share have dropped 21% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Molson Coors Beverage has increased its dividend at approximately 1.7% a year on average.To Sum It UpIs Molson Coors Beverage an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We're not enthused by the declining earnings per share, although at least the company's payout ratio is within a reasonable range, meaning it may not be at imminent risk of a dividend cut. To summarise, Molson Coors Beverage looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.However if you're still interested in Molson Coors Beverage as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with Molson Coors Beverage. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for Molson Coors Beverage that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

139,994b23cb-42d5-3225-9964-4b0c5da7140f,AES,2022-11-26,Estimating The Fair Value Of The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-aes-corporation-165359923.html,1669395239,STORY,"['AES', 'AESC']","[Does the November share price for The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for AES The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$593.0mUS$690.3mUS$916.0mUS$1.02bUS$1.10bUS$1.16bUS$1.22bUS$1.26bUS$1.30bUS$1.34bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.52%Est @ 5.86%Est @ 4.69%Est @ 3.88%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.91% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$557US$608US$758US$792US$799US$794US$780US$761US$738US$713(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.3bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$23b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$28.5, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at AES as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.888. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For AES, there are three additional items you should explore:Risks: Take risks, for example - AES has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does AES's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Shares have added about 7.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ford Motor Company due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Ford Q3 Earnings Decline, Revenues Up Y/YFord reported adjusted earnings of 30 cents per share in third-quarter 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Lower-than-expected profits in its North America segment and plummeting revenues and a widening pretax loss in the China unit led to this downslide.  The bottom line declined 41.2% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 51 cents. The company’s consolidated third-quarter revenues came in at $39.4 billion, rising 10% year over year.Segmental PerformanceIn the third quarter, the total wholesale volume in the Ford Automotive segment increased 7% year over year to 1,086,000 units but missed the consensus metric of 1,132,000 units. Revenues from the segment increased 12% to $37.2 billion but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.6 billion. Earnings before interest and taxes came in at $1,698 million, declining from the year-ago EBIT of $2,459 million and missing the consensus metric of $2,111 million.In North America, revenues grew 10% year over year to $26.3 billion in the reported quarter but fell short of the consensus metric of $27.6 billion. The wholesale volume rose 4% to 568,000 units but lagged the consensus metric of 627,000 units. EBIT totaled $1,309 million, a decrease from $2,423 million in the corresponding quarter of 2021. The figure also missed the consensus mark of $1,955 million.In South America, revenues moved up 41% year over year to $0.9 billion in the quarter and topped the consensus mark of $0.87 billion. Wholesale volume increased 17% to 23,000 units. The figure, however, lagged the consensus mark of 27,510 units. The unit’s pretax earnings came in at $149 million, increasing massively from $2 million in the prior-year quarter benefiting from restructuring efforts. It also crossed the consensus mark of $96 million.Story continuesIn Europe, revenues jumped 11% year over year to $6.8 billion in the quarter and crossed the consensus mark of $6.52 billion. Wholesale volume increased 25% to 273,000 units and beat the consensus mark of 252,000 units. Pretax earnings for the segment totaled $204 million, reversing from the year-ago loss of $52 million. The EBIT far exceeded the consensus mark of $11.4 million.In China, revenues nosedived 27% year over year to $0.4 billion in the reported quarter and lagged the consensus mark of $0.72 billion. Wholesale volume also fell 16% to 137,000 units and missed the consensus metric of 138,000 units. The pretax loss widened from the prior year’s loss of $39 million to $193 million. The loss was wider than the consensus mark of a loss of $64 million.In the International Markets Group, revenues soared 47% from the year-ago figure to $2.8 billion and topped the consensus mark of $2.63 billion. Wholesale volume rose 30% to 86,000 units but lagged the consensus metric of 88,000 units. Pretax earnings totaled $229 million, rising from $125 million reported in the year-ago period and crossing the consensus metric of $113 million.Third-quarter revenues from the Ford Credit unit came in at $2,187 million, 10% lower than the year-ago revenues of $2,434 million and missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,314 million. Pretax earnings totaled $599 million, falling from $1,077 million in the year-ago quarter and lagging the consensus mark of $770 million.Revenues from Ford Mobility came in at $11 million, steeply declining from the year-earlier level of $38 million and grossly missing the consensus estimate of $58 million.Financial PositionFord reported adjusted free cash flow (FCF) of $3,601 million during the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 billion as of Sep 30, 2022, compared with $20.5 billion on Dec 31, 2021. The automotive long-term debt increased to $19,073 million from $17,200 million as of the end of 2021. Riding on its financial strength, Ford announced a dividend of 15 cents per share. The dividend is payable on Dec 1 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Nov 15. Ford is resuming a modest share repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation and approved the repurchase of up to 35 million shares over time for that cause.GuidanceFord’s 2022 projections have been revised. Adjusted EBIT for 2022 is now estimated to be around $11.5 billion instead of the prior guided range of $11.5-$12.5 billion. Adjusted FCF is envisioned in the range of $9.5 billion-$10 billion for 2022, up from the prior range of $5.5-6.5 billion. The company’s assumption of growth of 10% to 15% in vehicle wholesale volumes for 2022 remains the same. However, it anticipates headwinds from commodity prices and other inflationary costs to the tune of $9 billion for 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Ford Motor Company has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

142,12a281f7-fcbe-3007-b49f-d5daa8700b98,GM,2022-11-26,7 Stocks to Bet On if You Need Fast Cash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-bet-fast-cash-200101588.html,1669147261,STORY,"['LPX', 'WSM', 'BHP', 'GM', 'SIG', 'PBR-A']","[For those seeking fast money stocks, most of 2022 has been a veritable nightmare. With an influx of severe headwinds – particularly soaring inflation and geopolitical flashpoints – the equities sector represented a value trap. Few traders outside of those placing short bets enjoyed the volatility of the year so far. However, with much of the bad news baked in, it’s possible that certain undervalued fast money stocks can bounce back. Under this context, I’m seeking high-momentum names (or those that own the potential to engineer such momentum) for speculators in a hurry.CCitigroup$49.20BHPBHP Group$58.42PBRPetrobras$9.82GMGeneral Motors$39.95LPXLouisiana-Pacific$64,30WSMWilliams-Sonoma$123.25SIGSignet Jewelers$64.88Citigroup (C)The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest financial institutions in the world, Citigroup (NYSE:C) wouldn’t ordinarily qualify as one of the fast money stocks to buy. However, these are no ordinary times. With inflation reaching historic highs combined with geopolitical flashpoints, most equities sectors plunged this year. However, the financial sector appears to have garnered positive momentum, drawing attention to C stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSpecifically, Citigroup shares gained slightly over 10% in the trailing month since the close of the Nov. 21 session. However, on a year-to-date basis, C stock still finds itself down 22.5%, possibly suggesting greater room for growth. To be fair, the narrative is a speculative one. Essentially, with the Federal Reserve still committed to a hawkish monetary policy, subsequent economic weaknesses could hurt banking firms.Nevertheless, contrarians will almost surely find C attractive. Currently, shares trade for just under 7-times forward earnings. In contrast, the forward price-earnings ratio for the banking industry is 8.6 times, implying that C is undervalued.BHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockStory continuesBased in Australia, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is a metals and mining powerhouse. Its vast portfolio also includes natural gas and petroleum products, making it exceptionally relevant. Certainly, with Russia effectively blackmailing western nations with its hydrocarbon energy outflow cuts, more countries will rely on friendly jurisdictions like Australia.Another factor that bolsters BHP centers on its relevancies for the industries of tomorrow. With the company producing copper and nickel among other key commodities, BHP will likely undergird the future of mobility; in other words, electric vehicle production. At the moment, BHP enjoys significantly positive momentum. In the trailing month, shares gained nearly 17% of equity value. Since the start of the year, BHP is up a little over 6%, reflecting one of the few publicly traded securities in the black. Still, BHP trades for only 7-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings. In contrast, the sector median PE ratio is nearly 12 times. Therefore, BHP is worth a look regarding fast money stocks to buy.Petrobras (PBR)Petrobras distributor in the industry and supply sector.. PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comOne of the more compelling albeit riskier wagers in the global hydrocarbon sector, Brazil’s Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) gained just over 2% of equity value since the start of this year. Compared to other hydrocarbon players, that’s a rather disappointing performance. Still, those with a contrarian mindset regarding fast money stocks to buy should give another look at PBR. Specifically, PBR ranked among the highlights for unusual options activity for the session ended Nov. 21. Traders bid up multiple long call options with far expiration dates. For instance, the $8 calls with an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025 stands 787 days away from expiration since the order was placed. Despite the Fed’s intentions to control inflation, many traders view the macroeconomic backdrop as net positive for PBR stock.It’s hard to disagree. Corporate surveys (domestically) indicate that 90% of companies intend to resume in-office operations by 2023. Should other nations follow suit, Petrobras’ total addressable market will rise. Thus, PBR represents one of the fast money stocks to buy.General Motors (GM)General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logoSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.comOver the past several decades, American automakers became the butt of jokes due to their poor quality. However, in recent years, Detroit began seriously flexing its muscles. A clear example stems from General Motors (NYSE:GM). With the introduction of the eighth-generation Corvette along with the electrification of its several popular brands, GM offers a balanced approach to the future of mobility.Essentially, the automaker will cater to two distinct consumer bases until it’s no longer viable to do so. For right now, robust demand for the Corvette reveals that gearheads will continue to command a strong presence. However, GM will not let its EV segment slide. For instance, a popular pizza chain just secured a deal to buy EV fleets from GM. Fortunately for those seeking fast money stocks to buy, the fundamentals have translated to positive chart performance. Over the trailing month, GM shares gained almost 11% of equity value. As well, let’s not forget that GM is incredibly undervalued. Currently, shares trade at 6.3-times forward earnings, ranking favorably below 80% of the competition.Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)Businessman is drawing a growing virtual hologram stock bar chart on dark blue background representing value stocksSource: Costello77 / ShutterstockAnother unusual name for fast money stocks to buy, Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) is an American building materials manufacturer. Unfortunately, with the broader economy suffering from recessionary fears throughout 2022, LPX struggled. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20% of equity value. This performance is actually a bit worse than the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.Still, LPX may benefit from political initiative such as the so-called Build Back Better bill. With Washington focused on restoring American infrastructure following the coronavirus disaster, LPX may become a downwind beneficiary. Certainly, it appears that investors received the memo. In the trailing month, shares gained over 11% of market value. Further, the political impetus could make LPX a long-term idea, not just for fast money stocks.Finally, Louisiana-Pacific will likely court additional investors because of its value proposition. Currently, shares trade at 4-times TTM earnings. In contrast, the sector median PE ratio is a lofty 13 times. As well, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet, strong revenue trends and outstanding profitability metrics.Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Concept image of a person using a smart home app.A consumer retail firm that sells kitchenware and home furnishings, Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is a higher-risk name among fast money stocks. Just look at the consumer sentiment index, which presently trends near historic lows. Unless this index swings higher, the presumption is that WSM will struggle. Certainly, shares fell over 29% YTD, reflecting deep concerns. So, why mention WSM at all as one of the fast money stocks to buy? The thing is, Williams-Sonoma doesn’t cater to your regular consumer base. Rather, the company’s pricey products attract higher-income crowds. And the reality of the post-pandemic new normal dictates that affluent segment made off like bandits. Stated differently, WSM enables investors to cynically bank on trends associated with the widening wealth gap.Furthermore, Williams-Sonoma brings an attractive value proposition to the table. The company enjoys a solid balance sheet and outstanding revenue and profit margins. Even with these attributes, WSM trades at only 7.6-times forward earnings. This compares with the industry median forward PE ratio of 14.2 times.Signet Jewelers (SIG)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockPersonally, if I had to pick a name among fast money stocks to buy, I’d probably go with the first six names. However, those that truly want to bank on the wealth gap phenomenon can target Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG). To be clear, SIG dropped nearly 33% of equity value since the start of this year. However, in the trailing six months, SIG gained almost 14%, reflecting budding enthusiasm.Also, Signet plays into social trends following the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic. As many research papers and journalistic reports indicated, social isolation represented a huge problem during the worst of the crisis. Now that the broader ecosystem is normalizing, it’s an opportunity for folks to reconnect. And you never know – this circumstance may have sparked pent-up demand for marriages, which would bode well for SIG stock.On a final note, those that want to take the plunge should note that Signet also offers an attractive value proposition. Currently, SIG trades at 5.4-times forward earnings, which ranks below nearly 93% of the competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

144,172abd51-4d27-38de-8ab5-6cf571996789,PNC,2022-11-26,"Great week for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) institutional investors after losing 13% over the previous year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-week-pnc-financial-services-130046894.html,1669467646,STORY,['PNC'],"[Every investor in The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 13% losses, last week’s 4.0% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PNC Financial Services Group. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PNC Financial Services Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PNC Financial Services Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PNC Financial Services Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PNC Financial Services Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.6% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$230m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Target The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TargetThe insider, Robert Harrison, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$453k worth of shares at a price of US$218 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$163. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Target didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Target insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$168m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Target Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Target, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Target (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable).If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Snap back to reality and what do we really think of? Most likely, shopping at a superstore called Target.Retirement at Any Age: Get Retirement Tips That Fit Every Stage of LifeRead More: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000While those employees inside might not be Santa’s elves, they do work incredibly hard, especially around the most wonderful time of the year. In fact, Target employees have a few tips to share with customers to make the holiday shopping experience as smooth as possible for you and them.1. Make a List and Check It TwiceConsumer deals are the foundation that Target was built on as a company. That’s the whole point of the giant retailer. But with families tightening their budgets these days, you don’t want to go to Target without a plan in hand and get blindsided into spending more than you intended. “The biggest mistake I see people make when shopping at Target during the holidays is falling for a deal they didn’t already have in mind,” said Derek Hales, a former Target worker and now the founder of ModernCastle.com.The best course of action is to make a list, revise it a few times, then double-check the prices, potential discounts, and the number of items your heart is set on purchasing. That way, you get all your shopping done and won’t find a lump of coal in your bank account when it’s all over.2. Always Check Online FirstPull out your phone, go to the app store, and if you haven’t already, download the Target app. Like many apps, Target allows you to stay up-to-date with the best deals and discounts which you might not find in the brick-and-mortar stores. According to Target employee Kaitlin Sondae on her TikTok for Target hacks, depending on where you live you might find mark offs on items online that are better than if you went to a store in person.Story continuesTake Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?Plus, the Target Circle option in the app allows customers to earn 1% back on all purchases made, even if they don’t have a Target REDCard. It also pays to follow Target on Twitter for all updates from the company. You never know when a surprise sale or free shipping might happen.3. The Price Is Right…For MatchingThis is technically a year round practice at Target, but you can utilize it to your advantage during the holiday season. Price matching is the gift that Target keeps on giving to its customers. Their site officially outlines the holiday price matching policy as “​​Starting October 6, 2022, if you purchase an item in store or online and the price goes lower at Target on or before December 24, 2022, you can request a price match.”“Definitely ask about price matching if you find a product cheaper at another store,” said Steven H., a former Target employee told Reader’s Digest. “It may vary by store, but I know at the one I worked at, we were encouraged to price match to the best of our ability. Obviously, this doesn’t work for Black Friday or Cyber Monday when the deals are at their greatest but bring it up during any other sales period and you might be pleasantly surprised.”4. After Holiday DiscountsOf course, the holidays happen at the same time every year, but what about next year? Have you gotten a jump start on your holiday shopping for 2023? If not, consider the savings you might be able to pocket after Christmas has concluded.Stocking up on wrapping paper from December 26th through January 5th is almost a no brainer, but you can find markdowns on all clothes, electronics, homeware, and accessories that will stay fresh for the upcoming round of gift giving in the year or years to come. To top it all off, if you go to Target in the middle of January through the middle of July, you’ll find the best discounts on toys, which are often the hottest and hardest items to buy the closer you get to Christmas.5. Return Policy Like No OtherDid your gifts not go over as you planned? No need to bah humbug! Target’s return policy is truly fantastic. While the company’s site outlines the standard return policy as, “most unopened items sold by Target in new condition and returned within 90 days will receive a refund or exchange,” some brands like Threshold, up &amp; up, and Mossimo might give you up to one full year to return them.As Target employee Miss Rhae explains on her TikTok for Target hacks a brand such as Cat &amp; Jack has “365 days to return it with any issues. No problems, no questions asked. You can return it for what you paid for it.” Just make sure you have your proof of purchase, such as your physical receipt, Target app, or REDCard.6. Pays To Be Nice Rather Than NaughtyThe most important thing Target employees wish customers knew: being kind will probably be the key to your holiday shopping success. Target employees have to do a lot of work. From being trained in cleaning up biohazards to responding to customer needs in a 15-second timeframe –all of these tasks can ramp up for the end-of-year gift-buying rush.The employees really appreciate all of their shoppers being patient, treating them with respect, and remembering not to wear red shirts to the store (that is their uniform, after all, and it can get confusing who is who sometimes).Remember, It is the holidays, so spread good cheer to all, including Target employees.More From GOBankingRatesZelle Scams on Facebook Marketplace: How To Recognize and Avoid ThemTake a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewThe 10 Best Cash Back Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Things Target Employees Want You To Know About Holiday Shopping]"

That would come in below last year's 13.5% jump and the 9.3% gain in 2020.Retailers began offering unusually early discounts this year.Target Corp, Kohls Corp and Amazon.com Inc ran early Black Friday deals that discounted toys and some other goods by as much as 50%.Those companies did not respond to requests for comment.Even with steep discounts, consumers will have to spend more for popular products like a PJ Masks toy car or Mattel Inc's Mega Hauler semi-truck because prices have risen faster than promotions, according to data provided by DataWeave.Mattel did not respond to a request to comment.Shoppers are being wooed as the closely followed University of Michigan consumer sentiment poll was revised up Wednesday to up to 56.8 from 54.7, beating the consensus expectation of 55.0 but still below the 59.9 in October. Expectations for purchasing long-lasting manufactured goods fell 21% due to high interest rates and high prices, the survey found.""The sentiment data has been sliding sideways as consumers try to reconcile solid economic and labor market conditions against expectations of a recession and harmful inflation,"" said Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Anna Driver and Richard Chang)]"

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-140053587.html,1669384853.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.46bUS$2.71bUS$3.10bUS$3.39bUS$3.62bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.14bUS$4.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.12%Est @ 6.98%Est @ 5.48%Est @ 4.43%Est @ 3.69%Est @ 3.18% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$95bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$95b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$50bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$73b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$264, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.898. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

Shares have added about 6.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sallie Mae due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Sallie Mae Q3 Earnings Miss, NII BeatSallie Mae's third-quarter core earnings per share of 29 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. The bottom line indicates a rise of 20.8% from the prior quarter. Core earnings per share exclude mark-to-fair value unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts.Sallie Mae completed $1 billion of private education loan sales in the third quarter, resulting in a $75-million gain. Moreover, the results were supported by higher NII and fee income. However, a rise in expenses and provision for credit losses affected bottom-line growth.The company plans to dispose of its credit card business to recycle resources in its core business strategies. Meanwhile, it will process completed credit card applications received by 2022 end. As of the third-quarter end, SLM had $29 million of credit card loans held for sale.The company’s GAAP net income attributable to common stock was $72.6 million, up 1.3% from the previous-year quarter.NII Improves, Expenses ClimbNII in the third quarter was $369.5 million, up 3.4% year over year. Also, the reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $359 million.The net interest margin (NIM) expanded to 5.27% from 5.03% in the year-ago quarter.The company’s non-interest income was $95.1 million, significantly up from the prior-year quarter’s $13.9 million. The rise mainly stemmed from net gains on sales of loans.Sallie Mae's non-interest expenses increased 8.2% year over year to $152.3 million. The increase mainly resulted from higher other operating expenses.Story continuesCredit Quality DeterioratesThe company recorded a provision for credit losses of $207.6 million, up from the prior-year quarter’s $138.4 million. Net charge-offs were $100.2 million, significantly up from the prior-year quarter’s $48.9 million.Balance Sheet Position RobustAs of Sep 30, 2022, deposits of Sallie Mae were $21.27 billion, up 6.5% sequentially.Private education loan held for investment was $18.98 billion, up 2.5% on a sequential basis. In the quarter, the company witnessed private education loan originations of $2.4 billion, increasing 13% from the year-ago quarter.Capital Deployment ActivitiesIn the third quarter, the company repurchased 1 million common stocks for $17 million under its share repurchase program.2022 OutlookThe company expects core earnings per share (on a non-GAAP basis) of $2.50-$2.60.It anticipates total loan portfolio net charge-offs of $325-$345 million.Private education loan originations are projected to grow 9-11% year over year.The company’s non-interest expenses are expected to be $555-$565 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 19.4% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Sallie Mae has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Sallie Mae has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSallie Mae belongs to the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry.

Helping, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester just said, “We’re at a point where we’re going to enter a restrictive stance of policy. At that point, I think it makes sense that we can slow down a bit the … pace of increases. We’re still going to raise the fund’s rate, but we’re at a reasonable point now where we can be very deliberate in setting monetary policy, as quoted by CNBC. With that, some of the fear in the market has cooled off, creating a very long list of stocks to watch, including:SHLSShoals Technologies$29.85COINCoinbase$42.94MSTRMicroStrategy$165.41TANInvesco Solar ETF$81.06MMacy’s$23.34ROSTRoss Stores$114.33DISWalt Disney$95.40Shoals Technologies (SHLS)ESG stocks: Solar energy panels are arranged in a green field under a sunny sky.Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.comSolar energy stocks could see brighter days ahead. For example, Shoals (NASDAQ:SHLS) just reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with record Q3 revenue of $93 million. The company also increased the lower end of its full-year revenue guidance and announced that it expects its EBITDA, excluding certain items, to come in at an impressive $80 million to $86 million.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCEO Jason Whitaker noted that the company was benefiting from a tariff exemption on Chinese solar panels implemented by President Joe Biden, along with high natural gas prices and the climate bill passed by Congress. Moreover, China, which has clearly made the decision to move towards reopening its economy, is likely to continue doing so, reassuring the Street that the Asian nation is going to continue pumping out solar panels at a fast pace and possibly even accelerate its production of solar products. With solar panel supplies running behind demand, China’s reopening should boost Shoals’ business and SHLS stock next month. Further, providing Shoals and SHLS stock with another positive catalyst, the European Union is likely to continue to implement its package of pro-solar rules and incentives next month.Story continuesCoinbase (COIN)The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.Source: Primakov / Shutterstock.comCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) isn’t a buy just yet, especially with a plethora of negative catalysts. First, the alleged misdeeds of failed crypto exchange FTX, along with the tremendous amount of publicity that the media has given the exchange’s collapse, have undermined confidence in crypto exchanges in general. Although COIN’s contention that it has done nothing wrong may be absolutely correct, fear is likely to cause COIN’s customers to rush to withdraw their crypto from the exchange. There is a high likelihood that such a scenario, in turn, could cause a classic “bank run” event, quickly causing COIN to run out of cash. Since no government or large bank is likely to come to COIN’s rescue and no one is going to want to buy its stock, the bank run could easily result in bankruptcy.On another front, the U.S. government is also indicating that it will respond to FTX’s failure by more tightly regulating the crypto sector. Increased regulation of the sector could greatly undermine Coinbase’s business. After all, FTX’s failure and alleged misdeeds could give the agency reason to be extremely harsh on Coinbase. As if all that wasn’t enough, Bitcoin has tumbled to two-year lows, likely further deterring investors from placing trades on Coinbase’s exchange. Given all of these points, stocks like COIN are highly likely to keep sinking next month, providing investors with a very good short-selling opportunity.MicroStrategy (MSTR)MICROSTRATEGY - sign at headquarters building.

At a (hypothetical) average price of $20,000 per Bitcoin, that works out to a nearly $2.6 billion investment in the crypto. Worse, in Sept. the company sought to sell $500 million of MSTR stock to buy even more Bitcoin. Bitcoin has tumbled an eye-popping 66% this year and 22% in just the last month. After FTX’s implosion and the tremendous retreat of Bitcoin this year, not many investors are going to have the stomach to buy the crypto and most are likely to look to unload it. Therefore, its value is likely to continue to plunge going forward.Bitcoin seems to have failed completely both as a hedge against inflation and as a store of value. Moreover, few if any consumers or companies are actually using it. Rather, in line with my longtime predictions, it’s now obvious that Bitcoin and other cryptos are primarily bubbles that inflate when there’s a great deal of stimulus in the economy and deflate when the “punch bowl” is taken away. With the bowl being withdrawn, Bitcoin is likely to continue to plunge, causing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment to also continue to tumble. As a result, MSTR stock is likely to keep plunging next month and is not one of the top stocks to buy at this point.Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comWith the U.S. and EU providing tremendous support for solar energy, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) could see brighter days ahead. Also worth noting is that the U.S. Commerce Department is due to decide by Dec. 1 whether to accept a petition to impose tariffs on solar panels imported from a number of Southeast Asian countries. As I mentioned when discussing Shoals, President Biden has implemented a two-year exemption on solar panel imports from Southeast Asia. Therefore, an adverse decision by the department will not negatively affect solar companies for some time, and the exemption gives them adequate time to adjust their supply chains in preparation for the imposition of tariffs on panels imported from the affected countries.If, however, the department decides to reject the petition, solar stocks, including TAN, are likely to rally, due to the removal of a “headline risk” that has been facing the sector. The fact that the climate bill passed by Democrats provides a great deal of financial support for domestic solar companies could give the department the “cover” it needs to reject the petition.In a separate development, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) recently initiated coverage of a number of U.S.-based solar stocks with “buy” ratings. Among the names to which it gave “buy” ratings are three of TAN’s six largest holdings — Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH), Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN), and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR).Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comSome retail stocks, like Macy’s (NYSE:M) just delivered “beat-and-raise” third-quarter results. The apparel retailer’s revenue fell 4% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, but its sales came in slightly above analysts’ average outlook. Better, on the bottom line, Macy’s reported Q3 EPS of 53 cents, meaningfully higher than analysts’ mean outlook of 19 cents. And the company increased its full-year EPS estimate, excluding some items, to $4.07-$4.27 from $4-$4,20 previously.In addition, the comparable sales of Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s luxury store, increased 4% year-over-year last quarter. The increase suggests that Macy’s high-end customers could spend a great deal at Bloomingdale’s over the holiday shopping season, boosting Macy’s bottom line and making investors more upbeat about M stock. Additionally, the healthy increase in Bloomingdale’s comparable sales suggests that high-end consumers in general, in line with my previous predictions, are starting to spend more money on goods again. As inflation eases and we enter the heart of the holiday shopping season, middle-class consumers are likely to follow suit, causing investors to become more confident in Macy’s. Given all of these points, M stock will probably rise significantly next month and looks like a good stock to buy at this point.Ross Stores (ROST)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockDiscount retailer Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) reported better-than-expected Q3 results and raised its full-year EPS guidance, leaving its stock well-positioned to rally in Dec. On the bottom line, Ross reported Q3 EPS of $1, versus analysts’ average estimate of 82 cents. Its revenue was little changed YOY, coming in at $4.57 billion, $200 million above analysts’ mean estimate. The retailer’s comparable sales fell 3% year-over-year, but the company pointed out that its comp sales had soared 14% YOY in Q3 of 2021. ROST increased its 2022 EPS outlook to $4.21-$4.34, versus its previous guidance of $3.84-$4.12.In the wake of Ross’ results, research firm Gordon Haskett raised its rating on ROST to “buy” from “hold,” as it believes that the company’s results were “dramatically better than expected.” The firm thinks that Ross appears to have “turned a corner,” while the discount-retailer sector can reward investors going forward. “We remain in the early innings of a trade-down which, when coupled with material freight expense relief and…healthy [gross margins], paves the way for a very meaningful upward EPS revision cycle,” the firm stated.Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockThe abrupt return of former Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger seems to have enchanted the Street. Apparently many investors believe that Iger, who replaced the hapless Bob Chapek, can return the old magic to Disney and DIS stock. With Disney not scheduled to report any quarterly earnings until early Feb. and views of the U.S. economy likely to improve as inflation continues to weaken, optimism about Iger’s return could push DIS stock much higher next month.However, the “changing of the Bobs” doesn’t alter my longtime, bearish stance on Disney and DIS stock. That’s because, with cable continuing to bleed subscribers at a significant rate, the revenue and profits of the company’s lucrative cable channels are going to continue to sink. Meanwhile, the company’s streaming channels are likely to lose money for the foreseeable future, and movie attendance in the U.S. will probably keep trending far below pre-pandemic levels.From what I’ve read, Iger’s big point of difference with Chapek involves charging less for the company’s streaming channels. That change might push up the number of consumers subscribing to Disney+. But I believe that the Street is well past the point of being impressed by the channel’s subscriber numbers and has figured out that streaming is not, in the near term or medium term, going to offset the profit declines caused by the weakening of the company’s cable and movie businesses. As a result, I recommend that investors sell stocks, such as DIS stock into strength in Dec. and Jan.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in SHLS and a short position in COIN.

157,4459de06-c064-34d4-962c-61e981885299,V,2022-11-26,Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-favoured-110030804.html,1669460430,STORY,['V'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Visa. See our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Visa. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Visa's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Visa. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of VisaThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Visa Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$230m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Visa. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

(V) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-visa-inc-140002250.html,1669384802,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 8.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.68 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.8%. The $31.9 billion and $35.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.8% and +11.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.12%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

V recently reported encouraging transaction results for October and November (till 21 Nov), despite suspending operations in Russia in March. The financial transaction juggernaut witnessed 9% year-over-year growth in U.S. payments volume in November. The volume increased by 10% in October. Individuals gaining confidence in traveling will likely continue boosting its results.Per the regulatory filing by Visa, global processed transactions jumped 10% in November and 11% in October, from the prior-year period. The volume was 140% of the 2019 level. Credit payments volume in the U.S. increased 10% in November, while debit payments rose 8%. In October, credit payments were up 12% and debit payments climbed 9%.Total cross-border volume increased 19% year over year in November, following a 24% jump in October. Excluding intra-Europe transactions, cross-border volume rose 28% year over year in November and 36% in October. Travel cross-border volume growth in the Asia Pacific region is likely to buoy Visa’s performance. If this trend continues, the company is likely to register a significant year-over-year increase in volumes in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The price inflation is likely to keep benefiting Visa’s revenues. The ongoing recovery in travel and entertainment is expected to keep the volumes up. However, some factors can affect the figures. Even though the company has managed to continue growing, bypassing the ongoing turmoil, the growth rate is witnessing a declining trend. Fed rate hikes can trigger higher savings and lower spending levels. Macroeconomic volatility can also be a cause of concern.Trend in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for V’s current-quarter earnings is pegged at $2 per share, indicating a 10.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The stock has witnessed four upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against five in the opposite direction.

Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.Other major shareholders Independent Franchise Partners and Irenic Capital have also opposed Murdoch's plan, disclosed in October, to recombine the companies that he separated in 2013.Fox and News Corp said in October they formed special committees to review proposals for a potential combination.Independent Franchise Partners owns about 7% of News Corp's Class A shares and 6.4% in Fox Corp. Activist investor Irenic Capital Management holds 2% of News Corp's shares.T. Rowe Price wanted to make its concerns known to the boards and the public before the companies put forward any firm proposal, the newspaper quoted Vincent DeAugustino, one of the portfolio managers who oversees T. Rowe's investment in News Corp, as saying.""It's more constructive to help form the process than try to push back against any proposal once it's been made,"" DeAugustino told the newspaper, adding that T. Rowe Price had raised its concerns with News Corp's special committee in recent weeks.The asset management firm also had concerns related to the potential financial consequences of litigation against Fox News by the voting machine companies Dominion and Smartmatic, DeAugustino said.He also cited worries that the special committees appointed to review the deal were not sufficiently independent.Story continuesIn the 2013 split, Murdoch put his publishing business in News Corp, a newly created public entity, and the TV and entertainment businesses under 21st Century Fox.Analysts have raised concerns over the merger, saying that News Corp needs to simplify by selling off or spinning off assets instead of recombining with Fox. Any deal would require the support of independent shareholders.(Reporting by Akriti Sharma and Jaiveer Singh Shekhawat in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler, Cynthia Osterman and Edmund Klamann)]"

The new company could look for ways to integrate its media properties. It could also explore ways to use the company’s assets for emerging business lines, such as sports betting, for which Fox has already received a green signal in buying a stake at Fanduel. The merged companies could potentially save money by hiring one management team and maintaining one set of relationships with vendors, the people said.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe advantage that Fox could draw from the merger would be to diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue to its top line.The publishing wing of Murdoch’s empire, News Corp, has been performing better than expected. The Journal.ie, part of its Dow Jones unit, enjoyed robust growth in its digital-subscription business over the past few years. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 9% year over year.The digital real-estate unit and book-publishing business have also propelled growth. Revenues in the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 7% year over year to $443 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Shares of Fox Corp and News corp have declined 15.8% and 18.3% respectively year to date, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which fell 33.5%.Despite such tailwinds, the merger could only be carried out successfully if the major shareholders of both companies are in support of it.Concerns such as the redundant print-advertising model of News Corp, its reliance on countries outside the United States for the majority of its revenues during the ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength have to be addressed to the investors.Story continuesZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider.Fox Corp currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Liberty Media FWONK and Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Thermo Fisher’s instruments are used to monitor and protect air, water, and food quality, and the company has strong long-term fundamentals, a top-tier management team and a diversified business.”9.

Booking was an investment in the Fund at Inception and was featured in our inaugural June 2019 Quarterly Report. The company owns the world’s largest online travel agent (OTA), Booking.com. To say the past 2.5 years has been volatile for Booking is a major understatement. Booking’s management has had to address the COVID-19-driven collapse in demand for travel accommodation, as well as to manage volatile demand as the world gradually recovers, interrupted by second and third waves of COVID-19 as variants arise.Throughout these volatile market conditions, Booking’s management has executed against a consistent strategy, investing in its platform and network of accommodation providers, and expanding its associated services while improving efficiencies. We believe Booking will come out of the COVID-19 environment a stronger business, with less competition and consumers more predisposed to booking their travel accommodation online. Travel is recovering strongly as vaccination rates increase and COVID-19 related restrictions are lifted, and we expect Booking’s earnings and cash flow to also recover strongly over the coming years.”8.

Witty is known as a mission-driven CEO who clearly articulates his view that providing high-quality, affordable health care services is a social good. He receives consistently high marks from former colleagues, and we believe that his leadership approach will ballast and even strengthen UNH’s already impressive management and employee ranks.

(NASDAQ:FB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“To say traditional media is anti-Facebook would not be an overstatement. An already intense and multi-year critique of (or attack on) Facebook has ratcheted up in recent weeks. Facebook’s research efforts have been reported on, if often derided, for nearly a decade. Going back to 2014, Slate.com called their research practices “unethical” when FB tried to study the impact social posts had on users. Now those efforts have been turned against them for the kill shot.My job is to observe, assess, and allocate. Not to commentate on all the whims and wishes of media narrative. However, in the case of Facebook I cannot avoid going into some detail re: the onslaught against them, which I find to be most unwarranted and insincere.Last month the Wall Street Journal ran a five-piece series titled “The Facebook Files” which allegedly shows how toxic Instagram is for teens. The foundation of their argument was a single slide from an internal presentation claiming, based on FB’s own research, that of teens who had a negative self-image, one-third said Instagram “made them feel worse.”iii Somehow the implication here is that this is not an inescapable aspect of either the human psyche and/or society-at large, but that it is of Facebook’s doing…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see Was Alexander West's Blue Pool Capital Right About These 5 Stocks?   Suggested articles:11 Best Bitcoin Stocks To BuyGoldman Sachs Dividend Stocks10 Undervalued European Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic; second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)9.

The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term.

(NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8.

PayPal has been one of the more high-profile victims of the market’s brutal ruthlessness over the past few months, and the stock fell by over two-thirds between its peak in July to the beginning of March this year. As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business.

It anticipates earnings to improve 8.8% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.98% compares favorably with the industry’s (3.32%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book, courtesy of the platform’s unique features, despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. These, in turn, position it well to sustain momentum in robot sales.Stryker is committed to the continued expansion of Mako. Although the company saw softening in Mako installation during the third quarter due to variability in the hospital environment, it expects strong demand in the fourth quarter. The company continues to focus on the continued expansion of the platform. This growth reflects the demand for Stryker’s differentiated Mako robotic technology.Taking into account the normalization of the customer environment, management anticipates another strong year for Mako in 2022. The company’s Mako order book remains solid for 2022 and is in sync with its aim of continued share gains in both hips and knees.Additionally, Stryker has a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products shields the company against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil. Its significant exposure to robotics, artificial intelligence for health care and Medical Mechatronics has helped the company stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. Stryker’s portfolio includes products like Hip, Knee and Mako robotic-arm assisted surgeries.Story continuesOn its third-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries, after getting adversely impacted last year due to COVID. The company stated that it is reaching normalized levels across most of its business. Moreover, it expects hospital staffing pressure to resolve gradually, leading to higher procedures in 2023.Per management, the company’s sustained support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the pandemic subsides. In the third quarter of 2022, Stryker’s adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 7.1% of net sales, highlighting its sustained commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches. In September, Stryker launched its new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System — for spine application. The company received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its OptaBlate bone tumor ablation system in the same month.Moreover, Stryker’s action to lessen the inflationary pressure and cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins look promising. The 9.2% year-over-year decline in SG&amp;A expenses during the third quarter was probably due to these actions, implying that margins may improve going forward.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable pricing environment poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the period’s average selling days were in line with third-quarter 2021. The impact from pricing was 0.7% in the last reported quarter. Consequently, pricing pressure remains a cause of concern. Moreover, unfavorable currency rate fluctuation has also hurt top-line growth, which may continue to impact revenues moderately in 2023.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteEstimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $9.17 and $9.83, respectively, suggesting year-over-year growth of 0.9% and 7.3%.

This is especially true as the holiday-shortened week is usually a bullish feast for stock investors, even with low volumes, as consumer spending is expected to rise.Stocks with a history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.

These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Air Products and Chemicals' (NYSE:APD) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Air Products and Chemicals, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 10%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the Chemicals industry. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Air Products and Chemicals compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Air Products and Chemicals' ROCE Trend?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 48% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 10%. 10% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Air Products and Chemicals has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn the end, Air Products and Chemicals has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 116% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Air Products and Chemicals  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The new company could look for ways to integrate its media properties. It could also explore ways to use the company’s assets for emerging business lines, such as sports betting, for which Fox has already received a green signal in buying a stake at Fanduel. The merged companies could potentially save money by hiring one management team and maintaining one set of relationships with vendors, the people said.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe advantage that Fox could draw from the merger would be to diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue to its top line.The publishing wing of Murdoch’s empire, News Corp, has been performing better than expected. The Journal.ie, part of its Dow Jones unit, enjoyed robust growth in its digital-subscription business over the past few years. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 9% year over year.The digital real-estate unit and book-publishing business have also propelled growth. Revenues in the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased 7% year over year to $443 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Shares of Fox Corp and News corp have declined 15.8% and 18.3% respectively year to date, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which fell 33.5%.Despite such tailwinds, the merger could only be carried out successfully if the major shareholders of both companies are in support of it.Concerns such as the redundant print-advertising model of News Corp, its reliance on countries outside the United States for the majority of its revenues during the ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength have to be addressed to the investors.Story continuesZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider.Fox Corp currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Liberty Media FWONK and Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with the outlook so far. So, Ali, how is it looking.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rochelle. You're right. You know, the content, it isn't really there like it's been in years past, but we do have some new titles out over this weekend that could surprise at the box office. If we take a look at the theatrical exclusives this weekend, we have a lot of Disney with the animated film ""Strange World."" We should also see continued success from ""Wakanda Forever,"" but probably one of the most anticipated is that sequel to ""Knives Out.""Now this movie will only be available in select markets for one week before it moves over to Netflix at the end of December, but I spoke with Sean Robbins. He's the chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro, and he told me that the level of success here could really make this a watershed moment when it comes to the relationship between streaming platforms and exhibitors as this is probably the most talked about, the buzziest streaming title to open exclusively in cinemas. And it's just this vote of confidence when it comes to the theatrical experience, when it comes to the ability for the box office to really turn a profit for these types of films.We did get the news earlier this week that Amazon will reportedly be investing $1 billion to produce 12 to 15 movies a year exclusively for theaters, and that report sent shares of movie theater chains like AMC and Cinemark higher. So I think there's still a lot more to come when we think about this relationship. We've come a long way from 2020 and 2021, but Netflix, of course, has largely been resistant. So we'll see if ""Glass Onion"" can change that type of strategy.Story continuesOverall, though the Thanksgiving box office is expected to pull in about 100 million plus over the three-day weekend, 140 million plus over the five days. So as you can see that's roughly on par with 2021, but we're still significantly below 2019 levels with that three-day pulling in 181 million and the five-day, a whopping 262 million. And a lot of that has to do with the types of movies that are out. Hopefully, we'll see that start to stabilize in 2023.- Yeah, Ali, I haven't even watched the first ""Knives Out."" I got a lot of catching up to do this weekend.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You do. Good.- I've heard great reviews. As you said, you know, this weekend has historically been the kickoff to what is a busy holiday movie season. Hasn't been the case the last few years. But how are things stacking up? What's the pipeline looking like going into year end?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Absolutely the biggest film coming up in year end is the sequel ""Avatar 2."" This has been a movie that James Cameron has been talking about for years. The original ""Avatar"" aired in 2009, so a lot of time people have been waiting for this. And the film got the green light this week to air in China, and that was also a huge deal for Hollywood, a huge deal for this movie. That country has been notorious when it comes to rejecting films, and if we take a look at ticket sales from that original ""Avatar"" in 2009, overall, it grossed $2.74 billion with $202 million coming from mainland China.So that's a significant market for these types of films. And overall, ""Avatar 2,"" it cost a pretty penny. Reports have it at around $250 million plus, so it needs to do well. And in terms of the projections, we have a long range forecast from Boxoffice Pro between $135 million to $175 million, so that's the number to watch.I do have high expectations. People love this franchise. It's certainly a long time coming, but we'll have to wait and see if it can deliver. But considering this is probably going to be the biggest film at the end of the year, we're not-- it's not gonna really have that much competition. I do think all eyes are going to be on this, and it's going to continue well into the first quarter of 2023 as well.- Yeah, I mean, just the kind of movie that you want to actually go to the theaters to watch if you saw the first ""Avatar,"" but we'll be watching that one as well. Thanks so much for that, Ali.]"

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase M&amp;T Bank's shares before the 30th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.20 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.80 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, M&amp;T Bank stock has a trailing yield of around 2.8% on the current share price of $172.14. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether M&amp;T Bank's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see M&amp;T Bank paying out a modest 46% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at M&amp;T Bank, with earnings per share up 3.3% on average over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, M&amp;T Bank has lifted its dividend by approximately 5.5% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs M&amp;T Bank an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? M&amp;T Bank has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. In summary, M&amp;T Bank appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for M&amp;T Bank that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

198,b4d63309-e789-398c-9cb1-4aa4a2d8384e,HP,2022-11-26,Petrobras (PBR) Slides Despite Q3 Earnings Beat: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-pbr-slides-despite-q3-133701395.html,1669383421,STORY,"['PETR3.SA', 'PBR-A', 'HAL', 'DINO', 'HP']","[The stock of Brazil's state-run energy giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras PBR, has lost 12.4% since its third-quarter results were announced on Nov 3. The negative response, despite an earnings beat, could be attributed to risks pertaining to political intervention and the company’s huge dividend outgo.What Did Petrobras’ Earnings Unveil?Petrobras announced third-quarter earnings per ADS of $1.35, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 and significantly improving from the year-ago profit of 52 cents. The outperformance can be attributed to higher oil prices and strong downstream results, which more than offset the rising pre-salt lifting costs.Recurring net income, which strips one-time items, came in at $8,803 million compared to $3,332 million a year earlier. Petrobras’ adjusted EBITDA rose to $17,410 million from $11,623 million a year ago.The company reported revenues of $32,411 million, which jumped 39.4% from the year-earlier sales of $23,255 million but came in slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32,541 million due to lower oil and gas production.In further good news for investors, Petrobras plans to pay RMB 43.7 billion or roughly $8.5 billion in total dividends.  Coming back to earnings, let's take a deeper look at the recent performances of PBR’s two main segments: Upstream (Exploration &amp; Production) and Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing).Upstream: The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s average oil and gas production during the third quarter reached 2,644 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) — 80% liquids — down from 2,830 MBOE/d in the same period of 2021.Compared with the year-ago quarter, Brazilian oil and natural gas production — constituting approximately 99% of the total output — decreased 6.5% to 2,609 MBOE/d. The downside was blamed on decommissioning of a facility’s normal field declines, plus Petrobras’ lower working interests in the Atapu and Sepia fields, following production-sharing contracts.In the July-to-September period, the average sales price of oil in Brazil surged 42.1% from the year-earlier period to $98.81 per barrel. The sharp increase in crude prices more than offset the dip in production, and thereby had a positive effect on upstream unit sales. Overall, the segment’s revenues jumped to $19,293 million in the quarter under review from $14,628 million in the year-ago period.But as far as the bottom line is concerned, an uptick in pre-salt lifting costs (which rose 23.2% from the third quarter of 2021 to $5.36 per barrel) meant that the upstream unit recorded a net income of $7,591 million, down 4.8% from third-quarter 2021 earnings of $7,971 million.Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing): Revenues from the segment totaled $29,348 million, up 43.2% from the year-ago figure of $20,500 million on higher fuel sales price. Petrobras' downstream unit came up with a profit of $1,340 million, which compared favorably with earnings of $1,046 million in the third quarter of 2021. The surge was on account of strong oil product margins in the domestic market.Story continuesCostsDuring the period, Petrobras’ sales, general and administrative expenses were $1,547 million, 7.4% higher than the year-ago period. Selling expenses also rose from $1,103 million a year ago to $1,213 million. Moreover, the absence of the year-ago quarter’s massive reverse impairment of $3,098 million led to a $3,366 million increase in total operating expenses.The jump in costs was more than neutralized by soaring revenues, which meant that PBR reported an operating income of $14,170 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $12,392 million a year ago.Financial PositionDuring the three months ended Sep 30, 2022, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures (excluding signature bonus) totaled $2,131 million compared with $1,863 million in the prior-year quarter.Importantly, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company generated a positive free cash flow for the 30th consecutive quarter, with the metric rising to $10,117 million from $9,023 million recorded in last year’s corresponding period.At the end of the third quarter, Petrobras had a net debt of $47,483 million, down from $48,132 million a year ago but up from $34,435 million as of Jun 30, 2022. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,374 million.Meanwhile, Petrobras’ net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio improved to 0.75 from 1.17 in the previous year. However, it deteriorated from 0.60 at the end of the second quarter of 2022.Other Energy PicksApart from Petrobras, investors interested in the energy sector might look at HF Sinclair DINO, Helmerich &amp; Payne HP and Halliburton HAL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.HF Sinclair: HF Sinclair is valued at some $13 billion.

DINO shares have surged 90.2% in a year.Helmerich &amp; Payne: HP beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.83bUS$2.97bUS$3.21bUS$3.80bUS$4.08bUS$4.32bUS$4.52bUS$4.69bUS$4.85bUS$4.99bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 7.47%Est @ 5.82%Est @ 4.67%Est @ 3.86%Est @ 3.3%Est @ 2.9% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$3.0kUS$3.0kUS$3.0kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$29bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$124bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$124b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$69bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$97b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$76.8, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Colgate-Palmolive, there are three further aspects you should consider:Risks: For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive  that you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does CL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Comcast's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Comcast peKeen to find out how analysts think Comcast's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Comcast?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Comcast would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 62%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 54% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 52% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Comcast's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From Comcast's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Comcast's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Comcast that you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

Shares have added about 20.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is United Rentals due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.United Rentals (URI) Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues Lag, View UpUnited Rentals, Inc. reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.URI also lifted its full-year guidance for total revenues and adjusted EBITDA, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility.Looking forward, Matthew Flannery, CEO of United Rentals, said, “While there are clearly cross-currents in the economy, virtually all key non-residential construction indicators remain encouraging, including customer sentiment. In addition, we see substantial opportunities next year across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. We expect to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow, and attractive returns for our shareholders.”Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of $9.27 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9 by 3%. The reported figure also increased 40.9% from the prior-year figure of $6.58 per share.Total revenues of $3.05 billion missed the consensus mark of $3.09 billion by 1.2% but grew 17.5% year over year. Rental revenues increased 20% from the year-ago quarter to $2.73 billion. This marks the record third-quarter results. This upside was mainly attributable to a broad-based recovery of activity across end markets served by the company. Fleet productivity was up 8.9% and average original equipment at cost grew 10.6% year over year.Yet, used equipment sales decreased 1.1% from a year ago. Adjusted gross margin of 64.6% expanded 1,430 basis points (bps) due to higher pricing, given higher pricing on used equipment sales.Story continuesSegment DiscussionGeneral Rentals: This segment registered 18.7% year-over-year growth in rental revenues to $1.94 billion. Rental gross margin expanded 130 bps year over year to 41%, courtesy of improved fixed cost absorption due to higher revenues.Specialty (earlier known as Trench, Power and Pump): Segmental rental revenues increased 23.2% year over year to $790 million. Rentals gross margin expanded 70 bps on a year-over-year basis to 52.2%.MarginsThe company’s total equipment rentals gross margin rose 130 bps year over year to 44.3%.Adjusted EBITDA also grew 23.4% from the prior-year quarter to $1,521 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 240 bps to 49.9% for the quarter, owing to higher margins from rental revenues and used equipment sales.Balance SheetUnited Rentals had cash and cash equivalents of $76 million as of Sep 30, 2022, down from $144 million at 2021-end. Total liquidity was $2.843 billion at September-end.Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2022, was $9.75 billion, up from $8.78 billion at 2021-end.Cash from operating activities increased 5.1% year over year to $1,142 million for the quarter. Free cash flow grew 91.3% year over year to $176 million for the third quarter of 2022.2022 Guidance UpdatedTotal revenues are expected in the range of $11.5-$11.7 billion versus $11.4-$11.7 billion projected earlier. This indicates an increase from $9.72 billion reported in 2021.Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion compared with the prior projection of $5.4-$5.55 billion. The current projection indicates a jump from the year-ago figure of $4.41 billion.Net rental capital expenditure after gross purchases is now projected within $2.25 billion-$2.45 billion (versus prior expectation of $1.85-$2.05 billion), indicating an increase from $2.03 billion in 2021.Net cash provided by operating activities is anticipated in the range of $4.05-$4.4 billion (compared with $3.85-$4.25 billion expected earlier), suggesting a rise from $3.69 billion in 2021.Free cash flow (excluding the impact of merger and restructuring-related payments) is expected in the range of $1.6-$1.8 billion compared with $1.85-$2.05 billion anticipated earlier. This suggests an increase from $1.53 billion reported in 2021.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 5.28% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, United Rentals has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

204,76852f2a-95d3-39ad-945d-e14b3aa0c2c4,ORCL,2022-11-26,Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-corporation-orcl-trending-stock-140002920.html,1669384802,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Oracle (ORCL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +9.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has gained 2.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.55 indicates a change of +11.8% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Oracle.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ORCL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Oracle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $49.59 billion and $52.97 billion estimates indicate +16.8% and +6.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $11.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. EPS of $1.03 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.18%. The EPS surprise was -3.74%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

205,154fba72-701b-3527-91da-3b1d1c644275,ORCL,2022-11-26,Here’s What the Oracle Layoffs Mean for ORCL Stock,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-layoffs-mean-orcl-stock-172833904.html,1669138113,STORY,['ORCL'],"[It’s been a tough year for tech firms, including hardware and software supplier Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). A recent round of Oracle layoffs, along with a pricey purchase of healthcare data company Cerner, has some ORCL stock investors feeling anxious. Yet, the layoffs are a necessary step to help slim Oracle down. Besides, the company’s cloud-business growth will help keep Oracle on solid financial ground.As you may be aware, Oracle acquired Cerner in June for $28.3 billion. Prior to that, Oracle took out a $15 billion loan to help fund the Cerner acquisition. The next thing you know, inflation ramped up, interest rates jumped, and Big Tech was in big trouble.So, is Oracle on a collision course? Or will the company recover? Look to the cloud for the answer — and consider Oracle’s retrenchment efforts a crucial part of the company’s path back to prosperity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhat’s Happening With Oracle Layoffs?Clearly, the $15 billion loan won’t be enough to fund the Cerner acquisition. Consequently, in July, Oracle reportedly sought to reduce its headcount to reduce expenditures by $1 billion.Fast forward to August. By then, Oracle was “running into multiple headwinds, including the Cerner acquisition, US inflation, foreign exchange issues, and slowing deal velocity that will lower revenues for the next year,” according to Amalgam Insight analyst Hyoun Park. So, Oracle started reducing its staff in the company’s San Francisco Bay-area offices.Then, in October, Oracle laid off an additional 201 employees. They had worked at Oracle’s office in Redwood Shores, California. These workforce reductions might worry some investors. But should they?A Lean Team and Cloud Growth Could Propel ORCL StockAs always, InvestorPlace contributor William White offered a clear-minded perspective on recent events. He assured, “Those layoffs aren’t as major as some would expect, considering Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has more than 10,000 employees.”Story continuesIndeed, while some of Oracle’s job cuts hit the company’s cloud division, the company still retains an army of cloud specialists. In other words, Oracle’s headcount reductions are a necessary part of the company’s recovery efforts in the wake of the expensive Cerner buyout.Besides, no reasonable investor would conclude that Oracle’s cloud division is about to self-destruct. Not long ago, the company projected that it will generate a whopping $65 billion in annual revenue by fiscal year 2026 — with cloud infrastructure being a significant contributor to this.What You Can Do NowThe last thing you want to do now is panic just because of the Oracle layoffs. It’s part of a retrenchment process that should benefit the company over the long term.Rest assured, even if Oracle has to lay off some cloud-division workers, the company will remain a powerful force in the cloud market. Therefore, you can hold your ORCL stock shares, as the workforce reduction isn’t the end of the road for Oracle.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.David Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

Check out our latest analysis for Micron Technology peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Micron Technology.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?Micron Technology's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very poor growth or even falling earnings, and importantly, perform much worse than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 50%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 41% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 9.5% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 9.0% per year.In light of this, it's understandable that Micron Technology's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.We've established that Micron Technology maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Micron Technology  you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

If you want to read about some more Nancy Pelosi stocks, go directly to 5 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy Now.The stock trading activities of lawmakers in the United States have always made for interesting case studies. This is because a sizable number of US lawmakers engage in stock trading. Until the past few years, making large amounts of money from these trades was considered a side-benefit of winning a seat in the US Congress. In order to make these trades more transparent, the STOCK Act of April 2012 was passed, requiring lawmakers to disclose their stock trading through a Periodic Transaction Report within 45 days of the transaction.  Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since 2019, is one of the most active stock traders in the US Congress. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, runs a venture capital firm. Some of the top stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio include prominent names like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Lately, Pelosi has been quietly buying the dip on tech stocks that have witnessed a large correction in their prices due to rising interest rates. Our MethodologyThe companies listed below were picked from the Periodic Transaction Report(s) that US politicians who trade stocks are obliged to file. It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public record of investments Nancy Pelosi and her family have made in the past few months. The purchases may not have been made by Pelosi herself but only disclosed on behalf of her husband, Paul Pelosi, who runs a venture capital firm. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.12 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy NowBest Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy Now12.

Here is what the fund said:“Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) got significantly more attention from both institutional &amp; retail investors after Facebook announced to rename itself as Meta Platforms. I believe the price appreciation is largely attributed to the increased attention. On the business side, Roblox rolled out a few successful music events and also partnered with Netflix on testing long-form media consumption in the virtual world. Apple in its iOS 14.5 rolled out an impactful change for the digital advertising landscape by requiring all apps to ask users to “opt-in”.10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68   American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provides charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services. It is one of the major stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio. On October 18, Simon Property Group and fintech firm Cardless revealed that they have agreed to introduce a credit card of American Express which gives their users up to 3% cash back on eligible purchases made at Simon’s shopping malls.

Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise amid a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”9. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. It is one of the premier stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio. On October 21, Micron Technology noted that it had signed a license and settlement agreement with subsidiaries of Wi-LAN.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.1 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. It is one of the prominent stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio.

Mandatory filings from late March show that Pelosi exercised 25 CALL options on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock worth somewhere around $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 on March 17. The strike price was $500 and the options were due to expire on March 18. On October 20, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner maintained a Buy rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $355 from $390, noting that the company reported a Q3 earnings miss compared to expectations, with mostly in-line revenue but weaker gross margins, and is still positioned to deliver a record Q4 as its factories continue to scale globally.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.3 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic; second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions.

Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)” 6.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) operates a technology platform that enables digital payments on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide. It is one of the famous stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio. On October 10, PayPal Holdings said that it has withdrawn a policy that would have seen users fined $2,500 for spreading misinformation. PayPal said that the policy update was published in error. A financial disclosure report shows that Pelosi exercised 50 CALL options (5,000 shares) on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock in January 2022 worth somewhere between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The report is dated late February 2022 and signed by the Speaker herself. On October 24, Atlantic Equities analyst Kunaal Malde maintained an Overweight rating on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $120, noting that given the increasing likelihood that the US and global economies will enter recession, the advisory was now assuming a modest economic downturn in 2023 forecasts.In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Mayar Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter, we bought shares in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the payments platform. PayPal has been one of the more high-profile victims of the market’s brutal ruthlessness over the past few months, and the stock fell by over two-thirds between its peak in July to the beginning of March this year. As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business.

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Arrowstreet Capital’s Stake Value: $169,519,000 Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -38%Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based financial technology company providing financial products and services. The company specializes in banking technology, payment technology, processing services, and information based services. Arrowstreet Capital owns 1.39 million Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) shares as of September 2021, worth $169.5 million, representing 0.21% of the fund’s 13F portfolio. Moshe Katri from the investment advisory Wedbush lowered the price target on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) to $130 from $182 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares, citing reduced consumer spending due to inflationary pressure on prices of staple goods. Here is what Baron FinTech Fund has to say about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. provides software to financial institutions and enables merchants to accept electronic payments. The company reported solid quarterly financial results that exceeded expectations and raised annual guidance for revenue and earnings. However, the stock fell due to concerns that Fidelity National’s legacy technology is losing market share to newer competitors with more modern technology. We believe these concerns are overblown and that Fidelity National remains well positioned to grow revenues organically at a high single-digit rate and earnings at a double-digit rate over time.”9. Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)Arrowstreet Capital’s Stake Value: $206,488,000 Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -37%Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), a New York-based alternative investment and private equity firm, is one of the top finance stocks to buy according to Arrowstreet Capital. The hedge fund elevated its position in Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) by 49% in the third quarter, holding a total of 1.77 million shares worth $206.4 million. Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Bedell raised the price target on Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to $190 from $152 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on December 17. The analyst heads into 2022 ""even more constructive than at the start of 2021"" on the brokers, asset managers, and exchanges sector.Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) as of September 2021, with 6.3 million shares worth $736.8 million. Overall, 54 hedge funds in the Q3 database of Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), valued at $2.5 billion. Here is what Artisan Value Fund has to say about Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Among our top Q3 contributors were Blackstone. Investment stalwart Blackstone’s virtuous cycle is in full swing. Throughout Blackstone’s history, excellent investment performance and capital protection have allowed the firm to increase fundraising in existing verticals as well as launch new endeavors. Historically, less than 10% of assets under management mature in any given year, and that number should move lower with continued growth in perpetual capital vehicles. Blackstone’s A+ rated balance sheet and capital-light model are the backbone of its 85% of cash flow distribution policy via a variable quarterly dividend. In short, this is a long-duration fee stream and robust capital-raising engine.”8. Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE)Arrowstreet Capital’s Stake Value: $238,200,000 Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -17%Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE) is an American financial company offering global exchanges, clearing houses, mortgage technology, financial data, and listing services.

(NYSE:ICE) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Intercontinental Exchange is one of the largest and, in our view, most successful financial exchange operators in the world. The company was created through a series of shrewd acquisitions executed by their founder and CEO Jeff Sprecher. Sprecher is one of the more capable CEOs we’ve evaluated, having demonstrated a long history of astute capital allocation and a willingness to act and adapt rapidly to new opportunities and competitive threats. Today, Intercontinental Exchange competes in three primary business segments: exchanges, fixed income/data services and mortgage technology. We believe each of these businesses exhibits attractive economic characteristics and that each should grow earnings well in excess of GDP over the long term. Despite this favorable long-term outlook, the company currently trades at a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the S&amp;P 500. We believe a business with Intercontinental Exchange’s strong competitive position, excellent management team and attractive growth outlook deserves to trade well above a market multiple. We like buying great businesses at average prices and believe Intercontinental Exchange represents a compelling opportunity to do just that.”7. Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS)Arrowstreet Capital’s Stake Value: $243,906,000 Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -5%Arrowstreet Capital elevated its position in Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) by 190% during Q3 2021, holding a total of 1.98 million shares of the company, worth $243.9 million, representing 0.30% of the fund’s 13F securities for the period.

The hedge fund boosted its stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) by 347% in the third quarter, holding more than 1 million shares of the company, worth $349.5 million, representing 0.43% of the total Q3 investments. Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev lowered the price target on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) to $400 from $465 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on January 7. Here is what Polen Capital has to say about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Mastercard faced pressure as some believe these “old payment infrastructure” businesses will be disrupted by newer fintech companies using blockchain, buy now, pay later (BNPL), or other innovations to provide better/cheaper payment services. However, we believe that some of these technologies have meaningful limitations which could benefit existing payment networks. For example, BNPL transactions are often funded with cards and turn a one-time transaction into many smaller ones with more transaction fees for Mastercard. Just like with regulation, we continually monitor for competition and technological disruption. As of now, we do not see a significant risk in the foreseeable future to this company.” Click to continue reading and see Was Arrowstreet Capital Right About These 5 Finance Stocks?   Suggested articles:10 Stocks That Will Make You RichGoldman Sachs Semiconductor StocksBest Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Fidelity National Information Services saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 8.0% per year, over the last three years. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 22% annual reduction in the share price. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Fidelity National Information Services has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, Fidelity National Information Services shareholders did even worse, losing 39% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 5% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for Aon as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Aon peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Aon.How Is Aon's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Aon's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 223% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 126% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 8.4% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.0% per annum, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Aon is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.The Bottom Line On Aon's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesOur examination of Aon's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Aon   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.You might be able to find a better investment than Aon.

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. That downside risk was realized by Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 45%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 17%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 8.3% in three years. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 27% in the last three months.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, Seagate Technology Holdings had to report a 22% decline in EPS over the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 45% share price fall. This suggests the EPS fall has made some shareholders are more nervous about the business. The P/E ratio of 9.80 also points to the negative market sentiment.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Seagate Technology Holdings' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Seagate Technology Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Seagate Technology Holdings shareholders are down 43% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 17%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 12% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Seagate Technology Holdings (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .Story continuesWe will like Seagate Technology Holdings better if we see some big insider buys.

Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Seagate due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Seagate Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Miss EstimatesSeagate has reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings of 48 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents.

The figure declined 35% on a year-over-year basis and fell 23% sequentially. Management had projected revenues of $2.1 billion (+/- 100 million) for the fiscal first quarter.Global macroeconomic weakness and significant inventory adjustments by customers and weakness in consumer spending acted as headwinds. Economic slowdowns and COVID lockdowns in China significantly affected mass capacity demand.Seagate is focused on cutting costs to better align with changing market conditions and support the company’s long-term business strategy. The company has announced a restructuring plan to reduce the global workforce by 8% or approximately 3,000 employees, along with other cost-saving initiatives.The above-mentioned plan is expected to complete by the end of fiscal second-quarter 2023 and result in pre-tax charges (cash-based employee severance and other one-time termination payments) between $60 and $70 million.The company anticipates realizing run-rate savings of about $110 million on an annualized basis beginning from the fiscal third quarter of 2023.Story continuesManagement anticipates second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $1.85 billion (+/- 150 million).Non-GAAP EPS for the fiscal second quarter is expected to be 15 cents per share (+/- 20 cents).Exabyte Shipments in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Seagate shipped 118.2 exabytes of hard disk drive (“HDD”) storage.

On a sequential basis, revenues were down 26%.Non-HDD segment revenues (12.9%), including enterprise data solutions, cloud systems and SSDs, were $263 million. This figure improved 5% on a year-over-year basis and 21% sequentially.Margin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin contracted 650 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 24.5%.Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 7% on a year-over-year basis to $314 million.Non-GAAP income from operations totaled $184 million, down 70.7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.

The dividend will be paid out on Jan 5, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Dec 21, 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -95.08% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Seagate has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Paccar has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PCAR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.99, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 45.19. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.30. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.44.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.86. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 14.21.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PCAR's Value grade of B and TSLA's Value grade of C.PCAR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, sold US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$154). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.All up, insiders sold more shares in American Express than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).American Express Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at American Express. We can see that insider Walter Clayton paid US$149k for shares in the company. No-one sold. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. American Express insiders own about US$132m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The American Express Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. The high levels of insider ownership, and the recent buying by an insider suggests they are well aligned and optimistic. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing American Express. For example - American Express has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

If you want to read about some more Nancy Pelosi stocks, go directly to 5 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy Now.The stock trading activities of lawmakers in the United States have always made for interesting case studies. This is because a sizable number of US lawmakers engage in stock trading. Until the past few years, making large amounts of money from these trades was considered a side-benefit of winning a seat in the US Congress. In order to make these trades more transparent, the STOCK Act of April 2012 was passed, requiring lawmakers to disclose their stock trading through a Periodic Transaction Report within 45 days of the transaction.  Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since 2019, is one of the most active stock traders in the US Congress. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, runs a venture capital firm. Some of the top stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio include prominent names like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Lately, Pelosi has been quietly buying the dip on tech stocks that have witnessed a large correction in their prices due to rising interest rates. Our MethodologyThe companies listed below were picked from the Periodic Transaction Report(s) that US politicians who trade stocks are obliged to file. It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public record of investments Nancy Pelosi and her family have made in the past few months. The purchases may not have been made by Pelosi herself but only disclosed on behalf of her husband, Paul Pelosi, who runs a venture capital firm. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.12 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy NowBest Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy Now12.

Here is what the fund said:“Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) got significantly more attention from both institutional &amp; retail investors after Facebook announced to rename itself as Meta Platforms. I believe the price appreciation is largely attributed to the increased attention. On the business side, Roblox rolled out a few successful music events and also partnered with Netflix on testing long-form media consumption in the virtual world. Apple in its iOS 14.5 rolled out an impactful change for the digital advertising landscape by requiring all apps to ask users to “opt-in”.10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68   American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provides charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services. It is one of the major stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio. On October 18, Simon Property Group and fintech firm Cardless revealed that they have agreed to introduce a credit card of American Express which gives their users up to 3% cash back on eligible purchases made at Simon’s shopping malls.

Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise amid a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”9. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.1 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems.

The strike price was $500 and the options were due to expire on March 18. On October 20, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner maintained a Buy rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $355 from $390, noting that the company reported a Q3 earnings miss compared to expectations, with mostly in-line revenue but weaker gross margins, and is still positioned to deliver a record Q4 as its factories continue to scale globally.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.3 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic; second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions.

Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)” 6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 PayPal Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the stocks in the Nancy Pelosi stock portfolio.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Mayar Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter, we bought shares in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the payments platform. PayPal has been one of the more high-profile victims of the market’s brutal ruthlessness over the past few months, and the stock fell by over two-thirds between its peak in July to the beginning of March this year. As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business.

Shares have added about 16.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FMC Technologies due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.TechnipFMC Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Lag EstimatesTechnipFMC reported reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. This underperformance was due to lower-than-expected sales in the reported quarter and higher costs and expenses.Adjusted EBITDA from the Subsea unit for the reported quarter totaled $183.8 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $172 million. Meanwhile, the Surface Technologies unit’s profit came in at $40.8 million, underperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.36 million.For the quarter ended Sep 30, this seabed-to-surface oilfield equipment and services provider’s revenues of $1.73 billion marginally underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 billion, primarily due to lower-than-expected revenues from the Surface Technologies segment. However, revenues increased from the year-ago quarter’s $1.58 billion. This could be attributed to better-than-anticipated revenues of the Subsea unit.Giving some respite to investors, FTI’s third-quarter inbound orders increased by 35.4% from the year-ago period’s level to $1.85 billion, reflecting strong revenue visibility.Also, the company’s backlog rose. As of September end, TechnipFMC’s order backlog stood at $8.84 billion, improving by about 26.3% from the 2021 reading.Segment AnalysisSubsea:  Revenues in the quarter under review were $1.41 billion, up 1.46% from the year-ago sales figure of $1.31 billion due to higher project installation activity in Brazil and Guyana. Adjusted EBITDA was reported at $183.8 million, up by about 25.5% from the year-ago quarter’s level due to improved margins in the backlog and increased installation activity. The quarterly inbound orders jumped 25.5% to $1.4 billion, while the backlog rose 14.1%.Story continuesSurface Technologies:  This smaller segment of the company recorded revenues of $318 million, up 19% year over year due to revenue growth globally, with particular strength in the Middle East.Moreover, the unit’s adjusted EBITDA increased by 43.7% to $40.8 million due to higher international activity, including the progressive ramp-up in the Middle East volume and the timing of associated costs. The segment’s inbound orders rose significantly by about 79.8%, while the quarter-end backlog increased by 263%.FinancialsIn the reported quarter, TechnipFMC spent $30.9 million on capital programs. As of Sep 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $711.5 million and long-term debt of $1.13 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 26.3%.2022 OutlookTechnipFMC retained revenue expectations from the Subsea unit in the $5.2-$5.6 billion range for 2022 and maintained the Surface Technologies unit’s 2022 revenue guidance between $1.15 and $1.30 billion.This London-based oilfield services provider maintained its free cash flow projection for 2022, which is expected in the $100-$250 million band.The company updated its annual capital expenditure guidance from $230 million to $180 million for 2022 but stuck to its earlier net interest expense outlook in the band of $105-$115 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -21.98% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, FMC Technologies has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, FMC Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerFMC Technologies belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT), has gained 1.8% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Liberty Oilfield Services reported revenues of $1.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81.8%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with -$0.22 a year ago.Liberty Oilfield Services is expected to post earnings of $0.70 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +333.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.7%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Liberty Oilfield Services.

229,2feb8e03-a362-3b8f-bcef-1b67acc18e14,PPL,2022-11-26,Analyst Report: PPL Corporation,Morningstar Research,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2feb8e03-a362-3b8f-bcef-1b67acc18e14/analyst-report%3A-ppl.html,1669420100,STORY,['PPL'],[]
230,65020a0d-9056-3426-9fb6-d3afb75882d8,PPL,2022-11-26,PPL Corporation's (NYSE:PPL) Stock Going Strong But Fundamentals Look Weak: What Implications Could This Have On The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppl-corporations-nyse-ppl-stock-173532633.html,1669397732,STORY,['PPL'],"[Most readers would already be aware that PPL's (NYSE:PPL) stock increased significantly by 12% over the past month. However, we decided to pay close attention to its weak financials as we are doubtful that the current momentum will keep up, given the scenario. In this article, we decided to focus on PPL's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for PPL How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PPL is:5.1% = US$708m ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.05 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.PPL's Earnings Growth And 5.1% ROEWhen you first look at it, PPL's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 9.1%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 30% seen by PPL was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared PPL's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 7.7% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is PPL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PPL is currently mispriced by the market.Is PPL Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?PPL's high three-year median payout ratio of 151% suggests that the company is depleting its resources to keep up its dividend payments, and this shows in its shrinking earnings. Its usually very hard to sustain dividend payments that are higher than reported profits. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for PPL by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Additionally, PPL has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 60% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 8.8%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning PPL. The low ROE, combined with the fact that the company is paying out almost if not all, of its profits as dividends, has resulted in the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

232,1af8fac6-1fd8-30e0-9bf6-5f0bab7a538e,OXY,2022-11-26,"With 58% institutional ownership, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/58-institutional-ownership-occidental-petroleum-140023665.html,1669384823,STORY,['OXY'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 58% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Occidental Petroleum. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Occidental Petroleum. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Occidental Petroleum's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 6.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, Dodge &amp; Cox and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 6 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$136m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 21% of Occidental Petroleum stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share, indicating a change of +43.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +289.4%. This estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.89 indicates a change of -20.5% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $37.66 billion and $34.25 billion estimates indicate +43.1% and -9.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental.

Shares have added about 5.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Boston Scientific due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Boston Scientific Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, Operating Margin GrowsBoston Scientific posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents for the third quarter of 2022, which marked a 4.9% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The reported figure matches the lower end of the adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 43-45 cents. The quarter’s adjustments included certain amortization expenses, intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestitures-related net charges, and restructuring charges among others.Reported EPS in the third quarter was 12 cents, a 57.1% drop from the year-ago quarter’s 28 cents per share.Revenues of $3.17 billion in the third quarter improved 8.1% year over year on a reported basis and 13.7% on an operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER). Revenues grew 11.5% on an organic basis (adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations and certain recent acquisitions and divestments). The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%. The quarter’s top-line performance also exceeded the company’s projection of organic revenue growth of approximately 8-10%.Q3 Revenues in DetailIn the third quarter, revenues rose 12% in the United States on a reported basis (same operationally). Revenues were down 0.8% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (up 15.2%) but rose 2.8% in the Asia Pacific zone (up 15.3%). Revenues increased 20.4% in Latin America and Canada (up 24.2%) and 28.1% in emerging markets (up 40%).Story continuesSegmental AnalysisBoston Scientific recently reorganized its operational structure and aggregated its core businesses, each of which generates revenues from the sale of Medical Devices, into two reportable segments, MedSurg and Cardiovascular.The company generates maximum revenues from Cardiovascular. Sales from its sub-segments, Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions were $1.48 billion (up 12.8% year over year organically) and $479 million (up 12%), respectively, in the third quarter.Within MedSurg, Endoscopy generated revenues of $559 million, up 10.4% organically. Urology and Pelvic Health revenues were $433 million, reflecting organic growth of 12.6%. Neuromodulation within MedSurg reported $221 million in revenues, reflecting a 3.2% rise organically year over year.MarginsGross margin in the third quarter contracted 19 basis points (bps) year over year to 69.1%. There was an 8.8% rise in the cost of products sold to $979 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 6.2% to $1.13 billion. Research and development expenses rose 9.4% to $339 million. Royalty expenses of $11 million declined 21.4% year over year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 47 bps to 22.4% in the reported quarter.2022 GuidanceBoston Scientific updated full-year 2022 guidance and also provided guidance for the fourth quarter.Full-year net sales growth expectation has been narrowed to 6.5% (previously 6.5-7.5%) on a reported basis. However, net sales growth is now expected at 9% (previously 8-9%) on an organic basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $12.71 billion, indicating a 6.9% rise from the 2021 reported figure. The lower end of the full-year adjusted EPS was reduced to $1.71 to $1.74 ($1.74 to $1.77 expected previously). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 remains above the guided range.For the fourth quarter of 2022, revenue growth is projected in the range of approximately 2-4% on a reported basis (an increase of 7-9% organically). Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of 45-48 cents per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at 48 cents and $3.31 billion, respectively.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Boston Scientific has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerBoston Scientific is part of the Zacks Medical - Products industry. Over the past month, Royal Philips (PHG), a stock from the same industry, has gained 12.4%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Philips reported revenues of $4.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.4%. EPS of $0.25 for the same period compares with $0.47 a year ago.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

237,096f42d0-6345-3bb7-bceb-4dbbf82c25a0,VRTX,2022-11-26,Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robust-financials-driving-recent-rally-110057203.html,1669460457,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 11% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:25% = US$3.3b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.25.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has an impressive ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 25% the company's ROE is pretty decent. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 29% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Vertex Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 28% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is VRTX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

The benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index is down 16% year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite plunged 29%.But you don’t necessarily need a rallying market to make money in stocks — you can also collect dividends.Healthy dividend stocks have the potential to:Offer a plump income stream in both good times and bad times.Provide much-needed diversification to growth-oriented portfolios.Outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the long haul.To be sure, if you want to live 100% off dividends, you should look for more than just the highest-yielding names. Dividends are not carved in stone. When times get tough, dividends can and do get cut.Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger heavy demand for this physical asset — get in now before the super-rich swarmBut some companies have the ability to return generous amounts of cash to investors through thick and thin.Better yet, some companies have consistently raised their dividends over time.Here’s a look at three of them. Wall Street also sees upside in this trio.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.Story continuesMore impressively, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. The stock currently yields 2.8%.UBS analyst Peter Grom has a ‘buy’ rating on Coca-Cola and a price target of $68 — roughly 9% above where the stock sits today.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)When it comes to delivering recession-proof returns, few companies have done a better job than healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson.The stock has been trending up for decades and for good reason. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s business grows consistently through economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted EPS has increased at a steady pace of 8% annually.And that means shareholders can look forward to higher dividends every year.JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford has an ‘outperform’ rating on JNJ and a price target of $185 — around 5% above the current levels.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble has an even longer dividend growth track record than Coca-Cola and Johnson &amp; Johnson: the company has raised its payout to shareholders for 66 consecutive years.That streak is a testament to its entrenched position in the consumer staples market. P&amp;G has a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades and Tide detergent.These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing. As a result, the company can deliver reliable dividends even in tough times.The latest dividend hike was announced in April, when the board of directors approved a 5% increase to the quarterly payout to 91.33 cents per share. The stock currently yields 2.5%.Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy has a ‘buy’ rating on Procter &amp; Gamble and recently raised his price target from $149 to $164. That implies a potential upside of 12%.Looking for a bigger idea?Of course, not every investor needs steady income. Some people want juicier upside — and they want it outside of the stock market.There’s an overlooked ‘passion asset’ that has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 131% over the past 26 years — with lower volatility.According to Forbes, it’s a “compelling option” for those looking to diversify.And Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs says it can “protect purchasing power” when inflation is hot.Investing in this shockproof asset used to be an option only for the ultra-rich.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +5.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 8.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.52 indicates a change of +1.6% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $42.78 billion and $43.46 billion estimates indicate +10.7% and +1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke.

Jakafi is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (“PV”) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. It is also approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The drug is also approved in the United States for treating steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years or older.Demand for the drug has witnessed a steady increase over the last few quarters due to continued label expansions.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis NVS as Jakavi (ruxolitinib) outside the United States. Incyte also earns product royalty revenues from Novartis for the commercialization of Jakafi in non-U.S. markets.Incyte’s pipeline is highly encouraging and the approval of new drugs diversifies the company’s pipeline. The approval of pemigatinib, a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with previously-treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangements as detected by an FDA-approved test, has broadened the portfolio. The drug has been approved under the brand name, Pemazyre, and the initial uptake of the drug has been encouraging.Earlier in the year, the FDA approved a label expansion of Pemazyre for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 rearrangement.Story continuesThe approval of Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of ruxolitinib, for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients aged 12 years or older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when such therapies are not advisable, has strengthened the portfolio. Per the company, over 62,000 units of Opzelura were shipped in the third quarter, with growth fueled by both AD and vitiligo.Incyte continues to expand the development of ruxolitinib cream into new indications, which should fuel the growth potential of the drug. Two phase II trials evaluating ruxolitinib cream in lichen planus and lichen sclerosus are in preparation.The adoption of other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi is also a positive and should boost sales in the upcoming quarters.INCY also receives product royalty revenues from Eli Lilly LLY for Olumiant (baricitinib). The drug is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly. It is also approved for the treatment of adults with moderate- to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Recent label expansions will propel the top line further and generate more royalties for INCY.However, increasing competition for Jakafi is a concern. The company is highly dependent on its lead drug Jakafi for a major chunk of its revenues and a slowdown will adversely impact sales.Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the biotech space is Syndax Pharmaceuticals SNDX, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Over the past 60 days, loss estimates for Syndax have narrowed to $2.59 from $2.68.

Therefore, if you purchase Waste Management's shares on or after the 1st of December, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 16th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.65 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.60 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Waste Management stock has a trailing yield of around 1.6% on the current share price of $164.46. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Waste Management can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Waste Management If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Waste Management paid out a comfortable 47% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 53% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Waste Management's earnings per share have risen 15% per annum over the last five years. Waste Management is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Waste Management has delivered an average of 6.2% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Waste Management an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Waste Management paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Waste Management, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $2.5 billion, up 24.42% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.70 per share and revenue of $14.51 billion.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Stryker’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker Is Stryker Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 6.2% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Stryker today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $248.12, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Stryker’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Stryker look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 45% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Stryker. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SYK’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SYK, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

However, pricing pressure remains a headwind.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 13.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 45% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 16.6% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $87.15 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 8.8% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.98% compares favorably with the industry’s (3.32%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book, courtesy of the platform’s unique features, despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. These, in turn, position it well to sustain momentum in robot sales.Stryker is committed to the continued expansion of Mako. Although the company saw softening in Mako installation during the third quarter due to variability in the hospital environment, it expects strong demand in the fourth quarter. The company continues to focus on the continued expansion of the platform. This growth reflects the demand for Stryker’s differentiated Mako robotic technology.Taking into account the normalization of the customer environment, management anticipates another strong year for Mako in 2022. The company’s Mako order book remains solid for 2022 and is in sync with its aim of continued share gains in both hips and knees.Additionally, Stryker has a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products shields the company against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil. Its significant exposure to robotics, artificial intelligence for health care and Medical Mechatronics has helped the company stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. Stryker’s portfolio includes products like Hip, Knee and Mako robotic-arm assisted surgeries.Story continuesOn its third-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries, after getting adversely impacted last year due to COVID. The company stated that it is reaching normalized levels across most of its business. Moreover, it expects hospital staffing pressure to resolve gradually, leading to higher procedures in 2023.Per management, the company’s sustained support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the pandemic subsides. In the third quarter of 2022, Stryker’s adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 7.1% of net sales, highlighting its sustained commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches. In September, Stryker launched its new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System — for spine application. The company received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its OptaBlate bone tumor ablation system in the same month.Moreover, Stryker’s action to lessen the inflationary pressure and cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins look promising. The 9.2% year-over-year decline in SG&amp;A expenses during the third quarter was probably due to these actions, implying that margins may improve going forward.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable pricing environment poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the period’s average selling days were in line with third-quarter 2021. The impact from pricing was 0.7% in the last reported quarter. Consequently, pricing pressure remains a cause of concern. Moreover, unfavorable currency rate fluctuation has also hurt top-line growth, which may continue to impact revenues moderately in 2023.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteEstimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $9.17 and $9.83, respectively, suggesting year-over-year growth of 0.9% and 7.3%.

Its process gas, like hydrogen, is being utilized for clean fuels, while its high-purity and specialty gases are employed to manufacture electronics. Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows.The firm reported strong third-quarter results, owing to increased prices and volumes across all end markets, except for healthcare. However, the cost of sales continues to increase, hurting the firm's bottom line.

While supply chains have started easing, they still remain a headwind, as are the new export restrictions to China. The company's weak outlook for the fourth quarter shows signs of deteriorating chip demand. This remains a major concern. Further, softness in the personal electronics and industrial end-markets remains an overhang.However, the continued rebound in the automotive market was a tailwind. Growing momentum across the communication equipment and enterprise systems markets drove the results further.  Additionally, strong performance of Analog and Embedded Processing segments contributed well. Solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Trane Technologies have declined -8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Technology Services industry's decline of -62.4%.

The stock rose 3.1%, resulting in a US$2.9b rise in the company's market capitalisation. In other words, the original US$5.5m purchase is now worth US$6.5m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp bought US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$88.14. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 73.54k shares worth US$5.5m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. In total, General Electric insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeGeneral Electric is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. General Electric insiders own about US$235m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At General Electric Tell Us?The fact that there have been no General Electric insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, General Electric insiders feel good about the company's future. Of course, the future is what matters most.

We are publishing this article today because it’s always interesting for the readers to analyze how good the so-called “smart money” is when it comes to stock picking. When we look at the stock picks/sells of hedge funds in hindsight, we can better analyze their performance and see whether they were right or wrong.In this article you will see the top 10 stock picks of Alexander West's Blue Pool Capital as of the third quarter of last year.To assess the performance of these stocks and the hedge fund, we have mentioned their performance over the past 12 months through November 25.At the time of writing we had mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks from famous Wall Street analysts. It’d be interesting for our readers to see how right or wrong were these analysts’ price targets and calls.However, we should keep the 2022 market crash in mind when reading this article.

We added Thermo Fisher Scientific to increase our exposure to health care tools, which has been an attractive and core segment within health care. Thermo Fisher’s instruments are used to monitor and protect air, water, and food quality, and the company has strong long-term fundamentals, a top-tier management team and a diversified business.”9. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)Blue Pool Capital’s Stake Value: $23,834,000Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -7.9%Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), a Connecticut-based travel technology company, is one of the best stocks to buy according to Alexander West's Blue Pool Capital.

(NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We reinvested the proceeds from our successful investment in Thermo Fisher in Booking Holdings (Booking). Booking was an investment in the Fund at Inception and was featured in our inaugural June 2019 Quarterly Report. The company owns the world’s largest online travel agent (OTA), Booking.com. To say the past 2.5 years has been volatile for Booking is a major understatement. Booking’s management has had to address the COVID-19-driven collapse in demand for travel accommodation, as well as to manage volatile demand as the world gradually recovers, interrupted by second and third waves of COVID-19 as variants arise.Throughout these volatile market conditions, Booking’s management has executed against a consistent strategy, investing in its platform and network of accommodation providers, and expanding its associated services while improving efficiencies. We believe Booking will come out of the COVID-19 environment a stronger business, with less competition and consumers more predisposed to booking their travel accommodation online. Travel is recovering strongly as vaccination rates increase and COVID-19 related restrictions are lifted, and we expect Booking’s earnings and cash flow to also recover strongly over the coming years.”8.

We initiated our position during the 2020 Presidential election at a time of heightened political and regulatory uncertainty.We believe under its new CEO, Andrew Witty, UnitedHealth can not only preserve its market dominance and sustain industry-leading growth rates across most of its key segments but also enter new healthcare services markets. Witty is known as a mission-driven CEO who clearly articulates his view that providing high-quality, affordable health care services is a social good. He receives consistently high marks from former colleagues, and we believe that his leadership approach will ballast and even strengthen UNH’s already impressive management and employee ranks. The insurance and services businesses are synergistic and complementary, which entrenches United’s critical role in care financing, access, and management. This dynamic gives us confidence in the durability of United’s market leadership…” (Click here to see the full text)6. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)Blue Pool Capital’s Stake Value: $37,736,000Stock performance over the past 12 months through November 25: -66%Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:FB)’s spending on the Metaverse over the next several years and how rapidly the spending at Facebook Reality Labs will increase from the $10 billion already spent in 2021. Here is what Canterbury Tollgate has to say about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“To say traditional media is anti-Facebook would not be an overstatement. An already intense and multi-year critique of (or attack on) Facebook has ratcheted up in recent weeks. Facebook’s research efforts have been reported on, if often derided, for nearly a decade. Going back to 2014, Slate.com called their research practices “unethical” when FB tried to study the impact social posts had on users. Now those efforts have been turned against them for the kill shot.My job is to observe, assess, and allocate. Not to commentate on all the whims and wishes of media narrative. However, in the case of Facebook I cannot avoid going into some detail re: the onslaught against them, which I find to be most unwarranted and insincere.Last month the Wall Street Journal ran a five-piece series titled “The Facebook Files” which allegedly shows how toxic Instagram is for teens. The foundation of their argument was a single slide from an internal presentation claiming, based on FB’s own research, that of teens who had a negative self-image, one-third said Instagram “made them feel worse.”iii Somehow the implication here is that this is not an inescapable aspect of either the human psyche and/or society-at large, but that it is of Facebook’s doing…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see Was Alexander West's Blue Pool Capital Right About These 5 Stocks?   Suggested articles:11 Best Bitcoin Stocks To BuyGoldman Sachs Dividend Stocks10 Undervalued European Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic; second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)9.

We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China.

(NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/price-automatic-data-processing-inc-140106597.html,1669384866,STORY,['ADP'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 36x Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Automatic Data Processing certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing peKeen to find out how analysts think Automatic Data Processing's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Automatic Data Processing's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 14% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 34% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 12% each year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Automatic Data Processing is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.As we suspected, our examination of Automatic Data Processing's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Automatic Data Processing  that you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

This led to better-than-expected top and bottom lines in first-quarter fiscal 2023. PG reported net sales of $20,612 million, increasing 1% year over year.On an organic basis (excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues improved 7%, backed by a 9% rise in pricing and a 1% gain from a positive product mix, offset by a 3% decline in volume. All the company’s business segments reported growth in organic sales. Organic sales rose 4% for Beauty, 5% for Grooming, 8% each for Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Health Care segments, and 6% for the Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segment.Procter &amp; Gamble is focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. Continued investment in business, and efforts to offset macro cost headwinds and balance top and bottom-line growth underscore its productivity efforts. PG is witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of its business.As a result, it expects $800 million worth COGS savings this year. PG’s core currency-neutral gross margin reflected a 100-bps gain from productivity savings in first-quarter fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral basis, the operating margin expanded 10 bps to 24.8%, driven by gross productivity savings of 230 bps.Driven by these factors, management anticipates organic sales growth of 3-5% in fiscal 2023. In the past three months, shares of this presently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 3.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 3.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite these upsides, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation of late, which are hurting consumer confidence. PG anticipates all-in sales between down 3% and down 1% from the last fiscal year’s level for fiscal 2023 compared with flat to up 2% sales growth expected earlier.Currency movements are expected to negatively impact all-in sales growth 6% compared with the 3% impact projected earlier. Management expects reported EPS to be at the lower end of flat to up 4% due to the increased adverse currency impacts.Additionally, higher commodity and freight costs dented margins in the fiscal first quarter. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, Procter &amp; Gamble’s gross margin contracted 160 basis points (bps) to 47.4%. The currency-neutral gross margin declined 130 bps to 47.7%. The decline in the gross margin was mainly due to a 510-bps commodity and input material cost inflation, reflecting a 40-bps increase in freight costs, a 130-bps negative product mix and other impacts, and a 30-bps headwind from product and packaging investments. Also, the operating margin declined 70 bps from the prior fiscal-year level to 24%. Consequently, core earnings of $1.57 per share declined 2% from $1.61 in the year-ago fiscal quarter.Procter &amp; Gamble’s fiscal 2023 earnings view considers after-tax impacts of $1.3 billion related to unfavorable currency movements, a $2.4-billion impact of higher commodity and material costs, and a $200-million impact from higher freight costs. This equates to a $3.9-billion after-tax impact on net income, implying a $1.57-per-share impact on EPS or a 23-percentage-point impact on EPS growth. The revised $3.9-billion headwinds mark a $600-million increase from management’s prior view of $3.3 billion.Story continuesConclusionDespite cost headwinds and rising inflation, solid demand, brand strength and productivity efforts bode well and will likely help PG stay afloat. Also, a long-term earnings growth rate of 6% raises optimism on the stock.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, e.l.f.

(NYSE:DHI) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-d-r-horton-130416170.html,1669467856,STORY,['DHI'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase D.R. Horton's shares on or after the 1st of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, D.R. Horton has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current stock price of $83.89. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether D.R. Horton has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. D.R. Horton has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 5.4% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 77% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's positive to see that D.R. Horton's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see D.R. Horton's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 44% per annum for the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, D.R. Horton has increased its dividend at approximately 21% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineShould investors buy D.R. Horton for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, D.R. Horton paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. D.R. Horton looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks D.R. Horton is facing. Be aware that D.R. Horton is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those make us uncomfortable...If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

In 2021, FBHS’s cost of sales increased 25% year over year despite its cost-reduction initiatives. In the first nine months of 2022, cost of sales climbed 7.1% year over year. Rising cost of sales poses a threat to FBHS’ bottom line. Despite focusing on supply-chain optimization, FBHS is facing constraints on that front and labor shortage.Slowdown in the US new construction activity due to inflation and rising interest rates is weighing on Fortune Brands’ operations. Due to this headwind and channel-inventory reductions, FBHS lowered its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts. FBHS expects sales to increase 4.5-5.5% from the year-ago reading in 2022 compared with a rise of 6.5-7.5% anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be $6.20-$6.30 per share in 2022 compared with $6.36-$6.50 predicted earlier.Persistent weakness in the Water Innovations segment due to inventory destocking and COVID-related shutdowns in China is also weighing on Fortune Brands’ shares.

268,49afb812-57b9-3ccd-a41f-78eaf5fa8b45,ORLY,2022-11-26,Pick These 4 Stocks With Exciting Interest Coverage Ratio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-4-stocks-exciting-interest-123512916.html,1669379712,STORY,"['TXRH', 'GILD', 'GIS', 'ORLY']","[An ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only on the basis of the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues, such as soaring inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and a hawkish monetary policy.Often, investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play — the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.General Mills, Inc. GIS, Texas Roadhouse, Inc. TXRH, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY and Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks with a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:General Mills, which manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B. Its expected EPS growth rate for three-five years is 7.5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills' current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 2.7% and 3.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period. GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.1%, on average. The stock has rallied 31.9% in the past year.Texas Roadhouse, which operates casual dining restaurants, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.

269,e4a1f079-757e-3ad7-8a4b-b403869164b2,ETN,2022-11-26,Those who invested in Eaton (NYSE:ETN) five years ago are up 147%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-eaton-nyse-etn-130038119.html,1669467638,STORY,['ETN'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) share price has soared 114% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Eaton While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Eaton's earnings per share are down 2.0% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.We doubt the modest 2.0% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. The revenue reduction of 2.1% per year is not a positive. It certainly surprises us that the share price is up, but perhaps a closer examination of the data will yield answers.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthEaton is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Eaton will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Eaton the TSR over the last 5 years was 147%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Eaton has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 1.3% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 20% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Eaton better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Eaton  that you should be aware of.Of course Eaton may not be the best stock to buy.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Eaton Corporation plc (ETN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Exxon Mobil shares have handily outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+85.5% vs. +55.6%). The company’s bellwether status and optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.The firm has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015. ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it expects to boost production volumes by 25% in 2022. The energy major has significantly lower debt exposure than composite players belonging to the industry. XOM recently reported strong third-quarter earnings owing to higher prices and production, and strong refining margins.However, the company has been constantly bearing the brunt of increasing expenses, adversely affecting the income. Also, the aggressive capital budget remains a headwind for the company. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Exxom Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Meta Platforms have been laggards this year, with the market unhappy with management's spending plans on the metaverse given the uncertain pay off from the project over the near to medium term. On top of the metaverse spending issue is the weak outlook for digital ad spending in the current uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Unfavorable forex, targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes, normalization of e-commerce after the pandemic peak and higher inflation hurt growth in the reported quarter.User base in Europe declined in the reported quarter. Meta’s fourth-quarter guidance reflects macroeconomic and forex concerns. Weak advertising demand is a headwind. Meta expects Reels to monetize much slower than feed or stories.Story continuesHowever, Meta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Eaton have declined -1.3% over the past year against the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry’s decline of -10.2%. The company’s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, cyber-attacks and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.However, Eaton’s third-quarter earnings per share were better than expected. ETN’s research and development investments allowed it to develop products for providing efficient power management solutions to customers.The spin-off of non-core businesses and acquisitions will allow Eaton to further expand operations. Eaton's strategy to manufacture in the zone of sale has helped it reduce costs. Strong cash flow is supporting the company in debt reduction and dividend payments.(You can read the full research report on Eaton here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ), Keysight Technologies, Inc.

271,cfdb5bcf-a245-3e56-b91e-ad215ebda5bb,AFL,2022-11-26,Investors in Aflac (NYSE:AFL) have made a respectable return of 85% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-aflac-nyse-afl-made-191640499.html,1669403800,STORY,['AFL'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Aflac share price has climbed 64% in five years, easily topping the market return of 45% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 30% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Aflac While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Aflac managed to grow its earnings per share at 19% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 8.86 also suggests market apprehension.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Aflac has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Aflac's TSR for the last 5 years was 85%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Aflac shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Aflac better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Aflac (including 1 which is significant) .Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

272,936ba7bc-38e4-3be8-83ac-b794a49edc74,PEP,2022-11-26,"Should Income Investors Look At PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Before Its Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-look-pepsico-inc-125550573.html,1669467350,STORY,['PEP'],"[Readers hoping to buy PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase PepsiCo's shares before the 1st of December in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of January.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.15 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.60 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, PepsiCo has a trailing yield of approximately 2.5% on its current stock price of $184.11. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether PepsiCo can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. PepsiCo paid out 63% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 95% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.While PepsiCo's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were PepsiCo to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see PepsiCo earnings per share are up 9.7% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, PepsiCo has increased its dividend at approximately 8.4% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineShould investors buy PepsiCo for the upcoming dividend? PepsiCo is paying out a reasonable percentage of its income and an uncomfortably high 95% of its cash flow as dividends. At least earnings per share have been growing steadily. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of PepsiCo don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for PepsiCo that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold US$7.0m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-regn-110053351.html,1669460453,STORY,['REGN'],"[In the last year, many Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Regeneron PharmaceuticalsThe Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$622 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$736, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 26% of Arthur Ryan's stake.Insiders in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, currently worth about US$3.3b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

REGN is having a good run, with shares gaining 16.4% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 19.7%.In fact, Regeneron is one of the few companies that has been outperforming the biotech industry in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron recently delivered better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 results, driven by growth in lead drug Eylea (aflibercept) and its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent.The top growth driver, Eylea, approved for various ophthalmology indications, has been a consistent performer for Regeneron and should maintain momentum on sustained label expansions.Regeneron had earlier announced that the two studies evaluating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens in patients with diabetic macular edema and wet age-related macular degeneration were successful. The company is evaluating a higher dose of aflibercept with less frequent injections in the targeted population. The results impressed investors.Regeneron is jointly developing aflibercept 8 mg with Bayer AG BAYRY. While REGN records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Another growth driver in Regeneron’s armory is Dupixent, for which it has a collaboration with Sanofi SNY. Solid sales of Dupixent (approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis) have boosted the top line significantly. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while REGN records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of the drug.Regeneron is also looking to diversify in the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Story continuesThe European Commission recently approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo for another indication. The drug has been approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The FDA approved Libtayo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations.Regeneron has approximately 35 product candidates in clinical development, including a number of approved drugs for which it is investigating additional indications.Growth in Eylea and Dupixent through further penetration in existing indications and a promising late-stage pipeline set the momentum for growth.However, stiff competition from the potential entry of generics and new treatment options weigh on Eylea. While Libtayo holds promise, competition is stiff in this oncology space with many formidable drugs.The contribution from REGEN-COV, a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab) — for COVID-19 has seen a massive decline in 2022 from 2021, thereby pulling down year-over-year growth.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In that same time, the Transportation sector gained 11.37%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 6.23%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Union Pacific as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.85, up 7.14% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.37 billion, up 11.05% from the year-ago period.UNP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $11.52 per share and revenue of $25.06 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +15.78% and +14.94%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Union Pacific. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Union Pacific is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Union Pacific has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.44 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.25.Story continuesMeanwhile, UNP's PEG ratio is currently 1.84.

However, high operating costs, mainly due to elevated fuel expenses, are hurting its bottom line. Currently, UNP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Let’s delve deeper.Union Pacific hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In the first nine months of 2022, UNP returned $7.86 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($2.4 billion) and share repurchases ($5.4 billion). Management anticipates share repurchases in 2022 to be $6.5 billion. Additionally, UNP expects a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings) in the long term.The uptick in overall volumes as labor woes ease is a bonus. In November, management stated at the Stephens 2022 Annual Investment Conference that overall volumes for the December quarter were up 4% (data as of Nov 11) year over year. Segmentwise, volumes at the bulk division were up 1% year over year. Fourth-quarter volumes at the industrial and premium segments are up 4% and 7%, respectively, year over year as of Nov 11.However, higher fuel costs due to a spike in oil price are limiting bottom-line growth. In 2021, fuel expenses increased 56% year over year to $2,049 million at Union Pacific. In the first nine months of 2022, costs of the same commodity escalated 78%, inducing a 22% increase in operating costs.Due to high costs and economic uncertainty, the full-year guidance for the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated. A lower value of the metric is desirable. UNP now expects the 2022 operating ratio to be around 60%. Earlier, the expectation was around 58%.We are also concerned about Union Pacific's high-debt levels. Debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio (adjusted) at Union Pacific increased to 2.9 at the end of the first nine months of 2022 from 2.7 at 2021 end. A high debt/EBITDA ratio often indicates a firm’s inefficiency in servicing its debt appropriately.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation sector are as follows:Covenant Logistics CVLG: CVLG offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, besides asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.The gradually improving freight market scenario is a tailwind to Covenant.

Shares have added about 18.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SEI due for a pullback?

The bottom line, however, reflects a decline of 21% from the prior-year quarter.Higher revenues aided SEIC’s quarterly results. However, a rise in expenses and a fall in assets under management balance were headwinds.The company’s CEO, Ryan Hicke, noted, “All of our markets are facing a changing landscape, and while this change is challenging, we believe it reinforces growth opportunity for SEI.”The results in the reported quarter excluded one-time costs of the voluntary separation program. After considering this, net income was $61.7 million, down 55% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues &amp; AUM Down, Expenses RiseTotal revenues were $471.3 million, down 3% year over year. The fall was due to lower asset management, administration and distribution fees, partly offset by an increase in information processing and software servicing fees. The top line, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $459.4 million.Total expenses were $420.3 million, which jumped 22%. The rise was mainly due to an increase in compensation, benefits and other personnel costs, data processing and computer-related expenses, consulting, outsourcing and professional fees and facilities, supplies and other costs.Operating income plunged 64% year over year to $51 million.As of Sep 30, 2022, AUM was $378.2 billion, reflecting a decline of 3% from the prior-year quarter.

280,a3bbf07b-d70e-35d7-86d5-ea9c24e839ea,AMP,2022-11-26,4 Investment Management Stocks to Watch in a Prospering Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-investment-management-stocks-watch-130401928.html,1669381441,STORY,"['BLK', 'AMP', 'AMG', 'PSEC']","[Higher interest rates will benefit the Zacks Investment Management industry stocks, which bore the brunt of low rates during the pandemic. While elevated technology costs might hurt profitability, investment managers’ margins will no longer be under pressure given the rate hikes. This should aid revenue growth.Moreover, investment managers have benefited from higher volatility and client activity amid the pandemic. Although markets normalized in second-half 2021, client activity has gained momentum once again. Hence, BlackRock, Inc. BLK, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. AMP, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. AMG and Prospect Capital Corporation PSEC should benefit from growth in assets under management (AUM).About the IndustryThe Zacks Investment Management industry consists of companies that manage securities and funds for clients to meet specified investment goals. They earn by charging service fees or commissions. Investment managers are also called asset managers, as they manage hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital and other financial investments for third parties. By appointing an investment manager for one’s assets, investors get more diversification options than they would have if they managed their assets by themselves. Investment managers invest their clients’ assets in different asset classes, depending on their needs and risk-taking abilities. Hence, the diversification, which investors get by appointing asset managers to manage their assets, helps reduce the impact of volatility and ensures steady returns over time.3 Investment Management Industry Trends to ConsiderInterest Rate Hikes to Aid Margin Growth Despite Shift in Preferences: Similar to the past few years, demand for passive investing has been on the rise on the continued need for low-cost investment strategies. Thus, rising demand for passive investments is expected to negatively impact investment managers’ margin growth to some extent. Nevertheless, the interest rate hikes since the beginning of this year to tame the raging inflation will likely result in an improvement in margins in the near term. Also, the rise in industry consolidation witnessed since the beginning of 2020 is likely to support bottom-line growth.Growth in AUM Likely to Continue Despite a Volatile Trend in Asset Flows: In 2020 and the first half of 2021, there was a significant rise in equity market volatility and solid client activity, owing to the coronavirus-induced uncertainty, which aided total AUM growth. In the second half of 2021, markets began to normalize, with client activity remaining decent. Nevertheless, the first nine months of 2022 again witnessed an unexpected rise in volatility and relatively higher client activity, resulting in asset inflows for the majority of the industry players. Thus, despite a volatile trend in flows (seen recently), growth in AUM is expected to continue in the near term. Asset managers’ top lines are, therefore, expected to improve, supported by higher performance fees and investment advisory fees, which constitute the majority of their revenues.Elevated Costs Remain Concerning: The tightening of regulations to increase transparency has led to a rise in compliance costs for investment managers. Also, as wealth managers are constantly trying to upgrade technology to keep up with evolving customer needs, technology costs are expected to keep rising. These will likely lead to an increase in overall expenses, thus, hurting investment managers’ bottom line.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Investment Management industry is a 44-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #89, which places it at the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of bright earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have just started gaining confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. The industry’s current-year earnings estimates have been revised 1.3% higher since the end of October 2022.Thus, we present a few stocks from the prospering industry that you may want to keep an eye on. But before that, let’s check out the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and its sector in the past two years.Stocks in the industry have collectively lost 2.4%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 9.6% and the Zacks Finance Sector has appreciated 12.2%.Two-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TB), which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TB of 3.90X. This compares with the highest level of 5.27X, the lowest level of 2.04X and the median of 3.59X over the past five years. Additionally, the industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 10.30X, which the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)As finance stocks typically have a low P/TB ratio, comparing investment managers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TB ratio with that of its broader sector seems more meaningful. When we compare the group’s P/TB ratio with the broader Finance sector, it seems that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TB of 4.69X for the same period is above the Zacks Investment Management industry’s ratio, which the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)4 Investment Management Stocks to Keep an Eye OnBlackRock: The New York, NY-based Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold) company is the largest asset manager by assets in the United States, with a market capitalization of $110.6 billion.

While its AUM balance declined in the first nine months of 2022 due to the tough operating backdrop amid the macroeconomic concerns, the trend will likely reverse in the future.The company has been continuously strengthening its iShares and exchange-traded funds (ETF) operations. Its efforts to gain market share in the active equity business will likely keep aiding profitability.Supported by a solid balance sheet and liquidity position, BlackRock has expanded via acquisitions, both domestic and overseas. In June 2021, it acquired the Climate Change Scenario Model of Baringa Partners. In February 2021, it completed the acquisition of investment management services provider, Aperio Group. Apart from these, over the years, the company has acquired several firms across the globe, thus, expanding its footprint and market share.Moreover, in August 2022, BlackRock partnered with cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global, to provide its institutional clients with access to digital currencies. Through the partnership, BlackRock’s institutional clients will have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage, and reporting via Coinbase Prime, which is the exchange’s institutional platform, providing a wide range of features and tools.In the past three months, shares of BlackRock have gained 8.8%. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 earnings has been revised marginally upward to $33.88 per share, whereas its 2023 earnings estimates have witnessed a downward revision of 1% to $34.08.Price and Consensus: BLKAmeriprise: Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Ameriprise has a market cap of $35.4 billion. Since 2005-end, the company has been operating independently of American Express Company. As of Sep 30, 2022, it owned, managed and administered assets worth $1.1 trillion.Ameriprise operates a well-diversified portfolio compared with its industry peers. It constantly modifies its product and service-offering capacity to keep pace with dynamic market needs. This strategy, along with asset growth, has helped the company witness a rise in total net revenues.Moreover, AMP has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations. In November 2021, the company acquired BMO Financial Group’s EMEA asset management operations, which will bolster its wealth and asset management businesses and global diversification efforts. In July 2021, it closed a deal for RiverSource Life Insurance Company (its insurance subsidiary) with Global Atlantic’s subsidiary, Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company, to reinsure $7 billion of fixed deferred and immediate annuity policies.In 2019, it divested the Ameriprise Auto &amp; Home business. These initiatives, along with a few others, are expected to continue supporting revenue growth.

The acquisitions of the majority stakes in Parnassus Investments and Abacus Capital Group, along with the buyouts of minority stakes in OCP Asia, Boston Common Asset Management and Systematica, are steps in this direction.While Affiliated Managers’ affiliates have been witnessing overall net outflows over the past few years, the company’s differentiated product categories are likely to support cash flows across channels.AMG has appreciated 20.1% over the past three months.
