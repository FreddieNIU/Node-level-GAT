Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Nucor:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.32 = US$9.1b ÷ (US$32b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Nucor has an ROCE of 32%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Metals and Mining industry average of 12%. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Nucor compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Nucor.What Does the ROCE Trend For Nucor Tell Us?We like the trends that we're seeing from Nucor. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 32%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 114% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Nucor thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.In Conclusion...A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Nucor has. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Nucor and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This takes the dividend yield to 2.8%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for Unum Group Unum Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, Unum Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 15.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 18% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendUnum Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.52 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.32. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.8% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.We Could See Unum Group's Dividend GrowingInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Unum Group has been growing its earnings per share at 9.5% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Unum Group's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.We Really Like Unum Group's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Unum Group that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NASDAQ:MICS) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript July 14, 2023Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Singing Machine Fiscal 2023 Financial Results Earnings Call. My name is Travis and I'll be your operator. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. We will have a brief Safe Harbor and then we will get started. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statement included in our current and periodic filings. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Atkinson, Company CEO. Please go ahead, sir.Gary Atkinson: Thank you, Travis. Hi, good afternoon, everybody. This is Gary Atkinson, Singing Machine's CEO. Joining me on today's call is also Lionel Marquis, the company's CFO and Bernardo Melo, the company Chief Revenue Officer. I'd like to start off today's call by thanking everybody for taking the time to listen in and participate in our fiscal year 2023 earnings call. The 12 months ended March 31, 2023 was a challenging year for Singing Machine, not unlike what many other consumer electronics companies experienced last year. Coming out of the multi-year pandemic and subsequent global supply chain breakdown in calendar 2021, our retail partners, suppliers and logistics partners, all faced uncertainty as to the supply of semiconductors, manufacturing and transportation.As we moved into Calendar 2022, these supply chain issues created a backlog of inventory that finally entered the retail pipeline in the early part of 2022. As the year went on, consumers coped with the negative economic impact of the strong inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and the conflict in Ukraine. Retailers were faced with higher inventory levels and lowering consumer demand, which consequently caused them to cut new orders. All of these factors unfortunately combined together to negatively impact our 2022 holiday retail season, which again unfortunately dominated what was otherwise a very successful and encouraging year for our company and our team. Before our CFO, Lionel Marquis provides a deeper insight into our fiscal year financial performance, I would like to take a few minutes to highlight some of our key milestones that we achieved during the year.Story continuesFirst, we successfully uplisted to the NASDAQ in May of 2022. This was a major accomplishment for our team as this represented many months of hard work, persistence and diligence. As I'm sure all of you listening today are aware this is a very rigorous process. And we view our uplisting as a very positive indication of the level of transparency and accountability our company embraces on a daily basis. As part of the uplisting process, we elected to expand our Board of Directors significantly. We did this in part as a requirement for the uplisting but more importantly to solicit the advice, knowledge and experience of several very successful business leaders with expertise within the consumer electronics, legal, finance and accounting fields.Their ongoing input and counsel will be greatly appreciated as we look to execute on the next phase of our growth plan. To uplist to a national exchange has immediately benefited the company during this fiscal year, as we successfully executed capital raises on better terms than what we have executed in the past. We successfully raised $4 million in a concurrent capital raise during our uplisting back last May. We also announced a $1.7 million at-the-market ATM transaction in October and closed it out in May of this year. Neither transaction involves any warrants or any other long term derivative preferential rights for investors, keeping our capital structure as simple and clean as possible for all shareholders. Moving on, operationally for fiscal '23, we capitalized on the largest opportunity to expand our distribution, which came from Walmart, already our largest single retail partner today.Walmart had done internal research and determined that karaoke belongs in electronics. It was not just a toy item. It was also an entertainment product for adults and families. They revamped their locations to make the consumer electronics department a central feature with a more prominent centralized location within their stores. As part of this development, Walmart asked our team to expand our shelf space commitment, showcasing our higher end karaoke products in the newly expanded electronics department. At the same time, we were able to maintain our shelf space in the toy department, showcasing some of our newer Toyatic [ph] offerings. The net impact for The Singing Machine was that we sold several million in incremental orders to Walmart throughout the fiscal year, offsetting some of what otherwise was a challenging holiday retail environment.For this coming year between toys and electronics departments at Walmart, Walmart stores will carry a total of 14 Singing Machine products on its shelves. While Walmart presented one of our best domestic growth opportunities last year, the Canadian market represents our clearest path to growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond. As a result, we've doubled down our commitment and focus on this market, retaining one of the best-in-class sales reps in Canada. Her team has deep relationships with a number of key Big Box retailers. And we have seen in the period after closing the fiscal year, the steps that we took late in fiscal 2023 are now starting to have a positive impact on our international sales moving forward. Finally, we've examined our global karaoke growth opportunities.We've ultimately concluded that the karaoke market can be divided into four different subsets. Number one is the in-home karaoke consumer product market. Number two is the high end karaoke commercial market. Number three, the emerging automotive market. And finally, number four, the hospitality market. For our company, we've been highly successful within the in-home market, and we enjoy the leading market share in North America for in-home karaoke product sales. However, as this year has proven, this segment presents certain challenges and volatility, namely low single digit industry sales growth, challenging supply chain and a strong reliance on holiday retail consumer demand. As part of our strategic plan, our team is seeking to accelerate our revenue growth, improve overall profitability and diversify our revenue sources.friends singing Pixabay/Public DomainIn order to accomplish this, we have identified the automotive and hospitality space as areas where we intend to devote resources to accomplish these goals. Leading up to our coming annual shareholder meeting in September, our team has been hard at work on new initiatives that we believe will be encouraging relative to the overall outlook for the company. Our growth opportunities are compelling, and we believe we have the brand, the experience and the track record of innovation that should serve us well as we look to execute on these opportunities. With this in mind, I would like to now turn the call over to Lionel Marquis, company CFO, to give greater details on the results of the operations for fiscal 2023. Go ahead Lionel.Lionel Marquis: Thanks, Gary. Good afternoon, everyone. Without any further delay, I'd like to walk through the results of operations of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. To start with revenues. The revenues for the fiscal year 2023 were approximately $39.3 million. This represents a decrease of approximately $8.2 million or 17.3%, as compared to approximately $47.5 million for fiscal year 2022. We experienced a broad based decrease in sales including at four out of our five box retail partners. The decrease in sales was largely due to two main factors. First, customers began the holiday season with excess inventory due to late deliveries in calendar 2021, and due to the lock-jammed supply chains during the latest stages of global pandemic.This generated an overstock situation or position in the first few months of 2023, which made the retail buying representative slightly more conservative during the summer of 2022. Secondly, the news of economic recession. Inflation, interest rate hikes dampened our retail partners' expectations for the holiday season, which all resulted in these customers taking more risk-averse approach to buying leading up to the 2022 holiday season. Several of our major customers required significant co-op promotion incentives on goods sold to assist in holiday inventory sell-through. Co-op promotion incentives for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 increased to $2.3 million or 6% of net sales as compared to approximately $1.7 million or 3.6% of net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.Talk about gross profit, gross profit for the fiscal 2023 was approximately $9.2 million, yielding a 23.4 percentage of total revenues, compared to approximately $10.8 million or 22.8% of sales for fiscal 2022. The net effect resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.6 million as compared to the same period in 2022. If margin had held constant at 2022 levels the decline in gross profits would have been slightly higher at $1.9 million. Gross profit margin for fiscal 2023 was 23.4% compared to 22.8% for fiscal '22, an increase of 0.6 margin points. Contributing to this change was the fact that the company was able to successfully lower its overall logistics expense during the fiscal year saving approximately $1.7 million in cost compared to the prior year.However, higher co-op costs to incentivize retailers to fulfill existing orders increased by approximately $0.6 million. In addition, the company incurred $0.8 million in non-cash expenses relating to inventory, reserves and inventory write-offs. Excluding these non-cash expenses cash gross margins actually improved 280 basis points to 0.60 [ph] basis points growth in fiscal 2023. Operating expenses, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 operating expenses increased to $12.9 million, compared to $10.7 million during the prior year. This represented an increase of $2.2 million or 20.6%. Excluding formulaic selling expenses driven heavily off of direct sales performance, general and operating expenses increased approximately to approximately $9.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, compared to approximately $6.9 million during fiscal year March 31, 2022, an increase of $2.3 million.There was an increase in legal, professional, investor relations and stock transfer costs of approximately $0.9 million, in part related to the public offering, NASDAQ, uplisting, change in control issues, regulatory filings, Delaware franchise fees, preparation costs related to the credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank and arbitration settlement of the alleged employment practice violation lawsuit against a former temporary employee. Excluding the Delaware fees of just over almost $200,000, almost all of the remaining $900,000 increase was largely one-time in nature. There was an increase in compensation expense of $500,000, primarily due to a one-time compensation expense of $400,000 related to a change in control and employment continuation agreement with the Chief Financial Officer.The remaining $100,000 million in increased costs was primarily related to the expansion of the Board of Directors, which also included -- substantial part of it was non-cash equity compensation. Okay, liquidity, as of March 31, 2023, had cash on hand of $2.9 million, as compared to cash on hand of $2.3 million on March 31, 2022. The company reduced its overall working capital investments by approximately $5.2 million during the year as the management team focused heavily on inventory management and building more liquid short term capital position. The company also heavily reduced its short term liabilities. Current liabilities as of March 31, decreased 49% from $12.0 million to $6.1 million during fiscal 2023. As a result, the company had no short term debt, meaning no revolving debt, and 67% less trade payables at fiscal yearend.As a result of all these developments on March 31, 2023, our working capital was approximately $9.1 million. During the next 12 month period, we plan on financing our working capital needs primarily from a combination of vendor financing, revolving line of credit proceeds collected after the fiscal year ended from the completion of our ATM or at-the-market offering. The company believes that its cash on hand and working capital net of cash, cash expected to be generated from its operating forecast, along with availability of cash from its credit facilities will be adequate to meet the company's liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months of the filing -- as of the filing of this report. I would like to now turn the call over to Bernardo Melo, our Chief Revenue Officer who will share some insight into our key accounts and current outlook as we build towards the 2023 holiday retail season.Bernardo.Bernardo Melo: Yeah, thank you, Lionel, and hello, everyone. Thanks for listening to our presentation today. I'm pleased to have the responsibility to provide you some -- everyone with some color on how our key relationships have weathered the recent economic headwinds, as well as our best estimate for how we see coming holiday -- for the coming holiday sales seasons. First, I'd like to provide a brief summary of the overall health and stability of our key account relationships. For year-to-date, our overall commitments from customers are in line with demand from last year. Our last largest accounts are being very precise about ordering, making commitments a little later in the year than normal, but we believe this should benefit out profitability in several ways.First, our manufacturing partners are just really eager to win our businesses here. As obviously, China, things are tough there, they have been making some pricing concessions. For our domestic business, we've seen that the container costs decreased from at peak $18,000 to $20,000 a container, we're seeing containers now ship as low as $2,000 in some cases. We also expect sell-through rates to decline dramatically due to the conservative buying patterns that they're making. Similarly, we have our co-op costs being generally flat, as buyers truly need our inventory just to meet Black Friday sale surge. Lastly, we have seen chargebacks expenses and inventory reserves decreasing for the same reason. While these costs are all expected to decrease, our sales prices to our retail partners remain unchanged.There's virtually no restock remaining from the lingering effects of COVID-19. We successfully worked all of the excess off without inventory write-downs or bad debt from our retail partners. We have been in a very clean net position with our clients. And we expect significant reduction or remain flat in our co-op or other post sales adjustments that normally negatively impact our gross margin. As a result, we anticipate gross margins to greatly improve and helping to impact net earnings even as net sales remain largely unchanged. Looking beyond the holiday season, we're also executing a number of new and exciting fronts to help drive revenues into 2024 and beyond. We're expanding our relationship with Walmart, we see Amazon becoming a strong source of growth in our online sales effort, as we have recently signed a new agency that's top tier in this industry.So we're seeing some new strategies for Amazon and we think we can make a strong push there. We're also very bullish on the prospects of landing one or more pilot accounts in the auto space. And our marketing efforts are expected to ramp up as we build market awareness for our integrated karaoke solutions, and customization capabilities, as we look to become embedded into the outdoor entertainment console. I look forward to provide further updates soon. With that I'll turn the call over back to our CEO, Gary to wrap up our presentation.Gary Atkinson: Perfect, thank you Bernardo. I want to make sure we save some time here for some Q&amp;A. But finally, I just -- I would like to emphasize how proud I am of our team's accomplishments during this past year. Obviously we're, as a management team, we're disappointed in the overall results from a financial perspective. But given how fiscal 2023 began, with a great deal of uncertainty, and retailers adjusting to the lingering effects of COVID and its impacts on logistics, inventory, and obviously retail consumers, I felt like we adapted rapidly. We positioned our brand and products in a way to capture as much market share as possible, especially with the overall challenges that we've all been seeing in the market. And finally, it's equally important to say that we've made a lot of great progress on a lot of exciting new fronts.So transitioning to NASDAQ, taking key steps to enter the automotive and soon to be hospitality spaces within karaoke, are all part of our long term focus on sustained profitable growth, maintaining our best-in-class brand, and world class partnerships in all we do. So that being said, I believe 2023 reflected our vision well, and the milestones that we accomplished are just only the beginning of where we intend to go. So with that being said, I'd like to turn the call back over to our moderator and open it up now for any Q&amp;A.See also 15 Merger Arbitrage Opportunities in 2023 and 10 Best Innovative Stocks that Pay Dividends.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:RJF) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 76% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Raymond James Financial. Check out our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Raymond James Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Raymond James Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Raymond James Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Raymond James Financial is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.8% by the third-largest shareholder.We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Raymond James FinancialThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Raymond James Financial, Inc.. Insiders own US$2.2b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Raymond James Financial. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Raymond James Financial that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up?New York’s air quality was briefly the worst in the world in early June, as smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted over the city. Meanwhile, the office vacancy rate hit a record high of 22.7% earlier this year, raising alarm bells for commercial real estate investors and Wall Street.Despite these overlapping crises, Paterson remained hopeful about the city’s long-term future. He compared the current situation to the city’s fiscal crisis in the 1970s and the aftermath of the Sept. 11th attacks: “New York has always been a resilient city that’s always kind of bounced back,” he said. “We still have that resilience, that desire and that drive to bring the city back as one of the great cities, if not the greatest city, in this country,”Investors who share this optimism could see the ongoing dip in sentiment as an opportunity to invest in New York’s most attractive assets.Iconic propertiesThe best way to make a contrarian bet on New York’s rebound is to own a piece of its iconic skyline. Empire State Realty Trust ([NYSE:ESRT), as the name suggests, owns the Empire State building along with other commercial and residential properties spread across the city.Altogether, the portfolio includes 8.9 million square feet of office space, 718,000 square feet of retail space and 721 residential units across three multifamily properties.Story continuesThe stock is flat over the past year, but is down 58.4% over the past five years. However, it’s looking relatively cheap right now. The stock trades at a price-to-book ratio of 1.18, which means each unit of stock is worth 118% of the value of the underlying property.The stock also offers a 2% dividend yield with a 42.4% dividend payout. That means there’s room for the dividend to expand if revenue or occupancy rebounds in the years ahead.Read more: 3 big mistakes people make with cash back credit cards that cost them every time they swipeCommercial propertiesAmerican Strategic Investment Co.’s ticker symbol (NYSE:NYC) makes it clear that the stock is a proxy for the city’s economy. The company was formerly known as New York City REIT. The portfolio includes eight commercial properties with a total of 1.2 million square feet spread throughout Manhattan. As of the first quarter of 2023, the total occupancy rate of these properties was 84%, higher than the city’s average.Also, the average lease term had seven years remaining — many of the company’s tenants won’t be leaving for a while. The tenant mix is also comforting, with 26% in the financial services sector and 13% in government agencies and services. Government tenants are somewhat immune to the business cycle while financial services are more tethered to the global economy than New York alone.The stock trades at just 6% of book value per share, which makes it severely undervalued.Apartment propertiesLegendary investor Sam Zell, who passed away earlier this year, was famous for his contrarian bets. In one of his last public appearances, Zell called remote work “bulls—” and was convinced employees would head back to the office. His company EquityResidential (NYSE:EQR) is certainly positioned for it with extensive exposure to America’s largest cities and over 36 properties in New York City.The company’s portfolio consists of 301 properties with 79,351 apartment units across major cities like Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California, Denver, Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin. The stock offers a 3.9% dividend yield and trades at a price-to-book ratio of 2.23 — which makes it the most expensive REIT on this list.What to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)This janitor in Vermont built an $8M fortune without anyone around him knowing.

(NYSE:XYL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 73% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Xylem. View our latest analysis for Xylem ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Xylem?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Xylem.

Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of XylemWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.

However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Xylem Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$75m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Hong Kong’s benchmark lost 2% as it reopened after a weather related closure on Monday.On Monday, China reported weaker economic growth for the spring than most economists had expected. Its recovery following the removal of anti-COVID restrictions has fallen short of forecasts. That has helped to limit inflation globally but it also is hindering a main engine of growth for the world economy.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.2% to 32,438.27. Markets in Tokyo also were closed Monday, for a holiday. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 0.5% to 7,264.90. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3% to 2,611.96. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gave up more than 400 points, falling to 19,008.06, while the Shanghai Composite dropped 0.4% to 3,196.86.On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 4,522.79, its highest closing level in 15 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2% to 34,585.35, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9%, to 14,244.95.In the United States, the economy has remained resilient, avoiding recession so far despite much higher interest rates meant to push down high inflation.This upcoming week will offer more details on how the economy has affected companies as corporate earnings season ramps up. This week, nearly 60 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are scheduled to report how much profit they made in April-June.Expectations are modest. Analysts are forecasting the worst drop for earnings per share among S&amp;P 500 companies since the pandemic was pummeling the economy in the spring of 2020, according to FactSet. They’re also forecasting a third straight quarter of declines in profits.Several banks and Delta Air Lines helped kick off the reporting season last week with reports that were better than feared. This upcoming week will feature reports from Bank of America, Netflix and Tesla, among others.Story continuesWhile last week's earnings reports offer just a small sample size, the season's start is encouraging because of how strong corporate forecasts have generally been for future results, according to strategists at Bank of America.“We expect the momentum to continue,” the strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a BofA Global Research report. They expect earnings declines for S&amp;P 500 companies to bottom out this reporting season.Also coming up this week will be the latest monthly update on sales at U.S. retailers. Strong spending by U.S. consumers has been one of the main reasons for the economy’s resilience, driven by a remarkably sturdy job market.The stock market's big run has critics warning that it is not a certainty the economy will avoid a recession, that inflation will continue to coast lower and that corporate profits will recover.The wide expectation is for the Fed to raise rates at its meeting next week, which would take the federal funds rate to its highest level since 2001. But the hope among traders nevertheless is that will be the final hike of this cycle.Easier interest rates help all kinds of stocks, but investors see big technology and other high-growth stocks as some of the biggest beneficiaries.Several helped the market to rise Monday, including Tesla, which climbed 3.2%. Tesla also said over the weekend that its first production Cybertruck electric pickup has rolled off the assembly line, though that was nearly two years behind the original schedule.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. oil added 31 cents to $74.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The alert was subsequently withdrawn because it repeated news published on June 4.Oil also came under pressure on Monday from the resumption of output at two of three Libyan fields shut last week. Output had been halted by a protest against the abduction of a former finance minister.Meanwhile, Russian oil exports from western ports are set to fall by 100,000-200,000 barrels per day (bpd) next month, a sign that Moscow is making good on a pledge for supply cuts in tandem with Saudi Arabia, two sources said on Friday.U.S. shale oil production is also set to fall to nearly 9.40 million bpd in August, which would be the first monthly decline since December 2022, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Monday.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Additional reporting by Alex Lawler, Florence Tan and Mohi Narayan; Editing by Mike Harrison, Barbara Lewis and David Evans)]"

Weakness in the dollar and optimism over slowing U.S. inflation were the biggest drivers of the rally.But this rally somewhat stalled on Friday after data indicated that U.S. consumer sentiment and spending remained robust - a trend that could herald sticky inflation in the country and keep the Federal Reserve hawkish.Losses spilled over into Monday, as traders locked in additional profits following weak data from China.Brent oil futures fell 0.9% to $79.13 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.9% to $74.62 a barrel by 22:21 ET (02:21 GMT). Both contracts rose sharply over the past three weeks, also benefiting from signs of tighter supply following oilfield and loading shutdowns in Nigeria and Libya.But production from most of Libya’s major oil fields resumed over the weekend, offsetting this trend.China Q2 GDP underwhelmsSecond-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data from China showed that economic growth in the world’s largest oil importer slowed substantially from the first quarter.The economy also grew at a slower-than-expected pace from the prior year, as its biggest drivers - manufacturing and real estate activity - remained under pressure.Weak economic readings from China have largely undermined forecasts that a recovery in the country will drive global crude demand to record highs this year. A recovery in the country now appears to be running out of steam, despite the lifting of anti-COVID measures earlier in the year.Still, recent trade data showed that China’s oil imports remained largely robust, aided in part by refineries building inventory amid relatively low crude prices. But Chinese fuel demand remained under pressure, amid slowing business activity.Story continuesCrude markets remain focused on tighter supply, rate hikesBeyond China, oil markets remained squarely focused on tightening global supplies and rising interest rates. Crude supply is expected to reduce substantially in the second half of 2023 as the impact of Saudi Arabian and Russian production cuts begins to be felt.But this is expected to be somewhat offset by slowing global economic activity, especially as U.S. interest rates remain higher for longer. The full impact of the Fed's recent rate hike cycle is also yet to be felt by the economy.Still, expectations of an imminent pause in the Fed's rate hike cycle drove stellar gains in oil over the past two weeks, although markets now appear to have run out of steam.Related ArticlesOil slides from recent highs as China GDP underwhelmsOil slips on weak China GDP data, resumption of Libya outputChina-US climate progress could hinge on new methane deal]"

Never miss another market-moving alert.Alphabet riding high on AI rolloutAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock bumped higher Thursday after it said it was rolling out its artificial-intelligence chatbot, Bard, in Europe and Brazil, as the tech giant looks to take the AI fight to rival ChatGPT.Morgan Stanley said in a note that Google Search, which still makes up the bulk of Alphabet’s revenue, will likely become ""more personalized” and develop “critical competitive moats” as the tech giant invests further in AI.The analyst also said Alphabet remains ""in the best position to disrupt/improve its own business"" via AI, noting:It is still early in AI adoption, and it will likely require new innovation and tools to further accelerate adoption. This, in our view, should help GOOGL manage the user and behavior transition and minimize near-term impacts on revenue and monetization.GOOGL shares climbed more than 6% for the week to $125.42.Elon Musk launches xAIElon Musk got in the AI battle as well with the launch of his xAI artificial intelligence outfit Wednesday.Musk has repeatedly issued warnings regarding AI in the past, and signed a letter in March that called the scramble for AI dominance ""an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one - not even their creators - can understand, predict, or reliably control.""Musk said his plan for building safer AI includes rendering it ""maximally curious"" instead of attempting to program in morality, noting, ""I think it is going to be pro-humanity from the standpoint that humanity is just much more interesting than not-humanity.""Story continuesIn addition to this new role, Musk also famously leads Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), SpaceX, and Twitter.Coinbase propels higher on court victory for Ripple LabsCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) shares soared Thursday after a federal court ruled that blockchain firm Ripple Labs did not violate federal securities law in selling its blockchain currency, XRP, on public exchanges.After the news, Needham &amp; Company kept Coinbase's Buy rating and raised its price target to $120 from the prior $70.Needham said the summary judgment constituted ""a positive read-through to COIN as it sets precedent that crypto token sales through exchanges, at least in the XRP case, did not violate securities laws. We believe this outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock.""The analyst also provided a recap of the summary judgment:1. Inst. sales (i.e. initial XRP token sales): granted the SEC's motion that these sales violated securities laws.2. Programmatic sales (secondary XRP sales on crypto exchanges): denied the SEC's motion; these sales did not constitute an investment contract.3. Other non-cash distributions: denied the SEC's motion, these distributions did not have an exchange of money, thus did not qualify as an investment contract.Research firm Berenberg, for its part, does not believe the rally is justified and argues that the ruling does not necessarily constitute a definitive victory for Coinbase. The firm maintained its Hold rating on the stock, as well as its $39 price target.Coinbase shares finished the week up 33% to $105.31.Analysts applaud Salesforce plan to raise pricesSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) shares advanced Tuesday after the company said it would hike list prices on its products starting next month, noting that this was the first increase in seven years.Specifically, the company will charge an average of 9% more for Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Industries and Tableau.Evercore ISI believes the move is reasonable and could provide a potential tailwind for earnings:While there will clearly be some complaints from customers about the price increase, after a 7 year hiatus, we believe that a 9% increase is pretty reasonable given that other SaaS companies have passed through annual increases in the 4-5% range.Needham &amp; Company meanwhile hiked the stock's price target to $250 from the prior $230, arguing that the higher prices offer an ""opportunity for top and bottom line benefit.""After Salesforce's roughly 4% climb on Tuesday, shares continued drifting higher and ultimately finished the week up 9.5% to $229.33.Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Ralph Lauren’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren Is Ralph Lauren Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Ralph Lauren seems to be fairly priced at around 20% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ralph Lauren today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $156.45, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Ralph Lauren’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Ralph Lauren look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ralph Lauren's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 45%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in RL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on RL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Ralph Lauren at this point in time.

It is developing a personal assistant it says could act as a mentor or handle tasks such as securing flight credit and a hotel after a travel delay, according to a podcast by co-founders Reid Hoffman and Mustafa Suleyman.Adept, an AI startup that's raised $415 million, touts its business benefits; in a demo posted online, it shows how you can prompt its technology with a sentence, and then watch it navigate a company's Salesforce customer-relationship database on its own, completing a task it says would take a human 10 or more clicks.Alphabet declined to comment on agent-related work, while Microsoft said its vision is to keep humans in control of AI copilots, rather than autopilots.STEP 1: DESTROY HUMANITYQiu and four other agent developers said they expected the first systems that can reliably perform multi-step tasks with some autonomy to come to market within a year, focused on narrow areas such coding and marketing tasks.""The real challenge is building systems with robust reasoning,"" said Qiu.The race towards increasingly autonomous AI agents has been supercharged by the March release of GPT-4 by developer OpenAI, a powerful upgrade of the model behind ChatGPT - the chatbot that became a sensation when released last November.GPT-4 facilitates the type of strategic and adaptable thinking required to navigate the unpredictable real world, said Vivian Cheng, an investor at venture capital firm CRV who has a focus on AI agents.Early demonstrations of agents capable of comparatively complex reasoning came from individual developers who created the BabyAGI and AutoGPT open-source projects in March, which can prioritize and execute tasks such as sales prospecting and ordering pizza based on a pre-defined objective and the results of previous actions.Today's early crop of agents are merely proof-of-concepts, according to eight developers interviewed, and often freeze or suggest something that makes no sense. If given full access to a computer or payment information, an agent could accidentally wipe a computer's drive or buy the wrong thing, they say.""There's so many ways it can go wrong,"" said Aravind Srinivas, CEO of ChatGPT competitor Perplexity AI, who has opted instead to offer a human-supervised copilot product. ""You have to treat AI like a baby and constantly supervise it like a mom.""Many computer scientists focused on AI ethics have pointed out near-term harm that could come from the perpetuation of human biases and the potential for misinformation. And while some see a future Jarvis, others fear the murderous HAL 9000 from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".Computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, known as a ""godfather of AI"" for his work on neural networks and deep learning, urges caution. He fears future advanced iterations of the technology could create and act on their own, unexpected, goals.""Without a human in the loop that checks every action to see if it's not dangerous, we might end up with actions that are criminal or could harm people,"" said Bengio, calling for more regulation. ""In years from now these systems could be smarter than us, but it doesn't mean they have the same moral compass.""In one experiment posted online, an anonymous creator instructed an agent called ChaosGPT to be a ""destructive, power-hungry, manipulative AI."" The agent developed a 5-step plan, with Step 1: ""Destroy humanity"" and Step 5: ""Attain immortality"".It didn't get too far, though, seeming to disappear down a rabbit hole of researching and storing information about history's deadliest weapons and planning Twitter posts.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is currently investigating OpenAI over concerns of consumer harm, did not address autonomous agents directly, but referred Reuters to previously published blogs on deepfakes and marketing claims about AI. OpenAI's CEO has said the startup follows the law and will work with the FTC.'DUMB AS A ROCK'Existential fears aside, the commercial potential could be large. Foundation models are trained on vast amounts of data such as text from the internet using artificial neural networks that are inspired by the architecture of biological brains.OpenAI itself is very interested in AI agent technology, according to four people briefed on its plans. Garg, one of the people it briefed, said OpenAI is wary of releasing its own open-ended agent into the market before fully understanding the issues. The company told Reuters it conducts rigorous testing and builds broad safety protocols before releasing new systems.Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest backer, is among the big guns taking aim at the AI agent field with its ""copilot for work"" that can draft solid emails, reports and presentations.CEO Satya Nadella sees foundation-model technology as a leap from digital assistants such as Microsoft's own Cortana, Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and the Google Assistant - which, in his view, have all fallen short of initial expectations.""They were all dumb as a rock. Whether it's Cortana or Alexa or Google Assistant or Siri, all these just don't work,"" he told the Financial Times in February.An Amazon spokesperson said that Alexa already uses advanced AI technology, adding that its team is working on new models that will make the assistant more capable and useful. Apple declined to comment.Google said it's constantly improving its assistant as well and that its Duplex technology can phone restaurants to book tables and verify hours.AI expert Edward Grefenstette also joined the company's research group Google DeepMind last month to ""develop general agents that can adapt to open-ended environments"".Still, the first consumer iterations of quasi-autonomous agents may come from more nimble startups, according to some of the people interviewed.Investors are pouncing.Jason Franklin of WVV Capital said he had to fight to invest in an AI-agents company from two former Google Brain engineers. In May, Google Ventures led a $2 million seed round in Cognosys, developing AI agents for work productivity, while Hesam Motlagh, who founded the agent startup Arkifi in January, said he closed a ""sizeable"" first financing round in June.There are at least 100 serious projects working to commercialize agents, said Matt Schlicht, who writes a newsletter on AI.""Entrepreneurs and investors are extremely excited about autonomous agents,"" he said. ""They're way more excited about that than they are simply about a chatbot.""(Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco and Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto; Editing by Kenneth Li and Pravin Char)]"

(NASDAQ:WBA) will pay a dividend of $0.48 on the 12th of September. This makes the dividend yield 6.6%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance Walgreens Boots Alliance's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Despite not generating a profit, Walgreens Boots Alliance is still paying a dividend. The company is also yet to generate cash flow, so the dividend sustainability is definitely questionable.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 21%, so there isn't too much pressure on the dividend.historic-dividendWalgreens Boots Alliance Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.10 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.7% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though Walgreens Boots Alliance's EPS has declined at around 28% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM).

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on PPG Industries is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$1.9b ÷ (US$22b - US$4.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, PPG Industries has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries roceIn the above chart we have measured PPG Industries' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PPG Industries here  for free.So How Is PPG Industries' ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at PPG Industries, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 14%, but since then they've fallen to 11%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From PPG Industries' ROCETo conclude, we've found that PPG Industries is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 55% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.If you'd like to know about the risks facing PPG Industries, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Meanwhile the benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rose about 2.3%.Financials kicked off earnings season on Friday telling two different stories about the banking system. Large institutions like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) topped analyst expectations as JPMorgan reported a 67% increase in profits in the second quarter.But as Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith points out, both of those institutions have large consumer franchises and benefit from things like increased credit card borrowing. Meanwhile Citigroup (C), which relies more heavily on investment banking, saw revenues decline 1% from last year. Citi's stock fell more than 4% on the news.""The long-awaited rebound in investment banking has yet to materialize,"" Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said in a release, ""making for a disappointing quarter.""Wall Street dealmaking will be in focus this week as Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) will each report results. All are expected to show drops in investment banking and trading from the first quarter.Story continuesInvestors will be particularly keen to hear from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon amid concerns about the health of the Wall Street institution after job cuts and reports of internal pushback about the bank's strategy.""It's body language from David Solomon, whether he can show that the strategy they have is going to work,"" CFRA Research research director Ken Leon told Yahoo Finance Live. ""They will gain wallet share in the core business. There's no question about that.""CEO of Goldman Sachs David Solomon participates in a panel titled ""Empowering Women as Entrepreneurs and Leaders"" at the 2023 Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, U.S., April 13, 2023. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)On the tech front, Tesla and Netflix will kick off a busy few weeks for the sector at the center of this year's market rally.With its stock up nearly 130% this year Tesla has seen investors react both to AI-related hype around its self-driving capabilities as well as strong vehicle delivery figures and the rapid expansion of its Supercharger network with industry competitors.Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney noted in a note on Thursday that the ""primary focus will be on its non-GAAP auto gross margin"" as investors weigh how recent price cuts are impacting Tesla's profits.With inflation moderating margins will likely be a focus across sectors as companies grapple with inflation no longer buoying top line growth.""Margins [are] something that we want to really pay attention to in regards to the pricing power of companies,"" Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez told Yahoo Finance Live.Netflix stock is up a relatively more measured 50% this year, but investors will be keen for commentary from company executives on how any fallout from work stoppages in Hollywood are weighing on the company's plans with the streaming business appearing to be at an inflection point.Broadly, earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline 7% this quarter, which some analysts believe will mark the bottom of the current earnings recession.And though a small sample size, companies last week seemed to pass the initial test.Delta, PepsiCo (PEP), JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo all topped analyst expectations but none saw outsized stock moves following their results.Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird, told Yahoo Finance Live this could be the trend for the quarter. Beating Street estimates could be good enough to help stocks maintain gains but not necessarily send stocks higher, he said.""Unless you're seeing big beats, double line beats, maybe it's not enough to spark the next leg higher for a market that's sitting at bull market highs or the highs for this cycle,"" Mayfield said. ""So I think it'll take a little bit more than just beating these de-risked estimates to spark a new leg higher.""Weekly Calendar MondayEconomic data: Empire Fed manufacturing, July (-3.4 expected, +6.6 previously)Earnings: No notable earnings.Tuesday Economic data: National Association of Home Builders sentiment index, July (56 expected, 55 previously); Industrial production, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, -0.2% prior) Retail sales month-over-month, June (+0.5% expected, 0.3% previously); Retail sales month-over- month, excluding auto and gas, June (+0.4%, 0.4% previously)Earnings: Bank of America (BAC), BNY Mellon (BK), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR, J.B.

These numbers indicate that EV company growth is far from over for. Further expansion is only natural since EVs only make up some 1% of the 250 million vehicles on the road in the U.S. This means that the growth story is still in its early stages.But Tesla is no longer the only EV company in the world. This sector now has many competitors. Most of these incoming competitors are risky due to high cash burn and negligible sales, but the high upside potential is compelling. In contrast, you can also buy EV stocks that are focused on the charging market. The competition here is somewhat milder, with a better risk-to-reward ratio. Picking the right stocks in all these sectors can lead to tremendous gains as EV sales accelerate.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd so, let’s look at three promising EV stocks that offer compelling entry points for the long term.ChargePoint (CHPT)A close-up of an orange ChargePoint (CHPT) station.Source: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.comChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the leading providers of EV charging solutions, with over 200,000 charging ports worldwide. Even though it’s not directly an EV stock, it will benefit substantially from the increased amount of EVs on the road. This gives the company a 65%-plus market share with a strong network effect. Among the most solid EV-related stocks to buy, it continues trading at a depressed level despite the upside potential.EV charging demand is expected to grow exponentially as more countries adopt policies to phase out fossil-fuel vehicles and incentivize EV adoption. According to a report by McKinsey, the U.S. goal of 48 million EVs on the road by 2030 would require the charging infrastructure to be 20 times larger than the current size. ChargePoint is well-positioned to capture a large share of this market if it retains the market share it already has. Even if it retains a 30% market share, it is still positioned to generate substantial returns.Story continuesAs investors rotated out of high-growth names amid rising inflation and interest rates last year, CHPT remains a compelling buy as it lingers sideways. The consensus price target implies a 77.6% upside, thus making ChargePoint a long-term winner in the EV charging space.Polestar (PSNY)Close up Polestar logo with electric car in store. Polestar (PSNY) is a Swedish automotive brand owned by Volvo Cars and GeelySource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.comPolestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) is the second EV stock that has caught my attention recently. Polestar has two models in production: the Polestar 1, a plug-in hybrid sports car with a limited run of 1,500 units, and the Polestar 2, a battery-electric sedan that competes with Tesla’s Model 3. The company also plans to launch three more models by 2024. Those will be the Polestar 3, an electric SUV; the Polestar Precept, a luxury electric sedan; and the Polestar 4, a convertible electric coupe.Truly, the delivery numbers set Polestar apart from other startup EV companies. It recently reported that after “strong deliveries in the month of June, up 73% year-on-year, Polestar achieved its best ever second quarter, delivering approximately 15,800 vehicles, a growth of 36% compared to last year. With record global deliveries of around 27,900 for the first six months…”The future projections don’t look too shabby either, as it targets up to 70,000 deliveries in 2023. Despite this performance, Polestar’s stock has been trading below its SPAC merger price of $10 since its debut. So, investors remain skeptical about its growth prospects and valuation. However, I think Polestar has the potential to become a leading EV brand in the premium segment. Its stock could reward patient investors in the long run. The consensus analyst price target implies a 22.5% upside; not bad at all.Aptiv (APTV)An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.Source: shutterstock.comAptiv (NYSE:APTV) is also an indirect EV stock, but it’s a safer deal than many other EV businesses due to the combination of value, growth, and a lack of risk. Aptiv is a high-quality EV stock that offers exposure to multiple growth drivers in the automotive industry. I would recommend buying it on any dips.The company is a global leader in automotive technology, providing solutions for electrical, electronic, and safety systems. In addition, it’s a trend-setter in the fast-growing segments of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), active safety, connectivity, and electrification.Accordingly, the company reported revenue of $4.8 billion in Q1 2023, up 15% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, up ~100% YOY. The company also updated its full-year guidance. Yet, Aptiv is trading at an inexpensive valuation of 25 times forward earnings, lower than many of its peers in the EV space.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), which is up 79%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 33% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 18% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for American International Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.American International Group was able to grow its EPS at 19% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 22% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on American International Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, American International Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 94%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican International Group provided a TSR of 18% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 5% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand American International Group better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with American International Group (including 1 which is potentially serious) .But note: American International Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The company lost nearly 1 million subscribers in the year-ago period.It has also been two full quarters since Netflix launched its ad-supported tier, which likely pulled in 2.7 million subscribers in the April-June period, according to research firm Visible Alpha.""We expect the most important aspect of Netflix's crackdown on password sharing will be the catalyst it creates to attract more users to its $6.99 ad tier base, in turn generating higher revenue from advertising,"" Macquarie analysts said.Ad-supported revenue likely came in at $169.3 million in the second quarter. Insider Intelligence predicts Netflix could generate $770 million in ad revenue by the end of 2023.The second quarter also featured some strong programming from Netflix, including hits like ""Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story"" and ""Never Have I Ever Season 4"".WALL STREET SENTIMENT* 21 of 43 analysts covering the stock rate it ""buy"" or higher, while 20 have a ""hold"" rating and two ""sell""* Analysts' median price target on the stock is $400* Netflix is currently trading at $446(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Shounak Dasgupta)]"

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Zoetis How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:46% = US$2.1b ÷ US$4.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.46.Does Zoetis Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Zoetis has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Zoetis' Debt And Its 46% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Zoetis, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.47. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy.

The Singapore banking giant’s 5-star analyst, Pei Hwa Ho, lays out 3 reasons to back the U.S.’s largest utility and renewable energy company.First off, there’s the combination of a “steady” utility business plus exciting renewable growth, with the company boasting a “unique proposition and wide economic moat.” The regulated utility business is experiencing gradual yet consistent expansion due to the ongoing influx of people moving to Florida, leading to an increased demand for utilities. At the same time, the company’s renewable energy segment has significant potential for growth. It plays a crucial part in achieving the company’s ambitious Real Zero objective, announced in June 2022, which aims to completely eliminate carbon emissions from its operations by 2045 at the latest. Furthermore, there are plans to convert 16GW of current natural gas units to operate on green hydrogen.Secondly, with the energy transition underway in the U.S., the company is “strongly positioned” to take advantage. NextEra intends to double its solar and wind business from 24 gigawatts (GW) capacity in 2021 to 46-53GW capacity in 2025. At the same time, during the same period, it is eyeing expansion of its battery storage capacity to 6-8GW, a 6-8 folds increase.Lastly, Ho points to the company’s “strong execution” as a reason to believe its ambitious growth targets amidst “slowing economic activity” are achievable. Over the past 10 years, the company has demonstrated an “excellent track record to weather through cycles,” generating a 10% adjusted EPS CAGR (compound annual growth rate), some distance above top 10 US power firms’ 3% CAGR. “Besides accelerated growth from renewables,” Ho adds, “it also has best-in-class operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), achieving continuous cost savings through technology innovation and digitalisation that allows NEE to offer low-cost clean energy.”Story continuesBased on the reasons above, the DBS analyst rates NEE shares as a Buy, backed by a $93 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 27% from current levels.Looking at the ratings breakdown, with a total of 7 Buys and 3 Holds, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Moderate Buy. Over the next year, shares are expected to appreciate by 20%, considering the average target clocks in at $87.89.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Patterson Companies'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Patterson Companies is:18% = US$207m ÷ US$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Patterson Companies' Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo begin with, Patterson Companies seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Patterson Companies' decent 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then performed a comparison between Patterson Companies' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 12% in the same 5-year period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Patterson Companies is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Patterson Companies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 51% (or a retention ratio of 49%) for Patterson Companies suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Besides, Patterson Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 38% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Patterson Companies' performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Qualcomm Stock Could Be a Value Trap.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caution-qualcomm-stock-could-value-101529262.html,1689070529,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Just because a stock isn’t near its all-time high, doesn’t mean there’s a good buying opportunity. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is a textbook example of this.Before you think about taking a share position in Qualcomm, make a thorough analysis of the relevant facts and metrics. Ultimately, you’ll probably decide to stay on the sidelines.Qualcomm has a global scope as it distributes wireless products, including artificial intelligence (AI) enabled device components, to multiple regions. That’s all fine and well, until international conflict flares up.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNow, as 2023 enters its second half, Qualcomm and its shareholders could be in for a bumpy ride.Is QCOM Stock Irresistible, or Just a Non-Starter?Before we get into the international issues, let’s clear up an important issue. As the old saying goes, price is what you pay, but value is what you actually get. So, is QCOM stock a good value now?Not really. It’s not a good sign that the Qualcomm share price increased little in this year’s first half. This occurred despite the rally in the Nasdaq, and despite Qualcomm jumping on the AI bandwagon.In other words, QCOM looks more like a non-starter than a real value. Besides, while Qualcomm’s GAAP trailing 12-month (TTM) price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.27x might look enticing, there are other metrics to consider.For instance, Qualcomm’s TTM price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.14x is higher than the sector median P/S ratio of 2.83x. Qualcomm’s TTM price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 6.52x is more than double the sector median P/B ratio of 3.08x.China-U.S. Tensions Could Cause ProblemsDue to general softness in smartphone sales, Qualcomm reportedly implemented job cuts at the company’s San Diego headquarters. Clearly, Qualcomm isn’t in perfect condition financially and operationally.Now, there’s an extrinsic issue that could pose a major problem for Qualcomm. According to Reuters and The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. government is considering enacting new restrictions of AI chip exports to China. Apparently, U.S. officials are concerned about potential security breaches stemming from China using American-made AI chips.Story continuesQualcomm and other tech-component manufacturers might need a special export license to ship certain products to China. You’ll definitely want to stay tuned for updates on this ongoing story.Play It Safe, and Just Watch QCOM StockAre shares of Qualcomm trading at an attractive value? It depends which metric you’re using. Some valuation gauges seem to indicate that it’s not the right time to start an investment in Qualcomm.Then, we need to look at extrinsic problems. Even if there are no immediate export restrictions, simmering Sino-U.S. tensions could affect Qualcomm’s top and bottom lines in the future. Therefore, it’s probably better to be safe than sorry, and to stay on the sidelines with QCOM stock.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveDid Elon Musk Just Trigger a New Netscape Moment?The $1 Investment You MUST Take Advantage of Right NowThe Rich Use This Income Secret (NOT Dividends) Far More Than Regular InvestorsThe post Caution!

Trip elements must be worth $25 or more in USD, excluding taxes and fees, to qualify.It's fast and easy to move up One Key tiers. The criteria to qualify for each tier:Blue – Sign up for freeSilver – 5 trip elements within a yearGold – 15 trip elements within a yearPlatinum – 30 trip elements within a yearSo, for example, if a member books two nights in a hotel and a three-day car rental, they would earn 5 trip elements, enough to reach Silver in one trip.**VIP Access properties: VIP Access is a collection of properties offering stays that consistently receive the highest guest reviews on Expedia Group and meet stringent standards of quality.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, Nvidia NVDA, Carnival Corp. CCL, PulteGroup Inc. PHM and Copart, Inc. CPRT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:The S&amp;P 500 Index reached 4,500 for the first time in more than 15 months as bulls continued to roar. A cooler-than-expected inflation report revived hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its interest rate increases. Additionally, favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) are driving market optimism.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, has risen 17.5% so far this year. We have highlighted four stocks from different sectors that have gained more than 50% this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These companies have also witnessed positive estimate revisions for the current fiscal year. These are Nvidia, Carnival Corp., PulteGroup Inc. and Copart, Inc.Technology remained the major outperformer, followed by the cyclical sectors. Inflation in the United States cooled down for the 12th consecutive month in June. The Consumer Price Index rose 3% year over year, marking the lowest rate since early 2021, and 0.2% over the last month. Although inflation has dropped from a peak of 9.1%, it is still significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target (read: 5 ETFs to Gain as Inflation Drops to a 2-Year Low).Easing inflation indicates that the economy is stabilizing and interest rates may be declining. This could boost investor confidence and encourage more investments in the stock market. Lower inflation often leads to lower interest rates, which can reduce borrowing costs for companies, potentially leading to higher profits and, in turn, higher stock prices. Economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace, with robust job gains and a low unemployment rate and moderated inflation.Story continuesConsumer confidence unexpectedly jumped to an 18-month high in June amid lingering fears of a recession. The U.S. housing sector has also shown immense improvement, with homebuilder confidence reaching its highest level in almost a year.Despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has raised rates this year, interest rates have largely remained low.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.SPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.5% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $421 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 79 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors. SPY has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).Below we have highlighted the above-mentioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.Best-Performing Stocks of SPYNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 214.6% so far this year. It saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 90 days for the fiscal year ending January 2024, with an estimated growth of 129.9%.Nvidia makes up for 3.02% of the assets in SPY and has a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Carnival operates as a cruise and vacation company. As a single economic entity, Carnival Corporation &amp; Carnival plc forms the largest cruise operator in the world. Carnival is the world’s leading leisure travel firm and carries nearly half of the global cruise guests. The stock has surged 120% so far this year and accounts for 0.05% of the total assets.Carnival saw its earnings estimate being revised upward from a loss of 31 cents to a loss of 16 cents for the fiscal year ending November 2023.

However, bank stocks have missed out on the party.The broader Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) is down 1.5% on the year. Smaller banks have fared worse, with the S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (NYSEARCA:KRE) falling nearly 30% year to date.Of course, the reason for this is the collapse of three regional banks earlier this year, which spooked depositors and investors alike, causing them to flee. But the U.S. government and larger banks quickly stepped in to avoid a collapse.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile bank stocks have recovered off their 2023 lows, there are still opportunities to find undervalued names by focusing on banks that have consistent and sustainable advantages. In particular, the undervalued bank stocks below should deliver big gains once investor sentiment improves due to their geographic and business model advantages.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is one of the most dominant and respected investment banks in America. However, the stock has struggled over the past two years as the bank sought to get its retail banking unit off the ground and as broader market conditions hurt investment banking operations.In late 2022, Goldman admitted to its missteps in its consumer banking launch and announced it would pivot its focus away from retail banking and back to its bread-and-butter business of investment banking. Of course, these operations, which include advising firms on mergers and acquisitions and underwriting initial public offerings (IPOs) are highly tied to financial market conditions.Demand for these services dropped markedly in 2022 as companies attempted to navigate economic uncertainty and a potential recession. For instance, the IPO market froze up last year. But there are signs of life with a number of high-profile stock debuts in recent weeks, including Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA), which went public in mid-June.Story continuesWhile GS stock is up 5% from its March low, it is still down 6.5% year to date. That makes for a solid entry point in this cheap bank stock to buy.Bank of Hawaii (BOH)A photograph of the ocean.Source: Manu Galdamez/ShutterStock.comInterestingly, none of the too-big-to-fail American banks are very active in Hawaii’s retail banking market given the state’s smaller size and geographic isolation from the continental United States. Instead, five regional banks accounted for 97% of the state’s total deposits in 2022. Bank of Hawaii (NYSE:BOH) took the No. 2 spot with 33.4% of deposits.This gives the Bank of Hawaii two advantages when compared to most American banks. First, it consistently earns higher profit margins thanks to the relative lack of competition in its market. Second, Bank of Hawaii’s deposit base should remain stable despite the current industry jitters, as Hawaiians have fewer banks to choose from.Despite these positives, traders have hammered BOH stock. Shares are down 46% this year and trading for less than 8 times earnings compared with a five-year average of 14.8. They also throw off a generous 6.7% dividend yield, meaning investors get paid to wait for a recovery in this cheap bank stock.Zions Bancorporation (ZION)Skis basking in the sun atop a snow-covered mountain.Source: ShutterstockZions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) is a unique commercial-focused bank operating primarily in Rocky Mountain states such as Utah. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, it operates as a commercial bank, providing services to small- and mid-sized businesses. These business owners, in turn, tend to maintain non-interest-bearing accounts at Zions as part of their customer relationship, which gives them access to loans and lines of credit from Zions.This context is important because it highlights Zions’ strong position. It has an unusually high percentage of its deposit base — nearly 45% — where it doesn’t have to pay interest thanks to having commercial rather than retail deposits. Meanwhile, its loan book should reprice quickly and make Zions more money since its assets aren’t tied up in longer-duration loans.ZION stock is down 40% this year as investors were quick to turn their backs on even the strong regional banks. This puts shares at less than 6 times forward earnings while offering a 6% dividend yield.I’m not the only one seeing stark undervaluation in Zions. Morningstar analyst Eric Compton believes ZION stock is worth $58 a share, nearly double the current price.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ZION and GS stock.

It may pay handsome dividends down the line.I bring this up after stumbling on a stunning stat on PepsiCo in prepping for the company's earnings last week: PepsiCo hasn't missed analyst earnings estimates since 2009.Let that sink in for a second. Despite all the ups and downs economically and politically around the world in 14 years, PepsiCo has basically not let investors down financially.Remarkable!I asked PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston about this otherwise crazy stat on Yahoo Finance Live 15 minutes after his earnings call ended (video above). His answer reinforced to me that there is more going on at PepsiCo than simply winning each quarter because it sells tasty soda and snacks to the masses globally.""One, we have a great portfolio of snacks and beverages, so good-sized categories to start with. In addition to that, I think we have a team and a culture here at PepsiCo just continuing to steadily grow with the categories. Growth in many ways is a real value inside of PepsiCo. We all think growth. You put that culture together, and you get the stock chart you see,"" Johnston said.He added, ""I think the best days are in front of us, not behind us.""Spotting whether a company has a good culture is incredibly difficult. A company could have a terrible culture and still put up amazing results if the demand for the product or service is robust. On the other hand, good cultures don't always lend themselves to great results.So how to spot a good culture driving good financial outcomes?I really think starting point one is pulling up a simple 10-year stock chart. If the line basically goes up and to the right (as is the case with PepsiCo), chances are the company is doing something right. From there it's going to require a lot more digging on job review sites, such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor, and a heavy dose of ingesting analysts' research.Story continuesThere are other ways I go about determining this as a journalist (such as watching how execs interact with people at conferences), but I am trying to make it easy for you investors at home.A culture investigation should be standard operating procedure when researching a company and deciding what to do with the stock.Because here is the rub right now: The stock market has run hard this year, and the performances of many companies won't live up to elevated expectations.Second quarter earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are seen as dropping 7.2% year over year, which would be the third consecutive quarterly decline. Energy, materials, and healthcare are forecast to show earnings declines of more than 20%.Sales are projected to decline slightly, the first fall since the third quarter of 2020.Net profit margins are barely expected to grow from the first quarter.These numbers suggest not all companies are winning in a climate of meh economic growth, currency volatility, and inflation that still doesn't resemble the Consumer Price Index (CPI) deceleration celebrated last week.We were reminded of this in the earnings from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup on Friday. Mixed performances at best.What companies do win in this environment? Culture champions in the mold of PepsiCo, and even a Delta that has displayed remarkably consistent execution under CEO Ed Bastian.The losers: Everyone else.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

63,961f17d6-3858-3130-aff5-a56f4230f3c1,WFC,2023-07-17,"JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-part-090000385.html,1689584400,STORY,"['JPM', '^GSPC', 'WFC', 'C']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 17, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC.Q2 Earnings Season: Good Start So FarThe market liked what it saw in the quarterly releases from JPMorgan, Citigroup and even Wells Fargo. There was plenty to like in these results, with the resilient economy helping keep credit demand positive and higher interest rates allowing them to charge more for those loans.The bank worries that took center stage in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco didn’t pertain to these big players. JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo, which reported Friday morning, and Bank of America, which is scheduled to report Tuesday morning (July 18th), regularly go through the Fed’s stress tests and are perceived as very safe.The diminished confidence in the banking space has been specifically centered on the small and mid-sized regional banks that will start reporting results this week. The flight to safety among depositors has forced these banks to offer much higher deposit rates to stem the tide. This will show up in net-interest margin pressures relative not only to what came through from the likes of JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo Friday morning but also relative to what these same banks had reported in the preceding period.We should also note that even the big players have to offer higher rates to depositors, pressuring their net interest margins. The Q2 net interest margin at JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells was still up from the year-earlier period but has notably leveled off relative to what they reported in the preceding quarter.Getting back to the group’s Q1 results, the fact that the investment banking business was weak in the period was no surprise for the market. This has been the trend for several quarters, as tighter monetary policy and other macroeconomic headwinds have weighed on deal-making. While there are some ‘green shoots’ on the horizon with respect to M&amp;A and IPO activities, no significant improvement is expected in these businesses until the macroeconomic ‘clouds’ lift.Story continuesJPMorgan’s net interest income jumped +44%, as average loans increased +13%, while the same at Wells Fargo increased +29% and +2%. JPMorgan benefited from the First Republic purchase, but the bank’s net interest income would still be up +38% when excluding the troubled lender’s distressed purchase.Net interest margin for these banks was up relative to the same period last year but was flat to modestly down on a sequential basis as they were forced to pay up for attracting and retaining deposits, which were modestly down at all three banks. Trends in deposits will be a major area that investors will be watching closely with the regional banks in the days ahead.Another area of potential read-through from these reports concerns commercial real estate exposure, which is a far bigger line of business for the regional operators than for the likes of JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo. Of these three, Wells Fargo is perhaps more relevant. The bank booked a $949 million increase in ‘reserves,’ a big part of which reflected the Wells’ commercial real estate exposure.Per Wells’ earnings release, “While we haven’t seen significant losses in our office portfolio to date, we are reserving for the weakness that we expect to play out in that market over time.” Wells had booked $643 million in the preceding period and $235 million in the year-earlier period.Management’s commentary about the economic outlook reflected tentativeness, citing continued downside risks, though they acknowledged the economy’s resiliency. Given bankers’ inherent defensiveness, the absence of ‘hurricanes’ in Jamie Dimon’s comments is seen as positive and reassuring.Bank stocks have notably lagged the broader market, particularly since the onset of regional bank worries in March.The issue with the bank stocks isn’t so much their current earnings power but rather how their profitability will shape up in the coming economic slowdown. Bank investors are wary of the group’s track record of making a lot of money during the good times, which the group then gives back during the bad times. The question is how ‘bad’ will the coming ‘bad times’ be for the economy and what will that do to bank earnings.Regarding the Finance sector scorecard for Q3, we now have results from 18.6% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up +25.2% from the same period last year on +18.9% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 50% beating revenue estimates.Looking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q2 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +12% on +7% higher revenues.For the Zacks Major Banks industry, which includes all of the aforementioned banks and accounts for roughly 40% of total Finance sector earnings, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +14.2% from the same period last year on +11.5% higher revenues.As noted earlier, skeptics of the banking industry argue that the group gives away all the profits it had accumulated during the good times when the macro environment turns south. The Covid downturn was an anomaly in that respect, but there is some truth to the allegation.We will see how the economic picture unfolds in the coming quarters. Still, the credit quality metrics in the reported Q2 results do not point towards a material deterioration, even though delinquencies have started rising from the record low levels of the Covid years.The earnings growth picture for the Finance sector is expected to improve in 2023 as we turn the page on tough comparisons, even though the economic growth pace is expected to moderate under the cumulative weight of the Fed’s tightening. Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +8.5% in 2023, following the -16.1% earnings decline in 2022.The Earnings Big PictureRegular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have consistently been flagging a favorable turn in the revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, with earnings estimates stabilizing in the aggregate after consistently coming down for almost a year and actually starting to go up for some key sectors.It is this combination of favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) that appears to be driving market optimism.To get a sense of what is currently expected, look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q2 and the following three quarters and actual results for the preceding four quarters.Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. We should point out here that a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be only down -3.8% on +2.9% higher revenues.2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Basic Materials, Construction, Energy, Medical, Conglomerates, Autos, Aerospace, and Tech sectors.On the positive side, the Finance sector is the only one expected to experience significant margin gains, with the Consumer Discretionary and Transportation sectors as distant second and third. Sectors expected to be essentially flat margins relative to 2022 Q2 are Retail, Utilities, and Industrial Products.As noted earlier, the estimate revisions trend has notably stabilized since the start of Q2. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 have declined -1.05% since the beginning of April but only -0.4% on an ex-Energy basis. Importantly, estimates for sectors like Tech, Construction, Autos, and Transportation have actually increased in that timeframe.Q2 Earnings ScorecardIncluding this morning’s big bank results, we now have Q2 earnings season results from 30 S&amp;P 500 members. Total earnings for these 30 index members are up +5.9% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.The reporting cycle will start ramping up this week, with almost 150 companies coming out with Q2 results, including 57 S&amp;P 500 members. While a big part of this week’s line-up is comprised of banks, we do have some high-profile bellwethers coming out with results. These include Netflix, IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Tesla, and others.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Q2 Results Likely to Reflect a Stabilizing Earnings Picture  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

66,ca5c87ab-3a20-3f22-bd4f-f6e8df939423,IBM,2023-07-17,Should We Be Cautious About International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) ROE Of 9.5%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cautious-international-business-machines-corporations-120321753.html,1689595401,STORY,['IBM'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:9.5% = US$2.1b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (18%) in the IT industry classification.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. To know the 4 risks we have identified for International Business Machines visit our risks dashboard for free.Story continuesHow Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining International Business Machines' Debt And Its 9.5% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by International Business Machines, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.70. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The dividend yield is 1.3% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. View our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Before making this announcement, CSX was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 12.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 20% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendCSX Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.187 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.44. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.0% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.CSX May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. However, CSX's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year.Our Thoughts On CSX's DividendOverall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that CSX has the ability to continue this into the future. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for CSX that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

(NYSE:V) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Visa Visa Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Vice Chair, Kelly Tullier, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$6.1m worth of shares at a price of US$233 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$243. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 50% of Kelly Tullier's holding.Visa insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Visa Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Visa. Specifically, insiders ditched US$13m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Visa Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$250m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Visa Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Visa shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Visa is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Visa. While conducting our analysis, we found that Visa has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Marriott International Inc. MAR and DraftKings Inc. DKNG.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Top Stocks to Tap the Steady Fall in Inflation RateThe Fed’s decision to pursue stringent monetary policies and rigorous hike in the benchmark interest rate has started paying off. Inflation has declined steadily in the past year. The latest inflation data of June — the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) — have reaffirmed this trend.On Jul 12, the Department of Labor reported that CPI increased 0.2% month-over-month in June compared with the consensus estimate of 0.3%. CPI rose 0.1% month over month in May. Year over year, CPI rose 3% in June, lower-than-the consensus estimate of 3.1%. This marked the lowest annual reading of CPI since April 2021.Notably, the headline CPI reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Thereafter, it has shown a sharp fall. Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) also rose 0.2% month over month in June, below the consensus estimate of 0.3%. In May, core CPI was up 0.4% month over month.Year over year, core CPI climbed 4.8% in June, lower-than-the consensus estimate of 5%. This marked the lowest year-over-year increase in core CPI since October 2021. However, the data remained elevated to the Fed’s target rate of 2%.On Jul 13, the Department of Labor reported that PPI increased 0.1% month-over-month in June compared with the consensus estimate of 0.2%. Core PPI decreased 0.2% month over month in June in contrast to the consensus mark of a rise of 0.1%. In May, core PPI increased 0.1%.Story continuesA steady decline in the inflation rate may compel the central bank to move toward the end of the current rate hike cycle. Notably, the Fed paused the interest rate hike in the June FOMC meeting after 10 consecutive increases.Top PicksA lower interest rate is expected to benefit growth-oriented sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary.

If you pick the right individual stock, you could easily snag that type of return. In fact, some stocks can double your money even faster, as Tesla, Nvidia, Royal Caribbean Cruises and others have already demonstrated in 2023.Still, it’s important to remember that stocks that have the capability of doubling rapidly also generally carry a higher amount of risk than others. You should always consult with your financial advisor to ensure your risk profile matches the stocks that you want to buy.But, if you can handle the wild swings of a high-flying stock, take a look at the names below, each of which has the potential to double or even go higher still in the next five years.Enphase Energy (ENPH)Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $182.78Enphase Energy is an aggressive play that should either win big or lose spectacularly. For years — decades even — speculators have hoped, prayed and gambled that it was finally the time for solar stocks to take off.While solar as a whole is still in the starting gate, in terms of nationwide implementation, some stocks have already done spectacularly well. Enphase Energy is one of those companies, returning a whopping 2,500% over the past five years, even after an incredible drop of 46% from its all-time high in mid-2023.Still, Enphase Energy somehow remains under the radar of many investors. Analysts have a strong buy rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target 39% above current levels.Warning: Bank of America Says Stocks Are Headed for ‘Big Collapse’Tesla (TSLA)Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $271.99Story continuesTesla is one of the most controversial stocks in the market today, thanks in part to its outspoken genius of a founder, Elon Musk. But there’s no denying that the company has absolutely revolutionized the electric vehicle market, and it may only be beginning.Tesla is miles ahead of the competition when it comes to developing electric vehicles that are both desirable and profitable, and it’s dedicated to cutting the cost of EV production in half to further stem competition. Its advances in battery storage technology and the integration of artificial intelligence into its vehicle universe are just some of the cutting-edge technologies that will help the company going forward, and its recent deal to allow competitors to use its superchargers will be yet another big source of revenue.Note that the stock is notoriously volatile and already has had a huge run in 2023, so it’s a name you might want to average your way into over time.Nvidia (NVDA)Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $439.05Nvidia has always been a popular stock on Wall Street, but the company’s stock price has absolutely exploded in 2023, up 189.5% YTD as of June 30. That was enough to make Nvidia the best-performing stock in the first half of 2023.Much of the rally was due to the fact that Nvidia has become the de facto poster child for AI. As the world’s leading producer of microprocessors that make advanced artificial intelligence functions possible, Nvidia is seen as the clear winner in a world seemingly destined to be saturated with AI.While some giveback is likely, it’s important to remember that Nvidia stock actually fell by more than 50% in 2022, making its two-year return less irrational. Over the next five years, Nvidia is likely to continue being the dominant player in the industry, perhaps propelling the stock to even more stratospheric gains.Chipotle (CMG)Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $2,077.10Chipotle Mexican Grill might not have the sizzle that some of the tech stocks on this list might, but it’s been a huge winner for long-term investors — and more seems to be in store. Over the past five years, the company’s share price has more than quadrupled; but, with the way the company innovates, there may be much more in store.Just recently, the company unveiled its avocado processing robot, dubbed Autocado, that peels, cores and cuts avocados before they are passed on to human workers for transformation into guacamole. The company claims this will cut processing time in half, translating into more production and higher sales. With a devoted fan base that continues to grow, Chipotle could continue its string of winning years.Alphabet (GOOGL)Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $118.98Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google, is forecast to post earnings growth of 11.1% next year, according to analysts at Bank of America.Already the world’s leading search engine, Alphabet is positioning itself to benefit from the rising AI wave. Google’s search results and the personalization of its core products like YouTube are already benefiting from AI and machine learning, and this will only accelerate in the future.The same is true of the company’s advertising and cloud computing businesses. But what many people may not know is that Alphabet runs much deeper than its headline-making businesses. AI can help many of its less well-known divisions, such as its life sciences and self-driving car businesses, make huge technological leaps in the coming years.Analysts maintain a strong buy rating on the company, which has posted a 102% gain — more than doubling — over the past five years.More From GOBankingRates4 Best Money Lessons From Elon Musk5 Places To Live in Europe That Are So Cheap You Could Quit Your Job3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,0009 Money Moves You Should Make This WeekThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Stocks That Could Make You Rich in the Next 5 Years]"
81,298f9f67-6f1e-30cc-8663-959a5f78522b,NVDA,2023-07-17,Have student loans? These employers will help you pay them off,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/student-loans-employers-help-pay-120016070.html,1689595216,STORY,"['NVDA', 'CHGG']","[Now that the Supreme Court has struck down President Biden's loan forgiveness plan, more companies are looking to offer student debt repayment as a benefit. (Joseph Cress / Associated Press)After graduating from college, Augie Kennady was saddled with nearly $90,000 in student loan debt.If he stuck to his loan servicer's payment plan, he'd be shelling out the equivalent of a high car payment every month for 25 years. But after joining educational services company Chegg in 2015 as a customer service representative, Kennady started participating in the Santa Clara, Calif., company's student loan repayment program.This employee benefit — which is offered by a small but growing number of companies — meant that Chegg contributed $23,000 toward the principal of Kennady's loan, allowing him to knock off valuable time from his repayments. With that help, Kennady redirected some of his income toward a down payment for a house, and it made him feel more loyal to the company.“It definitely affected my decision not to leave,” said Kennady, now Chegg's director of trust and safety. ""When you’re free from student debt, that gives you the opportunity to do other things to improve your life that you can’t necessarily do when you’re trapped under that burden.”Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against President Biden's plan to forgive millions of student loans, employer interest in this benefit is starting to heat up, especially as the number of open jobs continues to outnumber workers. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Education said it would cancel $39 billion of federal student loans for a smaller subset of borrowers who were enrolled in loan repayment plans based on their income.""If a lot of people had their debt forgiven, this benefit wouldn't have been as attractive,"" said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit research organization. ""It's going to be attractive to far more employees now because they still have the debt. It will give [employers] that potential competitive advantage.”Read more: Crushed student loan borrowers are skipping meals, moving in with parents, panicking over moneyStory continuesAs of 2022, U.S. borrowers owed a total of $1.75 trillion in student loan debt, a number that has been steadily increasing over the last five years, according to the Federal Reserve.Today, 21% of those who once attended college still owe money on their student loans, with the median debt between $20,000 and $24,999. An additional 21% of college attendees borrowed money but fully paid off their loans, according to the Fed.Although staffers on Capitol Hill have long been eligible for a congressional student loan repayment program, private employers only recently began offering this benefit. As early as 2015, a modest 3% of companies said they had this benefit, according to an annual employee benefits survey by the Society for Human Resource Management trade group of its U.S. members.Domenic Locapo's company started offering student loan repayment in 2016. At the time, Locapo had about $6,000 left to pay on the $40,000 worth of student loans he took out to pay tuition at Boston College.His company, then known as Kronos, paid $500 a year toward the loan's principal. He ended up paying off the loan three years early, in the fall of 2020.""That’s extra money back in my pocket,"" said Locapo, now 41, who serves as senior director of global public relations at HR software maker UKG, which became the company name after the 2020 merger between Kronos and Ultimate Software. ""Now I have two young children, so any extra savings we have … we just funnel back to our kids and their futures.”Santa Clara tech giant Nvidia started offering a student loan repayment program in 2017 after new hires who had recently graduated from college expressed concerns about the cost of student loans and the general cost of living, said Beau Davidson, vice president of employee engagement.Today, the program offers U.S. employees $350 a month, paid directly to their loan servicer, with a lifetime cap of $30,000 per worker. About 1.2% of the company's workforce participates in the program, which employees are eligible for from their first day on the job. Most are recent college graduates, but the program has no age limit and could be applied to loans for advanced degrees.“That was really helpful in terms of two fronts — helping existing college grads and helping us from a recruiting standpoint,"" Davidson said. ""Particularly in making sure that employees know right off the get-go that we’re really interested in their long-term success.""Read more: The pause on student loan payments is ending. Can borrowers find room in their budgets?Mathias Caetano paid off his student loans four years early through Nvidia's student loan repayment benefit.The San Francisco resident joined Nvidia in 2013, just weeks after graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with about $28,000 in student loan debt. He signed up for the company's student loan repayment program when it launched in 2016, and it helped him pay off his loans in three years.He's since become ""somewhat of an ambassador"" for the company's student loan repayment benefit to recent college graduates joining the tech company.""It just accelerated my personal finances in a way that allowed me to focus on just taking care of this,"" said Caetano, now 32, and a senior art director at the company. ""There was definitely that feeling ... that you’re cared for, that the company is caring for you.""New York Life Insurance Co. introduced its student loan repayment program in 2017 and now contributes $170 a month toward an employee's student debt for up to five years, which adds up to a maximum of $10,200 a person.The company has so far contributed more than $11 million, with more than 2,000 employees enrolled in the program since it began. More than 170 employees have paid off their loans, New York Life said.Interest in offering student loan repayment as a benefit surged in 2019, as employers looked to gain an edge in a competitive labor market. That year, 8% of employers surveyed said they offered student loan repayment to their employees, up from 4% the previous year, according to survey data from the Society for Human Resource Management.Even online brokerage E-Trade Financial got in on the action, acquiring student loan benefit firm Gradifi in 2019. (E-Trade was then acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020.)""Everyone thought [the] student loan benefit was really going to take off,"" Copeland said.Once the pandemic hit, momentum slowed. People were getting laid off, hours got cut and pay scaled back. Employers and employees focused instead on emergency savings, Copeland said.Interest ticked back up after then-President Trump signed a federal COVID-19 relief bill that included a provision allowing employer-provided student loan repayment or other educational expenses up to $5,250 a year to be considered a tax-free benefit through 2025.Manhattan Beach company Highway Benefits has seen the oscillating levels of interest throughout its 2 ½ years of existence. Founded in 2021, the company helps businesses offer student loan repayment as a benefit and provides the software platform and verification needed to move funds directly from employers to the loan servicer.""It's shifted from 'Yes, we have an interest, we'd like to learn about this,' to 'OK, how do we actually implement this?'"" said Mick MacLaverty, Highway Benefits' chief executive. ""It's been a little bit out of sight, out of mind for employees. But now that loans are resuming, student loan forgiveness via the Supreme Court did not go through, companies are looking for unique ways to attract and retain talent.""Student loan repayment options include matching contributions, direct payment as in the Nvidia and New York Life plans, in which companies contribute a set amount of funds per period to an employee's loan, and programs that combine 401(k) contributions with student loan payments.But the practice has also raised questions of fairness. Not every worker has student loans, and some employees will not get to reap the benefits, said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow and a higher education economist at the Urban Institute think tank.Having a program like this is also much cheaper for employers because they can say they offer this benefit, but only have to pay it out to a fraction of their employees, she said.Some companies such as UKG have evolved their student loan repayment programs to be more flexible and address some of these critiques. Instead of earmarking funds specifically for student loan repayment, the company reimburses the employee $350 a quarter for 100 different personal needs, including student loan repayment.For Locapo, the UKG spokesman who paid off his loans three years ago, that means he can put those funds toward his children's sports activities.Other companies have taken the approach that not every benefit will be useful to every employee.""We have lots of programs as a company that benefit some and don't benefit others,"" said Davidson of Nvidia. ""The folks who participate in this program have the same opportunity for salary advancement as the folks who don’t participate in this program.”Some companies have also used their participation as a way to signal their culture and values.Google launched its student loan repayment benefit in 2021 and said the program was part of the tech giant's commitment to racial equity, as student loan debt disproportionately affects women and people of color.Google matches up to $2,500 a year in payments toward the loan's principal.Connelly Partners ad agency, for example, said its student loan repayment program takes 10 years off the typical student loan in five years. The Boston company started its repayment benefit seven years ago after noticing that younger employees weren't participating in its 401(k) program. Since then, Connelly Partners has contributed nearly $338,000 to the program, and 75% of eligible employees participate in the benefit.“It was a great culture statement,"" Connelly said. ""We understood the stress young people are under with student loans. Our philosophical approach was, ‘OK.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.While the event attracted all the biggest domestic players, a single foreign sponsorship - from mobile chip designer Qualcomm - illustrated just how strained things have become for US tech giants trying to operate in China. The last conference before the pandemic in 2019 had IBM, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services as sponsors.This year's conference at least had one big foreign public figure who could make headlines: Tesla and SpaceX CEO and embattled Twitter owner Elon Musk. This may not be particularly surprising. With Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory being instrumental to its global supply of electric cars, Musk has immense business interests in China. In an eight-minute speech, Musk's enthusiasm for Chinese AI was on display.""China is going to be great at anything it puts its mind to. That includes ... artificial intelligence,"" he said at the conference.In a conversation on Twitter, Musk also said he believes China is on ""team humanity"" when it comes to AI development, although Republican congressman Mike Gallagher disagreed, saying they acted more like they were ""team genocidal communism"".Some US tech firms made low-key appearances, including representatives from Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. Still, much of the conference was a who's who of China tech, with all the names you are likely familiar with. Sanctioned tech giants Huawei and SenseTime were sponsors, alongside Tencent, Ant Group and Alibaba, owner of the Post.Story continuesAI has long been an area of interest for Beijing, which in 2021 specified it as one of seven ""frontier technologies"" to develop. The surge in popularity of ChatGPT, which launched in November, has since kick-started a new AI race, and it exposed how far behind China was in one particular area of the field: large language models (LLMs).At WAIC, vice-minister for industry and information technology Xu Xiaolan said China is developing an AI value chain from ""smart chips and algorithm frameworks to industry-specific large language models"".Sceptics have raised questions of whether censorship would impede China's development of generative AI, as the creativity of bots like ChatGPT relies heavily on ingesting a wide swath of content and producing unique, sometimes unexpected responses to queries. We covered that in a previous edition of Global Impact.But over the last several months, Chinese tech firms have been pouring resources into developing their home-grown LLMs and rolling them out in applications for consumer and commercial use. China now has more generative AI start-ups than any other country, reaching 22 by the end of the first half of the year, compared with 21 in the US, according to one Chinese research firm.Much of the country's AI activity is happening in Beijing, which is home to about half of China's 80 LLM.By the time WAIC rolled around this month, companies were eager to show what their work has wrought. Many exhibitors were showing off their own ChatGPT-like products catering to several different industries, including logistics, education, finance and construction.On the question of content controls affecting machine learning, Beijing believes it is a challenge that can be overcome. On Thursday, seven Chinese regulators introduced the world's most detailed regulations on generative AI, a provisional document that requires related products to ""adhere to core socialist values"" and encourages the generation of ""positive, healthy content"".Also this month, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology set up the China Electronics Standardisation Institute to establish LLM standards, and it enlisted the help of tech giants Baidu, Huawei, 360 Security and Alibaba.As with many new technologies, state media has warned of both risks and benefits of AI. In late June, the People's Daily said AI poses risks related to intellectual property rights, privacy and fraud, but it also said the technology would be ""an important driving force"" to ""industrial transformation"".The head of the Cyberspace Administration of China also said last month that AI must be ""reliable and controllable"".Big Tech has taken the hint. Alibaba's outgoing CEO, Daniel Zhang, who will remain head of the company's cloud computing unit, emphasised regulatory restraint in a speech last month.""Hitting the accelerator while also ... hitting the brakes for security are equally important,"" he said, using a metaphor that suggests the industry could be in for a bumpy ride ahead.Chinese tech firms have more than just regulations to contend with, of course. US restrictions on advanced chips used for AI applications are still in place and escalating, with reports that Washington is weighing restrictions on the use of cloud AI services.Some Chinese firms believe they have an edge in at least some areas. Baidu said the latest version of its Ernie Bot has surpassed ChatGPT in certain tasks conducted in Chinese.Going beyond the domestic market could be more difficult, but Hong Kong believes it could be a conduit for that. The city's financial secretary, Paul Chan Mo-po, made an appearance at WAIC, where he touted Hong Kong's strength in science and education. After his trip, Chan blogged that the government ""received a lot of positive responses"" about attracting investment from the mainland.Going global could be easier said than done for Chinese firms these days, though. Musk might be ""pro-China"", as he put it in his Twitter chat, but it is clear he is swimming against the political tide in his home country in that regard.China sets out new rules for generative AI, with Beijing emphasising healthy content and adherence to 'socialist values'Elon Musk says China is 'on team humanity', willing to work with US on existential AI threatsVenture veteran Lee Kai-fu jumps into China's AI race with new start-upChina's frenzy over ChatGPT-style services on full display at AI show despite Beijing's cautionChina leads world in number of generative AI start-ups to receive funding in first half of 2023, report findsHong Kong's financial secretary tells WAIC that city has a key role to play in China's AI developmentBeijing now home to half of China-developed AI models as more tech talent and investments head to the nation's capitalOpinion: What AI development might look like in China's socialist systemChina to create and implement national standard for large language models in move to regulate AI, while using its power to transform industriesIllustration: Henry Wong alt=Illustration: Henry Wong&gt;Will AI be China's ace in the hole to surpass the US and become the top economy?China's internet giants Baidu, Alibaba and Kunlun have been quick on the uptake after ChatGPT was unveiled last year, adding to the conflict in the US-China tech warIt has long been suggested China will overtake the US as the world's largest economy, but its weak recovery from the impact of the coronavirus has raised doubtsWhen the San Francisco-based OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT to the market in November, hailed as the so-called iPhone moment for artificial intelligence (AI), it cast a shadow across the Pacific.China's internet giants, though, have been quick on the uptake.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, Nvidia NVDA, Carnival Corp. CCL, PulteGroup Inc. PHM and Copart, Inc. CPRT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:The S&amp;P 500 Index reached 4,500 for the first time in more than 15 months as bulls continued to roar. A cooler-than-expected inflation report revived hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its interest rate increases. Additionally, favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) are driving market optimism.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, has risen 17.5% so far this year. We have highlighted four stocks from different sectors that have gained more than 50% this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These companies have also witnessed positive estimate revisions for the current fiscal year. These are Nvidia, Carnival Corp., PulteGroup Inc. and Copart, Inc.Technology remained the major outperformer, followed by the cyclical sectors. Inflation in the United States cooled down for the 12th consecutive month in June. The Consumer Price Index rose 3% year over year, marking the lowest rate since early 2021, and 0.2% over the last month. Although inflation has dropped from a peak of 9.1%, it is still significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target (read: 5 ETFs to Gain as Inflation Drops to a 2-Year Low).Easing inflation indicates that the economy is stabilizing and interest rates may be declining. This could boost investor confidence and encourage more investments in the stock market. Lower inflation often leads to lower interest rates, which can reduce borrowing costs for companies, potentially leading to higher profits and, in turn, higher stock prices. Economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace, with robust job gains and a low unemployment rate and moderated inflation.Story continuesConsumer confidence unexpectedly jumped to an 18-month high in June amid lingering fears of a recession. The U.S. housing sector has also shown immense improvement, with homebuilder confidence reaching its highest level in almost a year.Despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has raised rates this year, interest rates have largely remained low.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.SPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.5% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $421 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 79 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors. SPY has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).Below we have highlighted the above-mentioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.Best-Performing Stocks of SPYNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 214.6% so far this year.

NVDA, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Marriott International Inc. MAR and DraftKings Inc. DKNG.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Top Stocks to Tap the Steady Fall in Inflation RateThe Fed’s decision to pursue stringent monetary policies and rigorous hike in the benchmark interest rate has started paying off. Inflation has declined steadily in the past year. The latest inflation data of June — the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) — have reaffirmed this trend.On Jul 12, the Department of Labor reported that CPI increased 0.2% month-over-month in June compared with the consensus estimate of 0.3%. CPI rose 0.1% month over month in May. Year over year, CPI rose 3% in June, lower-than-the consensus estimate of 3.1%. This marked the lowest annual reading of CPI since April 2021.Notably, the headline CPI reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Thereafter, it has shown a sharp fall. Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) also rose 0.2% month over month in June, below the consensus estimate of 0.3%. In May, core CPI was up 0.4% month over month.Year over year, core CPI climbed 4.8% in June, lower-than-the consensus estimate of 5%. This marked the lowest year-over-year increase in core CPI since October 2021. However, the data remained elevated to the Fed’s target rate of 2%.On Jul 13, the Department of Labor reported that PPI increased 0.1% month-over-month in June compared with the consensus estimate of 0.2%. Core PPI decreased 0.2% month over month in June in contrast to the consensus mark of a rise of 0.1%. In May, core PPI increased 0.1%.Story continuesA steady decline in the inflation rate may compel the central bank to move toward the end of the current rate hike cycle. Notably, the Fed paused the interest rate hike in the June FOMC meeting after 10 consecutive increases.Top PicksA lower interest rate is expected to benefit growth-oriented sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary. We have selected five such stocks with strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

85,feb4e2d8-45ed-384b-a647-df45b0a1662b,CMI,2023-07-17,Bull of the Day: Cummins Inc. (CMI),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-cummins-inc-cmi-080000091.html,1689580800,STORY,['CMI'],"[Cummins Inc. (CMI) is a historic U.S. engine maker that’s benefitting from strong growth in its legacy segments and posting huge expansion in its future-focused Accelera unit that includes hydrogen technology and much more.Cummins posted back-to-back years of big revenue growth and its outlook for 2023 is equally impressive. On top of all that, CMI shares have soared roughly 20% since the start of June after it found support at a key long-term moving average.Cutting-Edge Old Tech and New Age Efforts The Indiana-based firm is one of the most well-known engine makers in the U.S., with a diverse and ever-growing portfolio of power solutions. Cummins’ products include diesel, natural gas, electric, and hybrid powertrains. CMI also makes powertrain-related components such as filtration, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems, brakes, suspension systems, and beyond.Alongside these wide-ranging offerings, Cummins is investing rather heavily in new-age technologies such as electric power generation systems, batteries, electrified power systems, electric powertrains, hydrogen production, and fuel cell products. The company also utilized its sturdy balance sheet to make some strategic forward-looking acquisitions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCummins last August bout Meritor to help it add a leading maker of electric powertrain solutions for both commercial vehicles and industrial markets. CMI then in November bought Siemens’ Commercial Vehicles business to help further accelerate its development of electrified power solutions.On top of that, Cummins back in October said it would start producing electrolyzers in the U.S. The move is part of its effort to drive forward the green hydrogen push, which the Federal government is actively supporting through spending and tax incentivizes.The next frontier that could make hydrogen fuel cell technology one of the most important players in a greener economy is figuring out how to make electrolyzing water into hydrogen and oxygen far more cost competitive. Cummins is aiming to become part of the pioneering class of clean hydrogen and other futuristic power.Story continuesRecent Growth and Outlook Cummins’ revenue climbed 21% in 2021 and 17% in 2022 to help it blow away its pre-covid levels at $28.07 billion in FY22 vs. $23.57 billion in FY19. The company’s growth is a bit less steady compared to some other segments of the economy. But that is par for the course for CMI because it is forced to navigate larger economic cycles that impact its customers’ decisions on when to buy its rather expensive offerings.The company’s New Power division has been rebranded to Accelera and includes batteries, fuel cells, hydrogen-production technologies such as electrolyzers, and more. It is still by far the smallest segment, but its sales soared 174% in the first quarter of 2023. Cummins also significantly upped its revenue guidance for 2023 in early May.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for CMI’s sales to climb another 17% in 2023 to reach nearly $33 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 31% this year to $19.80 a share. Cummins is projected to follow up this very impressive and tough-to-compete against stretch with top and bottom line growth next year as well. CMI’s earnings revisions have started to trend higher once again to help the stock land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Other Fundamentals CMI shares have crushed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, up roughly 1,700% vs. 390%.

That said, Cummins has roared back recently, up around 20% since the start of June after it found support right around its 200-week moving average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCMI is now back well above its 50-week moving average, and it is clear of both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages again as well. Despite the resurgence, CMI still trades roughly 10% below its own record highs at the moment.On the valuation front, Cummins trades at a nearly 40% discount to its own decade-long highs and 5% beneath its median at 12.7X forward 12-month earnings. This marks a 35% discount to its industry despite CMI’s massive outperformance over the last decade.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineCummins has boosted its dividend every year for more than a decade, including a 7.4% annualized increase over the last five years. The firm on July 11 increased its dividend by another 7% from $1.57 a share to $1.68 a share. The new payout would have it yield 2.7% to top its industry’s 1.1% average. If Cummins reports upbeat results and offers solid guidance when it releases its Q2 earnings in early August, CMI stock might be able to break out to new 52-week highs and start to mount a comeback toward its peaks. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Paramount Pictures, which distributed the film, had projected $90 million for that stretch.Previous installments of the Mission: Impossible took in $44.9 million to $78.8 million in their first five days, according to data provided by Comscore. International sales came to $155 million, the studio said in a statement Sunday.The picture has been one of the theater industry’s most-anticipated of the year. It scored positive reviews, with critic and audience scores sitting at 96% and 94%, respectively, on Rotten Tomatoes. Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick was the highest-grossing picture last year domestically.The second highest-grossing film of the weekend was Sound of Freedom, which has grossed more than $85 million over its two-week run.The low-budget action picture, in which a former US government agent rescues children from a sex trafficking operation in Colombia, is a major success story for the two-year-old distributor Angel Studios and sold more than twice as many tickets in the US and Canada this weekend as Walt Disney Co.’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which cost an estimated $300 million to make.In Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise races to find a powerful weapon that threatens to destroy humanity. He stars alongside Hayley Atwell and Ving Rhames.Story continuesA number of high-profile releases this summer have disappointed, including Disney’s Elemental and Warner Bros.’ The Flash. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts downgraded their predictions for the theater industry’s revenue to about $9 billion this year as a result. Before the pandemic, the domestic box office regularly topped $11 billion annually.Mission: Impossible cost $290 million to produce, a number high even by the standards of Hollywood blockbusters and one likely to fuel debate about whether budgets like that are sustainable given the ongoing weakness in ticket sales.The balance of summer moviegoing now rests on two highly anticipated releases next weekend, Warner Bros.’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer. Barbie is projected to bring in as much as $426 million domestically, and Oppenheimer as much as $194 million, according to Boxoffice Pro.--With assistance from Thomas Buckley.(Updates with final weekend totals.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsThis Supposed Mafia Manifesto Doesn’t Stand Up to a Google SearchWhat If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like ONEOK (NYSE:OKE). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for ONEOK How Fast Is ONEOK Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, ONEOK has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 40%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. ONEOK shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 14% to 17%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for ONEOK?Story continuesAre ONEOK Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Investors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.It's pleasing to note that insiders spent US$1.8m buying ONEOK shares, over the last year, without reporting any share sales whatsoever. The shareholders within the general public should find themselves expectant and certainly hopeful, that this large outlay signals prescient optimism for the business. It is also worth noting that it was President Pierce Norton who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$1.5m, paying US$60.96 per share.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for ONEOK bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$192m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.7% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.While insiders are apparently happy to hold and accumulate shares, that is just part of the big picture. That's because ONEOK's CEO, Pierce Norton, is paid at a relatively modest level when compared to other CEOs for companies of this size. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like ONEOK, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.ONEOK's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.1m in the year leading up to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is ONEOK Worth Keeping An Eye On?ONEOK's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. To make matters even better, the company insiders who know the company best have put their faith in the its future and have been buying more stock. These factors seem to indicate the company's potential and that it has reached an inflection point. We'd suggest ONEOK belongs near the top of your watchlist. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with ONEOK (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Keen growth investors love to see insider buying.

92,528b1583-e95d-3791-8c0a-050c56527631,CL,2023-07-17,Dividend Investors: Don't Be Too Quick To Buy Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-investors-dont-too-quick-122259344.html,1689510179,STORY,['CL'],"[Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Colgate-Palmolive's shares before the 20th of July to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.92 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Colgate-Palmolive has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current share price of $76.44. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Colgate-Palmolive can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Last year, Colgate-Palmolive paid out 98% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Colgate-Palmolive generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 79% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's good to see that while Colgate-Palmolive's dividends were not well covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company continues paying out such a high percentage of its profits, the dividend could be at risk if business turns sour.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. So we're not too excited that Colgate-Palmolive's earnings are down 3.4% a year over the past five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividend at approximately 4.5% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Colgate-Palmolive is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.To Sum It UpHas Colgate-Palmolive got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been in decline, which is not encouraging. Worse, Colgate-Palmolive's paying out a majority of its earnings and more than half its free cash flow. Positive cash flows are good news but it's not a good combination. Bottom line: Colgate-Palmolive has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Colgate-Palmolive. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Colgate-Palmolive and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Prologis PLD, Rexford Industrial Realty REXR, Americold Realty Trust COLD, EastGroup Properties EGP and Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Are Industrial REITs Poised to Grow Despite Normalizing Demand?The U.S. industrial real estate sector, while exhibiting signs of normalization following the extraordinary demand spike during the pandemic, continues to project healthy fundamentals. In this article we’ll delve deeper into the second-quarter performance in terms of demand, net absorption, leasing activity, vacancy rates and rents, and then further probe into the future outlook of this asset category.Finally, we will try to figure out how the four major Industrial REITs – Prologis, Rexford Industrial Realty, Americold Realty Trust and EastGroup Properties – are likely to have performed in the second quarter and what lies ahead for them.Industrial Real Estate Market Fundamentals in Q2Per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report, the industrial real estate sector is starting to normalize after two years of exceptional demand fueling a cumulative rent growth of 30% or more. Net absorption for the second quarter measuring 44.9 million square feet (msf) marks a decline from the heights of the previous year. However, it is still in line with the healthy pre-pandemic absorption levels.Leasing activity too mirrors this trend amid economic challenges. While gross new leasing of 141.1 msf is down 8.9% from the first quarter, it is still in line with the quarterly average experienced from 2015 to 2019. Moreover, the market is on track to surpass 500 msf for the eighth consecutive year. The rise in vacant sublease space in certain markets has had a moderating effect on the overall absorption figures.Story continuesThe second quarter saw a swift influx of new industrial supply, with a staggering 139.5 msf of new developments reaching completion. Amid this, the national vacancy rate increased 60 basis points to 4.1%, surpassing the 4% mark for the first time since mid-2021. Despite the rise, the vacancy rate remains well below the 10-year average, suggesting a resilient market.However, despite the softening market conditions, rents continued to rise. The second quarter asking rental rates increased 4.6% quarter over quarter, pushing the figure to $9.59 per square foot. In several markets, the healthy delivery of Class A speculative logistics space at a premium price is exerting upward pressure on prices.However, developers are dialing down amid the slowing demand, with the construction pipeline declining 5.1% quarter over quarter. Notably, the current speculative developments make up 83% of the pipeline, and only 19% of that space has been pre-leased by tenants.What Lies Ahead?Per the CWK report, construction completions are likely to outstrip demand in the second half of 2023 and 2024, pushing the vacancy rate to more than 5% by 2024. However, compared to the 15-year historical average of 6.6%, vacancy will still be considered tight, favoring landlords.The report also expects absorption totals to hover marginally below pre-pandemic levels in 2023 and 2024 as softer demand for consumer goods merges with the challenges of high inflation and interest rates. Despite this, net absorption is expected to remain in the positive territory in both 2023 and 2024, indicating the enduring resilience of this sector amidst prevailing economic challenges.Moreover, going forward, rents are projected to trend higher, albeit at a slower pace. While annual growth is expected to decline and be within the 10-11% range in 2023 and slow further to 3-4% in 2024, rents are still expected to surpass the $10 mark for the first time ever in 2024.Stock DiscussionPrologis: Prologis is a global leader in logistics real estate, with a portfolio that spans 19 countries. While the company might face challenges amid slowing demand and rising vacancies, its sturdy portfolio indicates a promising mid to long-term performance. PLD is likely to show resilience in terms of rental growth and occupancy rates.Moreover, its strategic buyouts and solid balance sheet bode well. In October 2022, Prologis closed on the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets. In late June, Prologis announced an agreement to acquire close to 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone in a cash-funded transaction valued at $3.1 billion.PLD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It is scheduled to release its earnings on Jul 18 before market open. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLD’s second-quarter 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.67 indicates a whopping 50.4% increase from the year-ago reported number. For 2023, the consensus mark for the same is $5.48, suggesting a 6.2% increase year over year. For 2024, FFO per share is expected to rise 2.1%.Rexford Industrial Realty: REXR is focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California, a region characterized by high demand and limited supply. REXR's strategic positioning in the supply-constrained Southern California, coupled with its focus on infill properties, could provide stability amidst the sector-wide cool-down. The region's potential for premium rents presents a promising outlook.REXR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is slated to release its earnings on Jul 19 after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REXR’s second-quarter 2023 FFO per share of 54 cents indicates a 10.2% increase year over year on a 27.6% projected increase in revenues. For 2023, the consensus mark for FFO per share is $2.19, which suggests an 11.7% increase year over year on a 21.8% rise in revenues. For 2024, FFO per share is projected to increase 15.4%.Americold Realty Trust: As the world's largest publicly traded REIT focused on temperature-controlled warehouses, COLD benefits from the rising demand for cold storage facilities. COLD, with its temperature-controlled warehouses, could fare well in the changing market conditions. The need for cold storage is unlikely to wane, which suggests a strong demand for its specialized real estate assets.COLD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and is scheduled to release earnings on Aug 3 after market close.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for COLD’s second-quarter 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally down in the past month to 24 cents, the same for the third and the full-year 2023 climbed north over the past month to 31 cents and $1.21, respectively. It has a long-term growth rate of 9.5%, which is ahead of the industry average of 6.7%.EastGroup Properties: EGP is a self-administered equity REIT focused on the development, acquisition and operation of industrial properties. EGP's focus on high-growth Sunbelt markets and diversified tenant base might alleviate the effects of the overall slowing demand.EGP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and is scheduled to release earnings on Jul 25 after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EGP’s second-quarter 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally north over the past two months to $1.88, implying a 9.3% increase year over year. For 2023, the consensus mark for the same has climbed marginally to $7.56, suggesting an 8% increase year over year. For 2024, FFO per share is projected to increase 6.5%.Parting ThoughtsWhile the industrial real estate market cools offs, the underpinning fundamentals and continuing healthy demand paint a promising picture. Investors should remain optimistic about the resilience of this sector and consider the compelling opportunities offered by Industrial REITs like PLD, REXR, COLD, and EGP. The specific geographic focus and property types of these REITs may provide stability and potential returns during the market's normalization phase.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Monique Herena, for US$2.6m worth of shares, at about US$173 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$173. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was 53% of Monique Herena's stake.In total, American Express insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like American Express better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$175m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The American Express Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of American Express insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.But note: American Express may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The oldest holding is Coca-Cola, which Warren Buffett bought in 1988. He famously loves Coke and supposedly used to drink 5 to 6 cans a day.35 Years in Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company KO is now Berkshire’s 5th largest position, as the company keeps adding to its Occidental Petroleum position and that is now the third largest.Thirty-five years in one stock is impressive. From June 1, 1988 to July 11, 2023, Coca-Cola is up 2,420% without dividends. That beats the S&amp;P 500 which is up 1,605%.But Coca-Cola remains the only stock still in the Berkshire portfolio from the 1980s. Stocks from the 1990s are rare too.Long-Term Stocks are Rare in the Berkshire Portfolio1.       American Express Co. AXPAmerican Express was first bought by Berkshire Hathaway in 1994. It is another successful long-term position for the portfolio. Shares of American Express are up 2066% from the end of Q1 1994 to July 11, 2023 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 889% during that time (note, in the podcast, Tracey mistakenly says that it was up just 175%).Story continuesAmerican Express is currently a cheap stock. It trades at 15.6x forward earnings. Shares of American Express are up 18.1% year-to-date.But it remains the only stock bought in the 1990s red-hot bull market which is still in the portfolio. Why?2.       Moody’s Corp. MCOMoody’s is the 9th largest position in the Berkshire portfolio now. It was first added to the portfolio in the first quarter of 2001 so that means it has been in the portfolio for 22 years. That makes it the third oldest position.Moody’s has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500, gaining 2122% since 2001 versus the S&amp;P 500 up 258%. Shares are also up in 2023, adding 26.2%. Moody’s is no longer a value stock by P/E as it trades at 35x.Should it matter that Moody’s is no longer an actual value?3.       The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PGStocks from the early 2000s are now rare in the Berkshire portfolio as Buffett has sold many of his banks that he bought in that time period. But Procter &amp; Gamble was added in the first quarter of 2005, so that means Berkshire has owned it for 18 years.Procter &amp; Gamble has underperformed however. It’s up just 148% in those 18 years compared to 278% for the S&amp;P 500, without dividends. Procter &amp; Gamble is not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.4.Will Procter &amp; Gamble make it to the 20-year mark?4.       Amazon.com, Inc. AMZNDo you know that Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon? It bought them in the first quarter of 2019. It hasn’t added to the position, nor has it sold any of Amazon, in that four-year period.Amazon hasn’t been a great investment for the portfolio, so far. It’s up 33.5% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 and July 11, 2023. The S&amp;P 500 is up 51.8% during that period.Will Amazon be a forever stock for Berkshire Hathaway?Should You Really Hold a Stock for Forever?

But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) share price is 38% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 15% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 8.9% higher than it was three years ago.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 1 year and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year Zimmer Biomet Holdings grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 38%. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 38% increase in the share price. This makes us think the market hasn't really changed its sentiment around the company, in the last year. It makes intuitive sense that the share price and EPS would grow at similar rates.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Zimmer Biomet Holdings has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Zimmer Biomet Holdings will grow revenue in the future.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Zimmer Biomet Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 39% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 6% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Zimmer Biomet Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Zimmer Biomet Holdings  that you should be aware of.Story continuesOf course Zimmer Biomet Holdings may not be the best stock to buy.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty Ulta Beauty's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Ulta Beauty's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 48%. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Ulta Beauty maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 16% to US$10b.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. To be specific, they have US$33m worth of shares. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 0.1%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Should You Add Ulta Beauty To Your Watchlist?Ulta Beauty's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest.

The oldest holding is Coca-Cola, which Warren Buffett bought in 1988. He famously loves Coke and supposedly used to drink 5 to 6 cans a day.35 Years in Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company KO is now Berkshire’s 5th largest position, as the company keeps adding to its Occidental Petroleum position and that is now the third largest.Thirty-five years in one stock is impressive. From June 1, 1988 to July 11, 2023, Coca-Cola is up 2,420% without dividends. That beats the S&amp;P 500 which is up 1,605%.But Coca-Cola remains the only stock still in the Berkshire portfolio from the 1980s. Stocks from the 1990s are rare too.Long-Term Stocks are Rare in the Berkshire Portfolio1.       American Express Co. AXPAmerican Express was first bought by Berkshire Hathaway in 1994. It is another successful long-term position for the portfolio. Shares of American Express are up 2066% from the end of Q1 1994 to July 11, 2023 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 889% during that time (note, in the podcast, Tracey mistakenly says that it was up just 175%).Story continuesAmerican Express is currently a cheap stock. It trades at 15.6x forward earnings. Shares of American Express are up 18.1% year-to-date.But it remains the only stock bought in the 1990s red-hot bull market which is still in the portfolio. Why?2.       Moody’s Corp. MCOMoody’s is the 9th largest position in the Berkshire portfolio now. It was first added to the portfolio in the first quarter of 2001 so that means it has been in the portfolio for 22 years. That makes it the third oldest position.Moody’s has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500, gaining 2122% since 2001 versus the S&amp;P 500 up 258%. Shares are also up in 2023, adding 26.2%. Moody’s is no longer a value stock by P/E as it trades at 35x.Should it matter that Moody’s is no longer an actual value?3.       The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PGStocks from the early 2000s are now rare in the Berkshire portfolio as Buffett has sold many of his banks that he bought in that time period. But Procter &amp; Gamble was added in the first quarter of 2005, so that means Berkshire has owned it for 18 years.Procter &amp; Gamble has underperformed however. It’s up just 148% in those 18 years compared to 278% for the S&amp;P 500, without dividends. Procter &amp; Gamble is not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.4.Will Procter &amp; Gamble make it to the 20-year mark?4.       Amazon.com, Inc. AMZNDo you know that Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon? It bought them in the first quarter of 2019. It hasn’t added to the position, nor has it sold any of Amazon, in that four-year period.Amazon hasn’t been a great investment for the portfolio, so far. It’s up 33.5% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 and July 11, 2023.

109,f9aa65ad-de3b-38e2-8e31-7bbc59e99c93,LYB,2023-07-17,The 7 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks to Buy for July 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-reliable-dividend-stocks-002750803.html,1689035270,STORY,"['XOM', 'PFE', 'SON', 'HPQ', 'LYB', 'MAN', 'EPM']","[With the potential for rough waters to materialize, investors may want to think ahead with the most reliable dividend stocks to buy. Sure, on paper, the headline print seems to be moving in the right direction. Primarily, the official June jobs report came in at 209,000 new employment positions added, lower than the anticipated 240,000. In other words, the economy is gradually slowing, which helps the disinflation cause.However, not everything has gone according to what the Federal Reserve desires. Notably, the pace of wage growth remained steady, whereas economists had hoped for a decline. Also, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.6% from 3.7% in May. Stated differently, disinflation is not occurring fast enough. Therefore, the Fed may raise the benchmark interest rate again, which may bode well for July dividend stocks.Here’s the thesis: the Fed may overdo it with its rate hikes, which may spark a sharp downturn rather than gentle disinflation. Plus, higher borrowing costs won’t benefit risk-on assets. Instead, they’ll favor consistent dividend stocks, if anything. Ultimately, then, you may want to consider the below passive income providers for protection.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHP (HPQ)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comFeaturing a product and service portfolio of personal systems, printers, and 3D printing solutions, HP (NYSE:HPQ) may be more relevant than some folks give it credit for. Despite any reservations that investors may have about HPQ, it objectively makes a case for reliable dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the company carries a forward yield of 3.37%, well above the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%.Significantly, the forward payout ratio – or the metric used to determine if a company’s earnings can support the current dividend payment amount – sits at 29.23%. That’s quite low, bolstering confidence regarding yield sustainability. Also, HP commands 13 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. That’s a status management won’t want to give up too cheaply.Story continuesFinancially, HP also makes a compelling argument for July dividend stocks. Operationally, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9% on a per-share basis, above 80.14% of its peers. Also, the market prices HPQ at a forward multiple of 8.57. As a discount to projected earnings, HP ranks better than 88.31% of the competition.Sonoco Products (SON)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA U.S.-based international provider of diversified consumer packaging, industrial products, protective packaging, and packaging supply chain services, Sonoco Products (NYSE:SON) offers broad relevancies. That’s part of the reason why it qualifies as one of the reliable dividend stocks. While boring, its business is unlikely to go out of style anytime soon.Regarding passive income, Sonoco features a forward yield of 3.57%. In contrast, the materials sector’s average yield is only 2.82%. Just as importantly, Sonoco’s forward payout ratio sits at 34.19%, assuaging concerns about yield sustainability. Further, the company commands 41 years of consecutive dividend increases. It’s not just a Dividend Aristocrat. Rather, it’s well on its way to becoming a Dividend King.Financially, Sonoco carries a solid operational profile. Its Piotroski F-Score is 7 out of 9, reflecting decent operational efficiency. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 11.4%, above 70.17% of its peers. Even with these performance stats, SON is undervalued. Therefore, it makes a great case for (relatively) high-yield dividend stocks.Exxon Mobil (XOM)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA stalwart in the hydrocarbon space, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is no stranger to the category of reliable dividend stocks. Sure, critics can point to the burgeoning electric vehicle market as a possible existential challenge to big oil. I don’t see it, in part because EVs at large scale will almost surely require an infrastructure overhaul.At the moment, that’s just too expensive. For now, investors can rely on its forward yield of 3.53%. While this stat sits below the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%, Exxon’s payout ratio is 39.63%. Therefore, prospective investors won’t have to worry about yield sustainability (barring an apocalyptic event). Also, Exxon features 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, that’s a status management that won’t give up too cheaply.Financially, Exxon offers a well-balanced profile. It features significant strengths in the balance sheet, as evidenced by its Altman Z-Score of 5.15. Also, its Piotroski F-Score clocks in at 9 out of 9, reflecting excellent operational efficiency. Thus, it’s one of the consistent dividend stocks to buy.ManpowerGroup (MAN)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the largest staffing firms in the world, ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) makes for one of the most reliable dividend stocks, at least in my opinion. To be sure, I’m probably in the minority that thinks this way. However, with fears associated with the Covid-19 crisis firmly in the rearview mirror, employers are increasingly skeptical about the benefits of remote operation. Also, with layoffs rising, more enterprises will be discerning about their hiring.ManpowerGroup can leverage its acumen and provide real value to its enterprise-level clients. Better yet, the company can also provide value to its shareholders through its forward yield of 3.7%. Conspicuously, this rate ranks much higher than the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. As well, MAN’s forward payout ratio lands at 39.74%. Finally, it prints 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.On a financial note, the challenges of the post-Covid environment presented headwinds to ManpowerGroup’s operations. However, right now, the market prices MAN at a forward multiple of 12.37. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 64.67% of the competition.Evolution Petroleum (EPM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAn oil and gas company, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) states on its corporate profile that it focuses on delivering a sustainable dividend yield to its shareholders through the ownership, management, and development of producing hydrocarbon properties onshore in the U.S. As stated with Exxon Mobil, the fossil fuel industry may be much more relevant than folks give it credit for. Thus, EPM should be on your radar for reliable dividend stocks to buy.To be fair, Evolution Petroleum presents a riskier profile than its supermajor peers. That said, you’re probably not going to get a forward yield of 6.02% from the top dogs. Also, what should entice onlookers is the payout ratio of 45.71%, which offers much confidence for yield sustainability. If you’re looking for high-yield dividend stocks, it’s tough to ignore EPM.Turning to the financials, Evolution carries a robust balance sheet. Specifically, its cash-to-debt ratio clocks in at 93.81 times, better than nearly 83% of its peers. Also, it trades at a trailing multiple of 5.39, which is undervalued.LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA multinational chemical company, LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) represents the largest licensor of polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. It also produces ethylene, propylene, polyolefins, and oxyfuels, per its public profile. Thanks to its broad industrial relevancies, LYB ranks among the reliable dividend stocks to buy.Let’s be honest: LyondellBasell probably won’t make the charts as the sexiest public enterprise. However, it just so happens to be one of the high-yield dividend stocks. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 5.52%. That’s well above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Also, with a payout ratio of 45.76%, it offers reasonable confidence in yield sustainability. Also, its 12 years of consecutive dividend increases are nothing to scoff at.Looking at its financials, it scores relatively highly for its operational prowess. Specifically, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 16.1%, above 69.56% of its peers. Just as importantly, the market prices LYB at a forward multiple of 10.01. As a discount to projected earnings, LyondellBasell ranks better than 74.36% of its rivals.Pfizer (PFE)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) obviously came to much prominence during the Covid-19 crisis. However, with fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus fading – even with mutations and new variants forming – Pfizer lost much relevance. Still, it can leverage its newfound biotechnologies, making PFE one of the most reliable dividend stocks to buy.Regarding passive income, Pfizer commands a forward yield of 4.62%. That’s notably higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 46.87%. While higher than the other consistent dividend stocks, it’s well within what most investors would consider a sustainable yield. Finally, on this point, Pfizer enjoys 12 years of consecutive dividend increases.On the financial front, the company enjoys a balanced and robust profile. Specifically, its three-year free cash flow growth rate pings at 34.7%, above 75% of its peers. Also, its gross, operating, and net margins land at rates much higher than the underlying sector averages. To close, the market prices PFE at a forward multiple of 10.6. As a discount to projected earnings, Pfizer ranks better than 76.19% of the competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

110,551c7218-575d-3c6e-aae2-9880ac33c037,UNH,2023-07-17,What is the Dow Jones?,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-jones-154327871.html,1689522207,STORY,"['^DJI', 'UNH', 'INTC']","[The Dow Jones index is made up of 30 large-cap stocks and is used to measure the performance of the equity market.There are several ways to measure the performance of the stock market, including using the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But what is the Dow Jones?To be exact, the Dow Jones, which is also known as the Dow or the DJIA, is a price-weighted index of 30 of the most traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. It measures the price action of these blue chip stocks, which helps show investors the direction of the stock market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been around since 1896, which makes it the longest benchmark of the U.S. stock market. There were originally 12 companies that made up the index – all industrial stocks – including General Electric (GE), with the Dow getting up to 30 members by 1928.The DJIA first began trading at 40.9 points, and didn't surpass the 1,000 level until 1972. Its all-time high of 36,585 was hit on Jan. 3, 2022.How does the Dow work?The Dow Jones has a unique aspect that makes it stand out from many of the other indexes that track the U.S. stock market. Specifically, the DJIA is price-weighted, rather than capitalization-weighted.What does this mean?While indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 allow for higher weightings based on a component's market capitalization, or market value, the Dow gives greater weighting to stocks with higher share prices. And those stocks have a greater impact on the movement of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.For example, the current share price for healthcare stock UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is around $480, while semiconductor stock Intel (INTC) trades closer to $33. This means that UNH has an outsized weighting (8.6%) in the Dow vs INTC (0.6%), and its price movements have a greater sway on the Dow index performance.So, say for instance UnitedHealth rises by $10 and INTC moves up by just $5, UNH stock will have a two times greater influence on the index performance. However, the percentage change for UNH stock is only about 2% compared to a more than 15% move for Intel.Story continuesMeanwhile, Apple (AAPL), with its $3 trillion market capitalization, is seven times the market cap of UnitedHealth, but its weighting in the Dow is less than half of UNH. But in the S&amp;P 500, AAPL's weighting is 7.5% vs 1.1% for UNH and 0.4% for INTC given it is a market-cap weighted index.Some have criticized the Dow for this type of disparity in market caps. Nevertheless, over time, higher-priced stocks in the Dow have tended to correlate with higher market caps.Why is the Dow important?The actual calculation of the DJIA performance is more complex than this. As a result, this has helped the Dow index gain a dedicated following as an authentic representation of the market’s performance.Still, many institutional investors and index investors prefer to mimic market-cap weighted indexes like the S&amp;P 500 rather than the Dow. But the DJIA remains a key indicator of the health of not only the stock market, but also the economy, as the companies included in the index tend to be industry leaders with both positive and stable earnings.Can I invest in the Dow Jones?While investors cannot trade the Dow directly because it is an index, meaning it strictly measures the average price of the stocks it tracks, there are ways to gain exposure to it.For one, investors can buy shares in the individual Dow stocks.Investors can also easily purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index. Some of the best ETFs to do this include the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) and the iShares Dow Jones US (IYY).Related contentBull Markets vs Bear Markets: The Differences ExplainedPenny Stocks: Why You Should Always Stay AwayWhat is an Index Fund?]"

It trades at 15.6x forward earnings. Shares of American Express are up 18.1% year-to-date.But it remains the only stock bought in the 1990s red-hot bull market which is still in the portfolio. Why?2.       Moody’s Corp. MCOMoody’s is the 9th largest position in the Berkshire portfolio now. It was first added to the portfolio in the first quarter of 2001 so that means it has been in the portfolio for 22 years. That makes it the third oldest position.Moody’s has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500, gaining 2122% since 2001 versus the S&amp;P 500 up 258%. Shares are also up in 2023, adding 26.2%. Moody’s is no longer a value stock by P/E as it trades at 35x.Should it matter that Moody’s is no longer an actual value?3.       The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PGStocks from the early 2000s are now rare in the Berkshire portfolio as Buffett has sold many of his banks that he bought in that time period. But Procter &amp; Gamble was added in the first quarter of 2005, so that means Berkshire has owned it for 18 years.Procter &amp; Gamble has underperformed however. It’s up just 148% in those 18 years compared to 278% for the S&amp;P 500, without dividends. Procter &amp; Gamble is not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.4.Will Procter &amp; Gamble make it to the 20-year mark?4.       Amazon.com, Inc. AMZNDo you know that Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon? It bought them in the first quarter of 2019. It hasn’t added to the position, nor has it sold any of Amazon, in that four-year period.Amazon hasn’t been a great investment for the portfolio, so far. It’s up 33.5% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 and July 11, 2023. The S&amp;P 500 is up 51.8% during that period.Will Amazon be a forever stock for Berkshire Hathaway?Should You Really Hold a Stock for Forever?

112,02942dff-87e9-4205-afdf-32ed4c6fc829,PEP,2023-07-17,Here's the secret to investing success this earnings season: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-the-secret-to-investing-success-this-earnings-season-morning-brief-100048680.html,1689588048,STORY,"['WFC', 'DAL', 'JPM', 'PEP', 'C']","[Think of a company's culture first as the numbers roll in this earnings season. It may pay handsome dividends down the line.I bring this up after stumbling on a stunning stat on PepsiCo in prepping for the company's earnings last week: PepsiCo hasn't missed analyst earnings estimates since 2009.Let that sink in for a second. Despite all the ups and downs economically and politically around the world in 14 years, PepsiCo has basically not let investors down financially.Remarkable!I asked PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston about this otherwise crazy stat on Yahoo Finance Live 15 minutes after his earnings call ended (video above). His answer reinforced to me that there is more going on at PepsiCo than simply winning each quarter because it sells tasty soda and snacks to the masses globally.""One, we have a great portfolio of snacks and beverages, so good-sized categories to start with. In addition to that, I think we have a team and a culture here at PepsiCo just continuing to steadily grow with the categories. Growth in many ways is a real value inside of PepsiCo. We all think growth. You put that culture together, and you get the stock chart you see,"" Johnston said.He added, ""I think the best days are in front of us, not behind us.""Spotting whether a company has a good culture is incredibly difficult. A company could have a terrible culture and still put up amazing results if the demand for the product or service is robust. On the other hand, good cultures don't always lend themselves to great results.So how to spot a good culture driving good financial outcomes?I really think starting point one is pulling up a simple 10-year stock chart. If the line basically goes up and to the right (as is the case with PepsiCo), chances are the company is doing something right. From there it's going to require a lot more digging on job review sites, such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor, and a heavy dose of ingesting analysts' research.Story continuesThere are other ways I go about determining this as a journalist (such as watching how execs interact with people at conferences), but I am trying to make it easy for you investors at home.A culture investigation should be standard operating procedure when researching a company and deciding what to do with the stock.Because here is the rub right now: The stock market has run hard this year, and the performances of many companies won't live up to elevated expectations.Second quarter earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are seen as dropping 7.2% year over year, which would be the third consecutive quarterly decline. Energy, materials, and healthcare are forecast to show earnings declines of more than 20%.Sales are projected to decline slightly, the first fall since the third quarter of 2020.Net profit margins are barely expected to grow from the first quarter.These numbers suggest not all companies are winning in a climate of meh economic growth, currency volatility, and inflation that still doesn't resemble the Consumer Price Index (CPI) deceleration celebrated last week.We were reminded of this in the earnings from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup on Friday. Mixed performances at best.What companies do win in this environment? Culture champions in the mold of PepsiCo, and even a Delta that has displayed remarkably consistent execution under CEO Ed Bastian.The losers: Everyone else.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.
