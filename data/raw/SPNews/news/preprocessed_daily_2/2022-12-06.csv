Quarterly adjusted net income of C$4.07 billion ($3.06 billion) increased 5.1% from the prior-year quarter.The company recorded a rise in net interest income on the back of higher interest rates and rising loan demand. Also, the company’s balance sheet position was solid during the quarter. However, an increase in expenses and higher provision for credit losses were major headwinds.After considering several non-recurring items, net income was C$6.67 billion ($5.01 billion), increasing 76.4% year over year.Adjusted Revenues &amp; Expenses RiseQuarterly adjusted revenues were C$12.25 billion ($9.21 billion), increasing 11.9% on a year-over-year basis.Net interest income jumped 21.8% year over year to C$7.63 billion ($5.74 billion). Non-interest income of C$7.93 billion ($5.96 billion) increased 69.5% year over year.Adjusted non-interest expenses rose 9% year over year to C$6.43 billion ($4.83 billion).The adjusted efficiency ratio was 52.5% as of Oct 31, 2022, down from 53.9% recorded in the prior-year period.In the reported quarter, Toronto-Dominion recorded a provision of credit losses of C$617 million ($463.8 million) against a recovery for credit losses recorded in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet Strong, Capital Ratios Improve, Profitability Ratios WeakenTotal assets were C$1.92 trillion ($1.41 trillion) as of Oct 31, 2022, up 4.2% from the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Net loans rose 5.1% on a sequential basis to C$831 billion ($609.5 billion) and deposits increased 2.4% to C$1.23 trillion ($0.90 trillion).As of Oct 31, 2022, the common equity Tier I capital ratio was 16.2%, up from 15.2% on Oct 31, 2021. The total capital ratio was 20.7% compared with the prior year’s 19.1%.Toronto-Dominion’s return on common equity (on an adjusted basis) was 16%, down from 16.1% as of Oct 31, 2021.Story continuesKey Developments During the QuarterIn August, TD entered an agreement to acquire Cowen Inc. COWN in an all-cash deal worth $1.3 billion or $39 for each share of Cowen’s common stock. The closing of the deal, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from Cowen’s shareholders and certain U.S., Canada, and foreign regulatory authorities, is expected in the first quarter of 2023.In relation to the deal, Toronto-Dominion sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW for $1.9 billion. This reduced TD’s ownership interest in Schwab from 13.4% to 12%.Notably, TD’s strategy with respect to its investment in SCHW has not changed and it has no intention to divest additional shares.When combined with the share sale, the acquisition of Cowen is expected to be neutral to Toronto-Dominion’s common equity tier 1 ratio, which is expected to be above 11% at closing.The deal is expected to be modestly accretive to TD’s 2023 adjusted earnings per share on a fully-synergized basis. Also, it will generate approximately 14% adjusted return on invested capital on a fully-synergized run-rate basis.Our TakeSupported by a diverse geographical presence, Toronto-Dominion’s efforts toward improving revenues and market share, both organically and inorganically, seem impressive. Also, rising interest rates will support the company’s financials.Toronto Dominion Bank The Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Toronto Dominion Bank The Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseToronto Dominion Bank The price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Toronto Dominion Bank The QuoteToronto-Dominion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap. The semiconductor industry is among the most popular and lucrative sectors in the world. With chips now starting to be heralded as the 'new oil', their ubiquity has ensured that the modern day world can not function without the valuable resource. Whether it is the smartphone in your hand, the computer on your desk, the engine control system in your car, or the large data centers that power your shopping experiences, chips are silently ticking away at the center of nearly every modern day convenience.Therefore, it is not surprising that the semiconductor industry itself has lucrative future estimates. For instance, a research report by Allied Markets Research believes that the industry was already worth $555 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21% to sit at a whopping $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm states that this growth will be driven by the growth in consumer electronics, particularly due to the growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets spurred by the proliferation of fifth generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence are now playing a central role in how major companies operate throughout the globe, and their computational requirements are also expected to spur the demand for advanced semiconductors.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has an even more optimistic growth outlook for the chip sector. It estimates that the industry was worth $528 billion in 2021, and from then until 2029, it will grow at a strong CAGR of 12.2% to be worth $1.3 trillion by as early as 2029. Fortune Business concurs with Allied Markets in the belief that IoT will spur growth, but it goes on to add that China will be the fastest growing region as larger chunks of its population gain smartphone access. The Chinese market already accounted for half of the semiconductor revenue pie in 2021, as it generated $289 billion worth of sales.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take look at the largest semiconductor firms in the world. You're likely to have come across several of them, due to regular media coverage for companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been spectacular. Over that time, we've been excited to watch the share price climb an impressive 597%. Arguably, the recent fall is to be expected after such a strong rise. The only way to form a view of whether the current price is justified is to consider the merits of the business itself. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.In light of the stock dropping 9.4% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return. Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Range Resources moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Range Resources has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Range Resources' TSR for the last 3 years was 602%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Range Resources shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 46% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

5,a859a014-b267-3ee1-8735-234a54b94bec,RRC,2022-12-06,U.S. Natural Gas: Analysis of the EIA's Weekly Inventory Data,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-natural-gas-analysis-eias-131501546.html,1670246101,STORY,"['EQT', 'NG=F', 'RRC', 'CRK']","[The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. The negative inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures plunged more than 14% week over week.Despite this, the market has been kind to natural gas in 2022, with the commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $10 for the first time since 2008. Natural gas stocks like Range Resources RRC, EQT Corporation EQT and Comstock Resources CRK have been some of the prime beneficiaries of the price appreciation.EIA Reports a Withdrawal Smaller Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 81 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the holiday-shortened week ended Nov 25, below the guidance of 88 Bcf decline per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.However, the decrease was above last year’s pull of 54 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2017-2021) average net shrinkage of 34 Bcf.The second draw of the winter heating season puts total natural gas stocks at 3,483 Bcf, which is 89 Bcf (2.5%) below the 2021 level at this time and 86 Bcf (2.4%) lower than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 106.4 Bcf per day, down 0.6 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to lower shipments from Canada, partly offset by an increase in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption slumped 13.7% to 108.6 Bcf from 125.9 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a weaker power burn and decreased residential/commercial demand on the back of above-normal temperatures.Natural Gas Logs a Big Weekly LossNatural gas prices tumbled last week, following the lower-than-expected inventory draw. Futures for January delivery ended Friday at $6.281 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 14.3% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization — for the first time in four weeks — is also the result of forecasts for milder weather and the extended shutdown of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. The latest models anticipate tepid temperature-driven consumption over the near term (with less extensive use of heaters across homes and businesses), which is a negative for prices.The one thing supporting natural gas is a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere.Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means that LNG deliveries are poised to rise further, especially with squeezed natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe, following leaks in the key Nord Stream pipeline.However, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out some of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by the Jun 8 blast and is expected to only partially restart by the end of December after several missed target dates. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Story continuesFinal ThoughtsDespite some hiccups in between, the natural gas market is still up almost 70% so far this year. While fundamental indicators continue to suggest strong price levels, the natural gas market is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather. As such, investors are rather unsure of what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, EQT and Comstock Resources.Range Resources: The upstream firm has a strong footing in the prolific Appalachian Basin. In the gas-rich resource, RRC has huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.Range Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of 151.5% for the current year. Valued at around $6.5 billion, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported EPS of $1.37 for the third quarter, reflecting a 0.7% surprise over consensus. RRC shares have climbed 45.2% in a year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EQT: EQT is primarily an explorer and producer of natural gas, with the primary focus on the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In terms of average daily sales volumes, EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the domestic market.The company has an expected earnings growth rate of 348.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EQT’s 2022 earnings has been revised 2.5% upward over the past 90 days. EQT — valued at around $14.7 billion — has soared 104% this year.Comstock Resources: The company is active in the Haynesville shale in North Louisiana and East Texas — a premier natural gas basin. As of now, CRK has a projected earnings growth rate of 218.1% for the current year.Comstock Resources, with a market capitalization of $3.9 billion, enjoys a Zacks Value, Growth and Momentum Style Score of A each, and an overall VGM Score of A.

In August 2022, ROAD announced the acquisition of Southern Asphalt, a bolt-on to its South Carolina platform, King Asphalt. This expands ROAD’s footprint into the dynamic Myrtle Beach metro area. The company has also added two hot-mix asphalt plants and more than 200 employees to serve an area that is considered as one of the fastest-growing markets in the nation, providing opportunities to bid on an attractive mix of public and commercial projects.With the recent acquisitions and the strategic sale of Daurity Springs Quarry, the company is all set to expand operations into two fast-growing markets while maintaining its year-end leverage ratio. CPI expects both of these new operations to be accretive to earnings in fiscal year 2023.Construction Partners’ organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the attractive Southeastern U.S. road construction/repair market are expected to help the company generate higher revenues.Story continuesPrice Movement &amp; Earnings ProspectOver the past six months, ROAD has gained 16.7% against the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry’s 4.2% fall. The company has been riding high on the back of solid demand for infrastructure services throughout end markets in both the private and public sectors, consistent execution of its business model, and a growth strategy that defies labor, inflation and supply-chain challenges.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNotably, earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 reflect 53.7% year-over-year growth. The same for fiscal 2024 reflects 48.4% year-over-year growth.

The company’s strong focus on the emerging market is also encouraging. Yet, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh heavily on Thermo Fisher's stock, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Thermo Fisher has outperformed its industry in the past year. The stock has lost 13.9% compared with the industry’s 18.6% decline.The company exited the third quarter with better-than-expected results on 14% core organic revenue growth (considering the impact of PPD revenue and excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing revenue). Organically, in Q3, North America grew in the low single digits and Asia Pacific grew in the same with China growing in the high single digits. Revenues in the Analytical Instruments Segment and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment showed strong year-over-year growth.Thermo Fisher has raised its 2022 guidance. The company has increased its revenue guidance to $43.8 billion (from the earlier projection of $43.15 billion), reflecting 11% to 12% core organic revenue growth over 2021. Adjusted earnings per share guidance has been raised to $23.01 (from earlier $22.93) per share.In third-quarter 2022, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three of its four end markets, categorized either by customer type or geography. Within the pharma and biotech end market, the company delivered growth in the mid-teens on growth across all businesses serving customers, highlighted by the bioproduction and pharma services businesses. In academics and government, Thermo Fisher grew in the mid-single digits, with good growth in biosciences and electron microscopy. Within industrial and applied, the company grew in the high teens during the quarter on broad-based growth in all its analytical instrument businesses including electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry.In diagnostics and healthcare, although the company registered a decline during the third quarter, the core business performance was strong, driven by microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses.Story continuesOn the flip side, Thermo Fisher’s diagnostics and healthcare end-market revenues in Q3 declined approximately 30%. Revenues in the Life Sciences Solutions segment declined 20.4% year over year. Strong growth in the bioproduction business was more than offset by a moderation in testing revenue within the segment as the pandemic subsided. The Specialty Diagnostics segment recorded a 21.8% year-over-year fall in revenues in Q3. Strong underlying growth in the transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses was offset by lower COVID testing revenues on a year-over-year basis.The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is also concerning.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Timothy Welsh, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$43.91. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$109m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About U.S. Bancorp Insiders?Insiders sold U.S. Bancorp shares recently, but they didn't buy any.

It's with Longroad Energy on Three Corners Solar, a $200 million, 152-megawatt solar project in Kennebec County, Maine. The deal, which also includes a tax equity investment, marks an important milestone in expanding U.S. Bank's commitment to the environment and supporting its customers.""We believe everyone has a role to play in creating a sustainable future and addressing climate change and we're excited about all the ways this will expand our abilities to do just that,"" said Darren Van't Hof, managing director of Environmental Finance for USBCDC. ""The renewable energy market continues to grow, and this new product will help us meet the needs of customers and the industry as well as deliver on the environmental commitments U.S. Bank has made.""The tax credit and community investment division of U.S. Bank, USBCDC invests renewable energy tax equity in projects that help provide clean energy options to our nation's homes, towns and businesses through wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. Since 2008, its investments have totaled over $15 billion in tax equity and a total renewable generating capacity of 20.21 gigawatts - enough to power more than 3,800 homes. The addition of lending means those numbers will only grow.""Our new project finance debt platform is a perfect example of how we can bring one U.S. Bank to deepen our relationships with new and existing customers,"" said Bill Gallagher, director of environmental project finance lending for USBCDC. ""Not only will it help us achieve our own commitment, but it will create opportunities to support customers across the bank - from utilities to developers - who are making their own transitions to a greener economy.""USBCDC closed a $100 million loan and made an $80 million tax equity investment in the Three Corners Solar project. It's the bank's fourth equity deal with Longroad and the first including debt.Story continues""Execution, certainty and quality is very important to Longroad. For years, U.S. Bank has been Longroad's trusted tax equity partner for its best-in-the-industry tax equity products and solutions,"" said Tait Nielsen, VP of project finance at Longroad Energy. ""With U.S. Bank's support, now both on the tax equity and lending side, Longroad is able to raise financing more efficiently and with greater confidence. We look forward to continuing and expanding our long relationship with U.S. Bank.""Rod Granados, USBCDC account manager, said Three Corners is a great first project to launch with. New England is a strong market for solar and the utility-scale project has a long-term power purchase agreement in place with EDF Energy Services, LLC. ""All the technology on this project is also sourced domestically, which avoids some of the recent supply chain issues and delays the industry has been experiencing,"" Granados said. Once complete, expected in late 2023 or early 2024, it will be the largest solar project in Maine.The new environmental project finance platform is also an important component in meeting the environmental commitments U.S. Bank has made. Last November it set an environmental finance goal of $50 billion by 2030 - advancing the transition to a low-carbon economy by financing more customers and projects that have a positive impact on the environment.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Walmart, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$24b ÷ (US$248b - US$101b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Walmart has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Consumer Retailing industry average of 9.6% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart roceIn the above chart we have measured Walmart's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Walmart here  for free.So How Is Walmart's ROCE Trending?Over the past five years, Walmart's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Walmart doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. This probably explains why Walmart is paying out 36% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesOn a side note, Walmart's current liabilities are still rather high at 41% of total assets. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.The Bottom LineIn a nutshell, Walmart has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 71% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Walmart, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should be aware of.While Walmart may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

16,5fd446a6-4b54-40b1-8cb1-a2f3a85cc47d,WMT,2022-12-06,How Costco keeps the peace with its employees,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-costco-keeps-the-peace-with-its-employees-124516498.html,1670330716,STORY,"['COST', 'WMT', 'AMZN', 'SBUX']","[Steady membership fees and cost savings helped fuel Costco (COST) to record membership renewal rates this year, driven in part by concerns about inflation.But the Issaquah, Washington–based company has quietly emerged as a leader on another critical issue that dominated the retail sector in 2022 — labor relations and the employee push to unionize.Rival retailers, meanwhile. have struggled to address employee demands for higher wages and better benefits while fending off efforts to organize. But Costco, Yahoo Finance's 2022 Company of the Year, has managed to separate itself from the pack, building on a reputation as one of the friendliest places to work in retail.According to data from Glassdoor, Costco employees rated the company a 4 out of 5, putting it well ahead of competitors like Sam’s Club and Target (TGT). Longtime CEO Craig Jelinek earned an approval rating of 85% from its staff, surpassing Amazon’s (AMZN) Andy Jassy and Walmart's (WMT) Doug McMillon.“They’ve set a higher entry-level wage, more full-time jobs, more access to employee benefits, and generally, probably better working conditions as well,” said William Brucher, an assistant teaching professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. “A lot of that has to do with Costco’s business model, in that it makes most of its profit on memberships.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.That base annual $60 membership fee has taken the pressure off of Costco to be a “low-road employer” according to Brucher, who said the discount retailer has consistently outpaced competitors when it comes to the number of full-time employees it hires. Costco cashiers earn, on average, $32,000 a year. While just one-fifth of hourly workers at Costco are unionized, they earn largely the same pay as their non-unionized workforce.In addition, employees who work for 180 consecutive days for more than 23 hours a week qualify for Costco’s health benefits plan, which includes medical care along with coverage for dental and vision with low co-pays, according to Glassdoor.Story continues“This is aimed at discouraging unionization in the nonunion warehouses, and so far that aim has been met,” said Professor Ruth Milkman, Labor Studies Chair for CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies. “Turnover is lower (typical whenever pay is higher) than in companies like Walmart; productivity is also higher - and probably morale. So Costco has developed a totally viable business model, and obviously one that is superior for the hourly employees.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.That stands in stark contrast to discontent brewing within hourly employees at chains like Starbucks (SBUX) and Amazon. For instance, warehouse workers at Amazon's Staten Island, New York, facility helped organize the company’s first-ever U.S. labor union this spring, but workers say the company has so far refused to come to the bargaining table or recognize the group as the Amazon Labor Union. While more than 300 Starbucks stores in roughly three dozen states have held union elections, the coffee chain has consistently pushed back against employee efforts, sending anti-union messaging to employees and isolating workers by announcing raises and benefits for nonunion employees.Costco has historically been more amenable to labor groups, in part out of necessity. When Costco merged with then rival Price Club in 1993, the firm inherited a handful of stores already unionized for the Teamsters.“We always want to make sure that our employees are at the higher end of the scale and we believe that they are at the top end,” said Jelinek in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “Of course, that starting wage is narrowed for everybody. But we wanna also pay for longevity. We do not want to turn people. We want to keep our employees.”But the tight labor market is starting to chip away at Costco’s leadership, as rival retailers raise their own wages and compensation to secure workers. Amazon, Walmart, and Sam’s Club now offer higher wages than Costco for cashiers and sales associates, putting pressure on the firm.Clackamas, OR, USA - Jun 8, 2021: The entrance to the Costco Wholesale Store in Clackamas, Oregon.This summer, roughly 18,000 Costco workers threatened to go on strike, following contentious negotiations with the Teamsters, which accused the company of attempting to become “profit-hungry wholesalers.” The dispute was resolved two months later, with the Teamsters members overwhelmingly ratifying the first national contract at Costco. The firm agreed to significant wage improvements, an increase in pension contributions, and higher semi-annual bonuses with a more flexible attendance policy.“Costco didn’t go to war with the Teamsters. They were able to come back and agree to a better offer than what they initially wanted to get,” said Brucher. “They’re still an employer, they still have different interests. But they were able to negotiate something, and that is being very different than what Amazon or Target have done in the past.”Editor's note: According to Costco, this data from Glassdoor is limited and selective and varies from the company's own internal data.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned +8.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +8.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has gained 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -6.2%. This estimate has changed +4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.58 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $158.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $605.64 billion and $624.17 billion estimates indicate +5.7% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.7%. EPS of $1.50 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

20,4d25d75d-53b2-3c33-9313-836ac1f0270b,RJF,2022-12-06,Raymond James Financial's (NYSE:RJF) investors will be pleased with their strong 116% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-financials-nyse-rjf-145547528.html,1670252147,STORY,"['RJF', 'RJF-PB']","[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE:RJF) shareholders have enjoyed a 100% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 47% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 26% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Raymond James Financial managed to grow its earnings per share at 19% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Raymond James Financial's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Raymond James Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Raymond James Financial the TSR over the last 5 years was 116%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Raymond James Financial shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 26% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Raymond James Financial that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The betting sector was hit hard by the pandemic and the prolonged coronavirus lockdowns in China but has started on the road to recovery in the past few months as Macau reopens and online betting trends, with the advent of world sporting events like the NFL, the UEFA Champions League, the NBA, and the FIFA World Cup, continue to grow at a rapid pace. The global betting market is expected to grow to $8 billion in revenue over the next few years.  Overall, the market size for the industry will hit $200 billion within this decade, growing at a scary compound annual growth rate of around 9% from 2022 onwards. The legalization of sports betting in countries like the US, where betting firms offer services in fifty states, is expected to have a huge impact on the global betting market. The US typically accounts for more than 40% of total gambling revenue worldwide, mostly as a result of activities concentrated in the betting hub of Las Vegas. Some of the top firms operating in the betting sector include Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS). Generally, bets allow people to put money on the line keeping in sight the outcome of an event. For example, the desired outcome results in the one who placed the bet getting paid in an enhanced manner, while if the desired outcome is not achieved, the money on the line is lost in the wager. Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the betting industry. The details of each betting company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. Story continuesPixabay/Public DomainBiggest Betting Companies In The World16. 888 HoldingMarket Capitalization: $500 Million888 Holding is one of the most popular betting companies.

(NYSE:LVS), Better Collective is one of the biggest betting companies in the world. 14. TabcorpMarket Capitalization: $1 BillionTabcorp was founded in 1994 in Melbourne and is the largest betting company of Australia. It provides a diversity of operations in various sectors like sports gambling, casinos gaming, lotteries, keno and media on a secure platform. The firm is exploring different digital avenues to maximize earnings. The revenue of this company is in excess of $3.15 billion. 13. Bet365Market Capitalization: $1 BillionBet365 is a United-Kingdom based betting firm founded in 2000. It is one of the few betting firms with a female executive, namely Denise Coates. The revenue of the firm is more than $3.13 billion and the company is closely associated with the British royal family as well. 12. Kindred GroupMarket Capitalization: $2 BillionKindred Group was founded in Malta in 1997 and is one of the largest betting groups consisting of 9 brands including Unibet, Maria, Casino and 32red. It offers products like online casino, game betting, online poker and online bingo. The betting platforms of the firm serve over 2000 people of 60+ nationalities. It earns more than $800 million in revenue per year. 11. Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN)Market Capitalization: $5 BillionPenn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) provides integrated entertainment, sports content, and casino gaming experiences. Penn’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company has a healthy regional casino business and a strong balance sheet to fund its digital losses. Founded in 1972, in Pennsylvania, USA, it is one of the largest property holders, with about 43 betting properties in the USA and Canada. It has an annual revenue that exceeds  $3.1 billion. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm HG Vora Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) with 7.5 million shares worth more than $206 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 28.3% in the quarter and penalized performance by 71 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in growth. The company has seen no material change to its visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. Penn is generating strong cash flow to more than offset investments in its digital growth opportunity. It is using excess cash to buy back its stock. Penn is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession and, if one does occur, the company should still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels.Management continues to use its excess cash for share repurchases and debt reduction as well as continuing investments in its digital businesses. We think the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business is modest in relation to Penn’s $1 billion of casino EBITDA. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as Penn builds its customer base.""10. Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNW)Market Capitalization: $6 BillionLight &amp; Wonder, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNW), formerly known as Scientific Games, is an online gaming platform from Nevada, USA. It provides instant lottery games, lottery gaming systems, terminals and services, internet applications, server based interactive gaming machines and game control systems.

Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD)    Market Capitalization: $6 BillionBoyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), together with its subsidiaries, operates as a multi-jurisdictional gaming company. It was founded in 1975. It also provides online gambling and gaming opportunities and owns over 25 casinos in the country. In 2018, Boyd Gaming started a partnership with MGM Resorts.

Here is what the fund said:“Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) is one of the largest and most successful casino entertainment companies in the U.S. The company owns and operates 28 casino gaming properties in 10 states with a large presence in Las Vegas. Business conditions have been strong, yet the shares are valued at only 6 times 2022 estimated cash flow versus a long-term average of more than 9 times cash flow. The company maintains a strong and liquid balance sheet. Insiders own approximately 27% of the company. We believe Boyd is a compelling acquisition target.”8. DraftKings Inc.

The firm allows the people to participate in daily fantasy sports (DFS), online casino and sports-related contests.

(NASDAQ:DKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) fell in the quarter, as stocks of online gaming companies were under pressure. Sports betting and i-gaming are rolling out with great fanfare and success across the country; however, investors seem concerned about competition and margins. Most participants are spending heavily on marketing and promotions, which is cutting into margins. We see this as worthy investment in customer acquisition at a moment in time when revenues are just building. We continue to believe that online sports betting and gaming will be enormous industries, that DraftKings will be a leading player. We think the business will have high margins as it matures. We believe we are underwriting the business conservatively and see much upside in the long term.”7.

Here is what the fund said:“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)  due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Betting Companies In The World. Suggested Articles:25 Countries with Highest Life Expectancy23 Countries with Highest Quality of Life in 202213 Best Biotech Penny Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Those trends include:Shifting customer behaviors amplify uncertaintyBurdensome cross-functional collaboration yields worse organizational outcomesDisruptive market dynamics erode traditional sources of brand value""As CMOs enter 2023, the current environment demands a relentless focus on customer value, purposeful evolution of the marketing function, and continual optimization of brand value,"" said Ewan McIntyre, chief of research in the Gartner Marketing practice. ""In order to meet the enterprise mandate of driving growth amid continued disruption, CMOs must act decisively to prioritize their investments and their strategy for the year ahead.""Trend 1: Shifting customer behaviors amplify uncertaintyAmid inflation and economic uncertainty, customer demand and buying behaviors will fluctuate unpredictably. Inflation is driving cost-cutting behaviors, with 30% of consumers buying more store brands, and almost a fifth reducing in-person shopping visits in favor of digital buying, according to a Gartner survey of more than 1,500 consumers in September 2022. This will challenge established brands to maintain brand preference, premiums and loyalty.In addition, the majority of consumers and B2B buyers will increasingly withhold the personal data necessary to effectively track demand or respond with multichannel engagement, exacerbating CMOs’ data challenges. Evolving regulatory and technical safeguards of consumer data privacy, including browser cookie deprecation and new privacy features in iOS and Android, are also making proven digital marketing tactics obsolete.""Marketing leaders should create a digital customer value exchange to provide mutual value on digital channels throughout the full cross-channel journey,"" McIntyre said. ""Enhance the effectiveness of digital marketing by seeking opportunities for personalized engagements that genuinely help customers throughout their end-to-end customer journeys.""Story continuesTrend 2: Cross-functional collaboration yields worse outcomesStrategic marketing priorities, such as innovation, customer experience (CX), and digital commerce, have transcended functional boundaries and are now enterprise-wide priorities with complex cross-functional execution. Shared priorities may draw funding away from marketing departments that have yet to see their budgets return to pre-pandemic levels and taxes already-strained marketing teams, resulting in lower performance against critical marketing goals.A March 2022 Gartner survey of 405 senior marketing leaders found that those who describe their approach as ""independent"" outperform self-described ""collaborators"" on annual revenue targets by almost a quarter. While marketing leaders believe they should take a collaborative approach in theory, those who do in practice are less likely to exceed their customer acquisition goals.""CMOs must adapt team structures and skills to advance new cross-functional operating models. Streamline operations, establish common key performance indicators (KPIs), and orchestrate messaging throughout the customer experience for greater effectiveness of marketing, sales, and other customer-facing teams,"" McIntyre said.Trend 3: Disruptive market dynamics erode traditional sources of brand valueTraditional sources of brand value, such as brand reach, positive brand sentiment, or perceived differentiation are under pressure amid new forces: disruptive market entrants, heightened audience expectations, and the ease of digital learning about unfamiliar brands. Audiences face disruption at each stage along the traditional linear path to brand value:Awareness: Disruptive market entrants require established brands to reposition themselves to remain competitive, challenging all brands to build and maintain awareness through emerging channels and innovative strategies.Consideration: Over half the 1,999 employees, consumers and B2B buyers that Gartner surveyed in June and July 2022 said it’s less important to choose a well-known brand today than it was 3 years ago.Brand Loyalty: The same survey revealed 75% of audiences have searched online for information about a previously unfamiliar brand while shopping, and only 15% of audiences report being committed to a given familiar brand, eroding the value of having a strong brand at the point of decision.""CMOs must redefine and quickly demonstrate the value of brand investments in a volatile environment,"" McIntyre said. ""The strongest driver of brand commitment is a single meaningful brand experience, even with unfamiliar brands.""Gartner clients can read more in ""Leadership Vision for 2023: Chief Marketing Officer.""

Online giant Alibaba has partnered with STC Group for cloud services in Saudi Arabia.Chinese firms are looking at construction in Saudi mega projects like the $500 billion NEOM zone, and opportunities in mining and manufacturing as the kingdom moves to build local content, including in nascent defence and automotive industries.BALANCING ACTHow Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states handle both Chinese and Western supply chains in sensitive areas like critical national infrastructure is likely to remain a point of friction with key security partner the United States, analysts say.""Managing these digital divides, dividends, decouplings, and disaggregations is central to economic progress in Saudi Arabia, GCC and the broader Middle East and North Africa,"" said Adel Hamaizia, managing director at Highbridge Advisory.Gulf Arab officials have said that while Washington remains a key strategic partner, it is important for the region's national economic and security interests to deepen ties with other partners, which have included both China and Russia.""Our trade relations increasingly look to the East, while our primary security and investment relations are in the West,"" senior UAE official Anwar Gargash said last month.GCC-China trade has doubled between 2010 and 2021, London-based think tank Asia House said in a report. However, discussions on a free trade deal have dragged since 2004 and sources say talk of an agreement in the near future appears premature.Beijing's primary motivation for greater cooperation with the Gulf remains embedded in its dependence on energy imports while Arab producers are still heavily reliant on hydrocarbon revenues to deliver on their diversification drive.Russia, a member of the OPEC+ oil producer alliance alongside Saudi Arabia, has been increasing its sales volumes to China with discounted oil after facing Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".""All of the region's oil exporters will want more information on China's plans for lifting COVID restrictions, especially those like Iraq and Oman who are so dependent on that market,"" said Karen Young, senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.(Additional reporting by Yousef Saba; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Nick Macfie)]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Imperial Petroleum (NASDAQ:IMPP) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Imperial Petroleum, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.048 = US$15m ÷ (US$322m - US$19m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Imperial Petroleum has an ROCE of 4.8%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Oil and Gas industry average of 21%. See our latest analysis for Imperial Petroleum roceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Imperial Petroleum's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you're interested in investigating Imperial Petroleum's past further, check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.How Are Returns Trending?We're delighted to see that Imperial Petroleum is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making two years ago but is is now generating 4.8% on its capital. In addition to that, Imperial Petroleum is employing 122% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.Story continuesThe Bottom LineOverall, Imperial Petroleum gets a big tick from us thanks in most part to the fact that it is now profitable and is reinvesting in its business. Although the company may be facing some issues elsewhere since the stock has plunged 95% in the last year. Still, it's worth doing some further research to see if the trends will continue into the future.If you want to know some of the risks facing Imperial Petroleum we've found 2 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy as well as labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Southern Copper Corp. and First Quantum Minerals. These are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process.Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit followed by assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly precede actual mining. The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of an Economic Slowdown Weighing on Commodity Prices: Copper prices have declined for most part of this year due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession.Story continuesSilver prices have also been negatively impacted this year, thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Gold prices also felt the pressure of a rallying dollar and Treasury yields. However, recently, metal prices have found support amid expectations of a pickup in industrial demand as Fed Chair Powell signaled that the central bank may slow the pace of rate hikes this month. Concerns of low supply are also aiding prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues.Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternative energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance: The industry players are currently dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future given their wide usage in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials.Demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy are expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals. While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 19% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of this year, the industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 38%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 7.1% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector growth of 1.8%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 12.8% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 4.95X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.03X.

Shell, BP and TotalEnergies were each down around 1%, and were among the biggest drags on the pan-European index.Having hit an an over three-month high last Thursday, MSCI's world index is now entering what was shaping up to be a third straight session of decline.Data released on Monday showed U.S. services industry activity unexpectedly picked up in November following a robust U.S. payrolls report published Friday - all of which raised doubts over whether the Fed would go for smaller hikes in interest rates just yet.""A reassuring trend was in place - policy tightening, leading to growth slowdown leading to slower inflation - which allowed this correction in risk assets and the dollar,"" said Samy Chaar chief economist at Lombard Odier.""Then we had two important bits of data that went the other way, a good job report, non manufacturing ISN, which if not calling that trend into question, do show there will be bumps in the road.""Aggressive U.S. rate increases earlier in the year had caused stocks to tumble and U.S. treasury yields and the dollar to soar.The dollar, on Tuesday, held firm against most peers.

(NYSE:CRM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.16bUS$7.39bUS$8.83bUS$10.9bUS$12.8bUS$14.2bUS$15.4bUS$16.4bUS$17.3bUS$18.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x25Analyst x28Analyst x19Analyst x7Analyst x4Est @ 11.1%Est @ 8.37%Est @ 6.45%Est @ 5.11%Est @ 4.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$5.7kUS$6.4kUS$7.1kUS$8.2kUS$9.0kUS$9.3kUS$9.4kUS$9.3kUS$9.1kUS$8.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$83bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$343bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$343b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$169bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$251b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$134, the company appears quite good value at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.044. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Still trading 13% off its 52-week highs LULU’s current fiscal year earnings estimates are on the rise.This year’s earnings are now expected to climb 27% to $9.89 per share, up slightly from 90 days ago.Sales are projected to jump 27% in FY23 and leap another 14% in FY24 to $9.03 billion. Fiscal 2024 would represent an impressive 175% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $3.28 billion. This reflects the brand’s popularity and expansion both domestically and internationally as online and brick-and-mortar sales are both growing.Lululemon stock is only down -2% YTD Vs. the S&amp;P 500’s -16% and the Textile-Apparel Manufacturing Markets -24%. LULU is up +425% over the last decade to beat the benchmark and its Zacks Subindustry’s +40%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLululemon’s resilient YTD performance and stellar ascension over the last decade are reasons to consider the stock in FY23 and beyond.LULU trades at 39X forward earnings. This is above the industry average of 10.6X but Wall Street has been ok with paying a premium for Lululemon shares as its growth has been nearly exponential. Plus, Lulu trades at a 56% discount to its decade-high of 90.3X and is closer to the median of 33.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRalph Lauren RL Another premium apparel company investors might want to consider going into FY23 is Ralph Lauren (RL). Ralph Lauren is also part of the Textile-Apparel Industry. While the industry is currently in the bottom 31% of all Zacks Industries Ralph Lauren has been a historical leader in the space.Story continuesRalph Lauren shares currently trade 18% from their highs at around $111 per share. RL stock has also rallied nicely off its September lows of $82.33 a share.Ralph Lauren stock is down -6% YTD, which is above the benchmark and the Textile-Apparel Manufacturing Market. Over the last decade, RL is down -28% to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s +189% and its Zacks Subindustry’s +40%.However, over the last 20 years, we can see from the nearby chart that RL is still up +410% to beat the broader market and its Zacks Subindustry’s +365%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRalph Lauren is adjusting to current times to compete with younger companies such as Lululemon. There should be room for both apparel giants to succeed and grow.Ralph Lauren’s Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to decline -7% but rebound and jump 12% in FY24 to $8.66 per share. It should be noted that earnings estimates have trended lower for FY23 and FY24.Sales are forecasted to be virtually flat in FY23 and rise 5% in FY24 to $6.55 billion. Ralph Lauren's FY24 sales are projected to grow 4% from pre-pandemic levels of $6.31 billion in FY19.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Polo brand company is in a different stage of corporate life and growth than Lululemon and its valuation looks attractive. Shares of Ralph Lauren currently trade at 14.9X forward earnings. This is slightly above the industry average of 10.6X. With that being said, Ralph Lauren trades well below its decade-high of 242.3X and beneath the median of 17.6X.Ralph Lauren’s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Although earnings estimates have trended down, the stock still trades attractively relative to its past. RL also offers patient investors a solid 2.60% annual dividend yield at $3.00 a share.Bottom LineProgressing through the holiday season, these companies will be on shoppers’ buy lists and should be on investors’ watch lists as well. Both Lululemon and Ralph Lauren stocks appear to be trading at discounts and are worthy of investors’ consideration as we close out the year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UNH's Government business remains well-poised for growth.

The company has been resorting to prudent capital deployment moves. For 2022, Cigna expects adjusted income from operations to be at least $22.90 per share.However, high leverage can affect its financial flexibility.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, News (NASDAQ:NWSA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for News:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.069 = US$923m ÷ (US$16b - US$3.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, News has an ROCE of 6.9%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.5% average generated by the Media industry. View our latest analysis for News roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for News compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering News here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?News' ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 56% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.In Conclusion...To sum it up, News is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 23% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.Story continuesNews does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for News  that you might be interested in.While News isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy.2022 has been the year for energy stocks. While all sectors of the economy fluctuated, the energy sector remained relatively robust, as energy stocks have been enjoying higher oil prices. Oil prices have soared in 2022, primarily due to the Ukraine war. However, oil prices recently started to tumble, and this trend was met by OPEC Plus voting for a production cut of 2 million barrels a day in early October. It was speculated that another production cut might be on the way. However, on December 4, The Washing Post reported that OPEC Plus voted against cutting oil production and agreed on keeping production steady.On November 29, the portfolio manager of the Hennessy Midstream Fund and the Hennessy Transition Fund, Ben Cook, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where he discussed the energy market, energy stocks, and commodities among other factors that are expected to drive outperformance in the energy sector. According to Ben Cook, the energy sector's outperformance can be sustained since energy companies ""have redirected a significant amount of cash flow back to paying down debt, returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases"" therefore improving their financial health. Here are some comments from Ben Cook about why he is bullish on energy and sees continued outperformance:""Historically, there has been a close correlation between the commodity, if you look at the twelve-month future strip, and the equities, they have tracked fairly closely. And again, we have seen that divergence occur because I think the market is acknowledging, again, the financial conditions of these companies that have improved dramatically. And over time, as we see continued strength in commodity fundamentals, we expect that divergence to actually resolve to the upside with commodity prices moving higher, and we think the equities will continue to enjoy the benefits of that strong commodity environment. This is not just for oils, this is for natural gas as well...""Story continuesBen Cook also shared his thoughts about OPEC policy and what his base case is for crude oil prices in 2023. Here are some comments from the analyst:""OPEC is wrestling with a variety of issues right now obviously, the weakness in China, associated with the zero-Covid lockdown policy. They are dealing with a global monetary system that is tightening post-pandemic. We continue to believe that OPEC will be very supportive of crude prices, they would like to see oil prices higher than where we are right now. Our base case is that we see a range of crude oil prices between $80 and $100 into 2023, and again, that should support very strong operational and financial results for the companies in our investable universe...""Some of the top-performing energy stocks in 2022 have been Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and they are well-positioned to sustain this outperformance into 2023 and beyond. This article will discuss these stocks, among others, so investors can rack up shares of these companies while they are still trading at attractive valuations.Our MethodologyTo determine the best undervalued energy stocks to buy now, we screened for leading energy companies that have healthy balance sheets and abundant cash resources.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

Voting will go on for a month.So far, Microsoft has remained neutral toward the union and the company is “providing clear guidance to managers on neutrality,” Code-CWA tweeted Monday (Dec. 5). The Zenimax union-in-the-making, which represents workers from several studios, including The Elder Scrolls and Fallout maker Bethesda‚ said the same.If the vote passes, it’ll be a landmark win for more than one reason: It would create the largest video game industry union in the US, and the first official US union under Microsoft.Microsoft did not respond to Quartz’s request for comment at the time of publishing. Overall, Activision has about 7,000 employees in the country, most of whom are eligible to unionize.Why video game workers want to unionize, by the digitsZenimax’s laundry list of what it wants to negotiate—fair wages, opportunities for advancement, accountability and transparency, as well as a voice in decision making around scheduling, workload and more—is not an anomaly. The International Game Developers Association’s 2021 Developer Satisfaction Survey reveal a similar set of complaints, from grueling working conditions to stunted career growth to discrimination, plague the video game workforce on the whole:35%: Employees who worked “crunch” periods, where people are made to work longer shifts on weekdays and several hours on the weekends, sometimes for weeks in a row, and without pay that makes up for it. (Legally, computer professionals who earn cross an annual salary threshold—it varies from state to state—are considered exempt from overtime laws.)Story continues32%: Employees who worked “longer hours” but just didn’t call it crunch58%: Share of those among employees who “crunched” who’d done it more than twice in the previous year32%: Employees who did not receive extra compensation for crunch or overtime47%: Those who thought crunch was normal or a part of the job29%: Employees who thought career advancement chances were “fair” or “poor”56%: Respondents who perceived inequity towards themselves71%: Respondents who perceived inequity towards others based on gender, age, ethnicity, ability, or sexual orientation.Microsoft’s “neutrality” towards unions and its Activision Blizzard dealTypically, tech giants try to quash unions. E-commerce behemoth Amazon keeps intimidating voters against organizing, and it won’t stop pushing back even on a successful union vote. When it comes to union-busting, Apple has been accused of leveraging illegal tactics.On the contrary, Microsoft is playing nice. But it’s not entirely altruistic. It’s likely a bid to convince the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to greenlight its nearly $70 billion purchase of embattled video game firm Activision Blizzard.At the start of June, XBox boss Phil Spencer recognized the union vote by two dozen employees at Call of Duty’s Raven Software—the first union at a major video game studio.The same month, Microsoft entered a “labor neutrality agreement” with CWA, vowing to not deter union efforts at Activision. The agreement will go into effect 60 days after the acquisition (if it does).Currying favor from a politically powerful union that was among the vocal critics of the Microsoft-Activision deal has yielded some benefits, as the CWA now advocates in favor of the acquisition. Its president, Chris Shelton, met with the FTC chairperson to urge regulators not to block the deal.Looking out for workers in the Microsoft-Activision dealBefore the neutrality agreement:“Before any approval of this proposed deal, the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and states Attorneys General must all carefully consider the impacts on consumers and American workers, especially Activision Blizzard employees who have been trying to improve working conditions and raising up troubling issues regarding company culture of sexist and discriminatory cultural practices, pay inequity, workplace harassment, and abuse.” —CWA president Christopher M. Shelton on Jan. 18, 2022After the neutrality agreement:“Our neutrality agreement with Microsoft is different from other behavioral remedies which have often been tossed aside by companies as soon as the ink was dry on their deals. This is a structural solution, creating a pathway for workers to organize and exercise their true bargaining strength, altering power relations in the labor context but also potentially empowering thousands of consumer-minded watchdogs inside the company. And it’s enforceable through a legally binding agreement.” —Shelton in a May. 12 op-ed for The Hill, urging the FTC to clear the merger.Another day, another unionOn Dec. 2, Activision workers in Albany voted 14-0 in favor of unionizing with CWA, adding another union to Microsoft’s roster should the deal go through.Related stories⚔️ Microsoft is ready for its biggest antitrust battle in decades after Activision deal🌐 Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard gives it the clear lead in the metaverse🎮 The US video game industry gets its first major unionMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) the past four times to a range of 3.75% to 4%. Experts anticipate a further 50 bps hike when the Federal Reserve meets in December. Federal Reserve officials anticipate that the benchmark interest rate will peak around the 4.6% level over the next year. Meanwhile, some hawkish members of the Federal Reserve anticipate the interest rate to peak at around the 7% mark. Experts also believe that earnings could fall by 8% next year due to macroeconomic uncertainty.Amidst the bearish market momentum, it can be difficult to make investments in stocks with strong upside potential. Many analysts think that the quality of a stock can be gauged by its intrinsic value, returns, and earnings quality. However, there is no consensus on one particular basis to gauge quality. Some experts believe that price multiples like price-to-book (P/B) value, price-to-cash flow (P/CF), price-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (P/EBITDA), and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are sound measures to determine the quality of a stock. Furthermore, low volatility in the bottom line, high asset turnover and margins, low level of debt, and low-risk profile can also be considered indicators of high-quality stocks. In line with these metrics, companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are considered some of the best quality stocks in the market currently.11 Best Quality Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyStory continuesWe have shortlisted the 11 best quality stocks based on their business fundamentals and earnings quality.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Maryland-based aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with a global presence.The maker of the F-35 fighter has emerged as the biggest contract recipient with the US Department of Defense. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) received $39.2 billion worth of contracts from the Pentagon over the last year. Following the better-than-expected Q3 2022 results and an expanded share buyback plan, Peter J. Arment at Baird upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock from a Neutral to an Outperform rating while maintaining a target price of $513 on October 19.The analyst believes that the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows is still in place, and the strong buyback plan in a volatile market limits the downside potential of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Furthermore, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is expected to be a beneficiary of a ramped-up global defense expenditure at a time when tensions between global powers are high. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.48% as of December 5.Vltava Fund discussed its outlook on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company with a global footprint. The company claims that over 1.9 billion servings of its beverages are consumed across more than 200 countries every day.In a research note issued on October 26, Peter Grom at UBS maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and increased the price target from $63 to $68. The analyst termed the Q3 2022 results as strong and the increase in financial guidance as impressive. This was due to organic growth that was able to offset the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. The analyst believes that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) can trade at a premium against its peers due to the possibility of strong revenue growth in the upcoming quarters. This makes the risk and reward profile of the stock favorable for potential investors. Experts believe that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a price leadership position in the market and an advanced top-line growth management strategy that is expected to provide impetus to the top line. The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) annual dividend yield stands at 2.74% as of December 5.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, shared its stance on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the third biggest retailer in the world. The Issaquah, Washington-based company operates as a membership-only big box retailer with large warehouses.Analysts at Bank of America added Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock to the 'US 1 List' on November 22. The 'US 1 List' comprises the best investment ideas across all the sectors that are covered by the analysts at Bank of America. Experts believe that retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) will perform strongly through their low-priced private label brands as the consumer is trading down and buying fewer items. The holiday season is expected to provide a boost to the company due to higher consumer spending. Given the raging inflation, people will be looking for value, and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) falls under that category. Furthermore, the company’s membership program is also going strong as the annual renewal rate sits around the 90% mark. The stock's annual payout stands at $3.60, translating into a dividend yield of 0.68% as of December 5.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a Beaverton, Oregon-based company known for its footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment with a sports-based theme.

(NYSE:NKE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”NIKE, Inc.

Cash and cash equivalents were $327.3 million as of quarter end, compared to $1.5 billion last year. The year over year change to cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by share repurchases and inventory in-stock replenishment, and the acquisitions of Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile.Ending inventory was $2.4 billion, up approximately $281 million to the third quarter last year as a result of the Company's acquisitions of Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile, which was partially offset by lower inventory levels in the rest of the Company.Return of Capital:Signet's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on common shares of $0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, payable February 24, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 27, 2023, with an ex-dividend date of January 26, 2023.Fiscal 2023 year to date, through December 2, Signet has repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares at an average cost per share of $70.28, or $393.0 million, including $20.2 million during the third quarter and $50 million from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program from Fiscal 2022. Approximately $570.3 million remains under the Company's multi-year authorization.Our Purpose and Sustainable Growth:As a company with a Purpose-inspired business strategy, Signet is committed to ongoing leadership in Corporate Citizenship &amp; Sustainability and views Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") initiatives as an important growth driver.

The ""Signet Promise"" is Signet's public commitment to continuously improve the integrity of our global diamond supply chain though our four-layered system of checks and balances to support consumer confidence.Fiscal 2023 Guidance:Signet is providing below its fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2023 sales and operating income guidance which is provided on a non-GAAP basis.Fourth QuarterFiscal 2023Total sales (in billions)$2.59 to $2.66$7.77 to $7.84Operating income (1) (in millions)$363 to $404$809 to $850Diluted EPS (1)$11.40 to $12.00(1)See description of non-GAAP measures below.Forecasted non-GAAP operating income provided above excludes potential non-recurring charges, such as integration-related costs associated with the acquisition of Blue Nile and the potential impacts of purchase accounting.  However, given the potential impacts of these items to the GAAP operating income, we cannot provide forecasted GAAP operating income or the probable significance of such items without unreasonable efforts. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP operating income to corresponding GAAP operating income.The Company's fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2023 Outlook is based on the following assumptions:The Company's outlook includes a level of consumer pressure, including inflation and the impact of stimulus, similar to what is currently being experienced. The Company's outlook does not include a material worsening of macroeconomic factors which could impact consumer spending patterns and have associated impacts on business performance.The Company's outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of Fiscal 2023 includes the impact of the Blue Nile acquisition and continuing unfavorable revenue impact from foreign currency.Signet continues to anticipate some shift of consumer discretionary spending away from the jewelry category reflecting pent-up demand for experience-oriented categories.Signet's efforts to mitigate supply chain disruption have been effective thus far. Guidance assumes no significant disruptions in availability of inventory.The Company's outlook factors in some flexibility in the level of promotion during the 4th Quarter of Fiscal 2023.Annual effective tax rate of approximately 17% assumes no additional discrete items and no changes in current tax laws during the remainder of Fiscal 2023.The above guidance excludes non-recurring charges for Fiscal 2023 related to the resolution of a previously disclosed legal matter of $190 million, approximately $17 million relating to the fair value adjustment of acquired inventory that will be recognized within cost of sales in Fiscal 2023, and the non-cash, non-operating charges for the buy-out of substantially all of the UK pension obligations of approximately $135 million.Earnings per share includes share repurchases through December 2, 2022, as well as the dilutive effect of the 8.1 million preferred shares.Capital investments up to $215 million, reflecting continued investments in Connected Commerce capabilities, banner differentiation and technology harmonization. The expected capital investments have been reduced as a result of supply chain delays related to differentiated banner investment in stores.Conference Call:A conference call is scheduled for December 6, 2022 at 8:30 a.m. ET and a simultaneous audio webcast is available at www.signetjewelers.com.

The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating historical trends and current period performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting also includes non-GAAP measures. Items may be excluded from GAAP financial measures when the Company believes this provides useful supplementary information to management and investors in assessing the operating performance of our business.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.In discussing financial results, the Company refers to free cash flow that is not in accordance with GAAP and is defined as the net cash (used in) provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Management considers adjusted free cash flow, defined as free cash flow excluding proceeds from the sale of the non-prime in-house finance receivables, as helpful in understanding how the business is generating cash from its operating and investing activities that can be used to meet the financing needs of the business. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are indicators used by management frequently in evaluating its overall liquidity and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies.

In the ever-evolving and often strange world of investing, investors who seek value plays can follow the Roundhill Acquirers Deep Value ETF, which offers retail and institutional investors exposure to largely undervalued stocks, and seeks investment results that closely track the performance of the Acquirers Deep Value Index. The fund has $42 million in assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.80%. The Roundhill Acquirers Deep Value ETF was launched on September 23, 2014. David Einhorn, the portfolio manager of Greenlight Capital, said in the beginning of October 2022 that value investing might never be mainstream again. He noted that there are very few market participants who are actually well versed in value investing, and most investors have turned to passive and quantitative investing. He said that “nobody knows what anything is worth” and explaining his stance further, Einhorn told Bloomberg: “So there’s an enormous number of companies that are dramatically mis-valued in ways that we haven’t seen before.”On the other hand, Aaron Dunn and Brad Galko, Co-Heads of the Value team at Eaton Vance, part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, stated on June 17 that financial services, healthcare, and industrials may provide lucrative investment opportunities in the current market backdrop. They noted that companies manufacturing medical technology and pharmaceuticals are also attractive value-investing plays. Some of the best value stocks include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

79,5fd446a6-4b54-40b1-8cb1-a2f3a85cc47d,SBUX,2022-12-06,How Costco keeps the peace with its employees,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-costco-keeps-the-peace-with-its-employees-124516498.html,1670330716,STORY,"['COST', 'WMT', 'AMZN', 'SBUX']","[Steady membership fees and cost savings helped fuel Costco (COST) to record membership renewal rates this year, driven in part by concerns about inflation.But the Issaquah, Washington–based company has quietly emerged as a leader on another critical issue that dominated the retail sector in 2022 — labor relations and the employee push to unionize.Rival retailers, meanwhile. have struggled to address employee demands for higher wages and better benefits while fending off efforts to organize. But Costco, Yahoo Finance's 2022 Company of the Year, has managed to separate itself from the pack, building on a reputation as one of the friendliest places to work in retail.According to data from Glassdoor, Costco employees rated the company a 4 out of 5, putting it well ahead of competitors like Sam’s Club and Target (TGT). Longtime CEO Craig Jelinek earned an approval rating of 85% from its staff, surpassing Amazon’s (AMZN) Andy Jassy and Walmart's (WMT) Doug McMillon.“They’ve set a higher entry-level wage, more full-time jobs, more access to employee benefits, and generally, probably better working conditions as well,” said William Brucher, an assistant teaching professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. “A lot of that has to do with Costco’s business model, in that it makes most of its profit on memberships.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.That base annual $60 membership fee has taken the pressure off of Costco to be a “low-road employer” according to Brucher, who said the discount retailer has consistently outpaced competitors when it comes to the number of full-time employees it hires. Costco cashiers earn, on average, $32,000 a year. While just one-fifth of hourly workers at Costco are unionized, they earn largely the same pay as their non-unionized workforce.In addition, employees who work for 180 consecutive days for more than 23 hours a week qualify for Costco’s health benefits plan, which includes medical care along with coverage for dental and vision with low co-pays, according to Glassdoor.Story continues“This is aimed at discouraging unionization in the nonunion warehouses, and so far that aim has been met,” said Professor Ruth Milkman, Labor Studies Chair for CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies. “Turnover is lower (typical whenever pay is higher) than in companies like Walmart; productivity is also higher - and probably morale. So Costco has developed a totally viable business model, and obviously one that is superior for the hourly employees.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.That stands in stark contrast to discontent brewing within hourly employees at chains like Starbucks (SBUX) and Amazon. For instance, warehouse workers at Amazon's Staten Island, New York, facility helped organize the company’s first-ever U.S. labor union this spring, but workers say the company has so far refused to come to the bargaining table or recognize the group as the Amazon Labor Union. While more than 300 Starbucks stores in roughly three dozen states have held union elections, the coffee chain has consistently pushed back against employee efforts, sending anti-union messaging to employees and isolating workers by announcing raises and benefits for nonunion employees.Costco has historically been more amenable to labor groups, in part out of necessity. When Costco merged with then rival Price Club in 1993, the firm inherited a handful of stores already unionized for the Teamsters.“We always want to make sure that our employees are at the higher end of the scale and we believe that they are at the top end,” said Jelinek in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “Of course, that starting wage is narrowed for everybody. But we wanna also pay for longevity. We do not want to turn people. We want to keep our employees.”But the tight labor market is starting to chip away at Costco’s leadership, as rival retailers raise their own wages and compensation to secure workers. Amazon, Walmart, and Sam’s Club now offer higher wages than Costco for cashiers and sales associates, putting pressure on the firm.Clackamas, OR, USA - Jun 8, 2021: The entrance to the Costco Wholesale Store in Clackamas, Oregon.This summer, roughly 18,000 Costco workers threatened to go on strike, following contentious negotiations with the Teamsters, which accused the company of attempting to become “profit-hungry wholesalers.” The dispute was resolved two months later, with the Teamsters members overwhelmingly ratifying the first national contract at Costco. The firm agreed to significant wage improvements, an increase in pension contributions, and higher semi-annual bonuses with a more flexible attendance policy.“Costco didn’t go to war with the Teamsters. They were able to come back and agree to a better offer than what they initially wanted to get,” said Brucher. “They’re still an employer, they still have different interests. But they were able to negotiate something, and that is being very different than what Amazon or Target have done in the past.”Editor's note: According to Costco, this data from Glassdoor is limited and selective and varies from the company's own internal data.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

80,d43bcec4-e703-34d4-8506-4e4f3a59be20,SBUX,2022-12-06,Starbucks has rolled out a new tipping system and customers are freaking out,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-rolled-tipping-system-customers-224125535.html,1670280085,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Tipping at restaurants and coffee shops can be tricky business. Technically, it isn’t mandatory, but it’s increasingly looked down upon if you skip it altogether. That’s exactly the pickle customers are finding themselves in with the new tipping system at [hotlink]Starbucks[/hotlink].The world-famous coffee chain announced the initiative in May as a way for customers to “recognize their favorite baristas.” They began rolling it out in some stores in September, where customers paying with debit or credit cards can give the barista a $1, $2 or custom tip—prompting some strong feelings in the process.A Reddit thread about the tipping system has racked up more than 100 comments.“It works so well for in-store purchases but yeah having it in drive thru is so awkward I never know what to say,” one user wrote One [hotlink]Twitter[/hotlink] user wrote: “I went through the Starbucks Drive through and got one drink and they now start asking if you want to tip as soon as you pull your card out to pay while looking at you It’s so awkward…… just pay these people a better wage.”Starting August 1, Starbucks increased the average pay for employees to nearly $17/hour in the U.S. Those hired before May 2 would receive either a 3% wage increase or $15/hour, whichever is higher, a spokesperson at Starbucks said.Another Twitter user wrote: “I’m really not trying to be rude bc I know customer service jobs are hard work but now they want tips at the drive-thru at my Starbucks when you pay with a card… you’re literally just handing it to me.”One [hotlink]Facebook[/hotlink] user wrote: “People WILL call me cheap, but I rarely tip on to-go orders or grabbing a coffee…I do tip very well when I go to dinner, or use various services.I don’t really want to leave a 25% tip on a drive thru coffee order What are your thoughts?”But not everyone dislikes the new system. Several Reddit users said they would gladly tip the baristas. People who identified themselves as former Starbucks workers also said it was a welcome change.Story continuesThe Starbucks Workers Union (SBWU) told Fortune that the credit card tipping program directly resulted from their campaign.“Credit card tipping was one of the first demands that unionizing workers made in Buffalo, NY last fall when we launched our campaign,” a spokesperson from SBWU said. “Only after we began putting pressure on Starbucks did the company announce its plans to implement credit card tipping.""A spokesperson for Starbucks told Fortune that employees at the company had been awaiting a credit card tipping functionality, which adds to the existing wage and benefit system. The company said it has been in talks about a digital tipping system before any union activity began.“The system is similar to what you would see at other retailers and not unique to Starbucks,” the spokesperson said. “We have seen very positive feedback from both customers and partners (employees) when it comes to the tipping.”Starbucks employees have been the center of a unionization campaign in the past year. The movement has spread quickly across the nation, as the company went from no unions last December, to over 250 unionized stores today.Dec. 5, 2022: This story has been updated with additional comment from Starbucks.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

It is fair to say each time a customer gets a free latte with their Starbucks stars or orders a drink on the app, the credit should go to Adam Brotman.Starbucks' then-chief digital officer, Brotman led the design of the mobile order and pay system and built its rewards program, which launched in 2009. Then he left Starbucks in 2018 for a brief stint as president, chief experience officer and co-CEO of retailer J.Crew.Brotman fell down the crypto ""rabbit hole"" in Jan. 2021, when he studied blockchain technology and everything Web3 with venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur Andy Sack. That was when he stumbled on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which he described as a ""terrific, innovative tool for brands.""Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022NFTs “can be a storytelling mechanism because of the metadata you can put in it that can be branded. It can have a rarity curve that gives you all of the surface areas for storytelling and brand building. But because it's collectible there is a digital asset that can also form a sense of identity, you can get community and you can also get utility out of it,"" Brotman told CoinDesk. In Aug. 2021, Brotman and Sack co-founded Forum3, a Web3 loyalty startup to advise retailers.By this time, Starbucks’ founder Howard Schultz, who has come back twice to lead Starbucks, was at the helm again as interim CEO. He was curious about the Web3 loyalty concept and upon discussing with Brotman became convinced it would be a powerful way to innovate on Starbucks’ customer engagement and loyalty.This September, Starbucks officially announced the concept of Starbucks Odyssey, a rewards program allowing customers to purchase and earn digital collectible stamps – aka NFTs – that offer benefits and immersive experiences. The company opened a waiting list to gauge interest. In early November Brotman said he and Starbucks are ""pretty excited about"" the number, but declined to disclose what it was.Story continues""They wanted to have a separate brand but also a brand and a name that would evoke the idea of the romance and fun of going on journeys and collecting stamps in your passport and whatnot. So a lot of the nomenclature for Starbucks Odyssey is built around the game itself and the experience itself, which is an extension of the rewards program,"" Brotman said.Now, Brotman and his team are working closely with Starbucks on the Starbucks Odyssey, which is expected to launch this month. With Starbucks as only Forum3’s third client, Brotman hopes to work with hundreds of brands over the next year. Even though the public's passion for NFTs has cooled, for Brotman the speculative nature of the asset was never his main interest.""I'm just as excited now as I was then [the first time he knew about NFTs] because it was always about the combination of collectability and brand engagement that got me excited. So that excitement hasn't changed at all,"" Brotman said.]"

The airline sector is considered one of the most difficult to decarbonize as fuel for flights cannot be easily replaced with other kinds of power.The biofuel industry got a boost this year from passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides significant subsidies to the biodiesel and sustainable jet fuel industries in the form of tax credits.""We believe there's enough economic incentive for SAF to be profitable and to be a viable blend for jet fuel,"" he said, adding that in some circumstances, ""we believe there is some profitability already in SAF.""Luthar also said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposal of renewable volume obligations is a positive move for the biofuel industry that ""establishes a floor, not a ceiling for demand going forward.""The proposal marks the latest chapter for the more than decade-old Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), under which oil refiners are required to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's fuel mix or buy tradable credits from those that do.""There's an opportunity to convert 900 million gallons of our ethanol into about 500 million gallons of SAF,"" Luthar said, noting that the federal Inflation Reduction Act will likely accelerate and expand investment in the sector.Story continuesRead more:TotalEnergies and Air France KLM agree sustainable jet fuel dealRyanair to buy sustainable fuel from Shell but 2030 target elusive(Reporting by P.J.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap. The semiconductor industry is among the most popular and lucrative sectors in the world. With chips now starting to be heralded as the 'new oil', their ubiquity has ensured that the modern day world can not function without the valuable resource. Whether it is the smartphone in your hand, the computer on your desk, the engine control system in your car, or the large data centers that power your shopping experiences, chips are silently ticking away at the center of nearly every modern day convenience.Therefore, it is not surprising that the semiconductor industry itself has lucrative future estimates. For instance, a research report by Allied Markets Research believes that the industry was already worth $555 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21% to sit at a whopping $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm states that this growth will be driven by the growth in consumer electronics, particularly due to the growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets spurred by the proliferation of fifth generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence are now playing a central role in how major companies operate throughout the globe, and their computational requirements are also expected to spur the demand for advanced semiconductors.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has an even more optimistic growth outlook for the chip sector. It estimates that the industry was worth $528 billion in 2021, and from then until 2029, it will grow at a strong CAGR of 12.2% to be worth $1.3 trillion by as early as 2029. Fortune Business concurs with Allied Markets in the belief that IoT will spur growth, but it goes on to add that China will be the fastest growing region as larger chunks of its population gain smartphone access. The Chinese market already accounted for half of the semiconductor revenue pie in 2021, as it generated $289 billion worth of sales.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take look at the largest semiconductor firms in the world.

93,d5755204-eb3e-3613-895c-146c116bbeca,PM,2022-12-06,Philip Morris International Inc.'s (NYSE:PM) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 75% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-nyse-110205354.html,1670324525,STORY,['PM'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.58bUS$10.1bUS$11.2bUS$11.8bUS$12.3bUS$12.7bUS$13.1bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bUS$14.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$9.0kUS$9.0kUS$9.4kUS$9.3kUS$9.1kUS$8.9kUS$8.6kUS$8.4kUS$8.1kUS$7.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$88bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$349bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$349b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$193bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$281b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$103, the company appears quite good value at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

PM appears well-poised with its strong pricing power and focus on reduced risk products (RRPs) amid rising cost concerns and soft cigarette volumes.For 2022, the company expects proforma adjusted net revenues to increase by nearly 6.5-8% on an organic basis (compared with 6-8% before). The proforma adjusted EPS, excluding currency impacts, is expected to increase 10-12% to the $6.09-$6.20 range in 2022.Let’s delve deeper.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteFactors Backing Philip MorrisSerious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward RRPs. The company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating more than 30% of the company’s net revenues in the third quarter of 2022.Philip Morris is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry.In the United States, the IQOS was launched in 2019 through a commercial deal with Altria. The deal was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.However, on Oct 20, 2022, Philip Morris reached a deal with Altria to cease their commercial association related to IQOS in the United States as of Apr 30, 2024. After this date, PM will have total rights to commercialize IQOS in the United States. For this deal, Philip Morris will pay a total cash consideration of $2.7 billion to Altria.In the third quarter of 2022, revenues from RRPs jumped 12.9% to $2,362 million. In the quarter, the company witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance. IQOS ILUMA continued to generate solid results across launch markets.Management expects solid prospects from IQOS in the future. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company is estimated to have roughly 19.5 million IQOS users on a pro-forma basis, reflecting growth of 22% year over year.Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. This has helped the company stay firm, even amid soft cigarette shipment volumes and times of higher taxes.Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance across most regions in the third quarter of 2022.Story continuesHurdlesCigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In the third quarter of 2022, cigarette shipment volumes dropped 1.7% to around 162 billion units. In 2022, the total international industry volume growth (proforma basis) is estimated between flat and an increase of 1%, excluding China and the United States.PM has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the third quarter of 2022, the proforma adjusted operating income margin fell 1 point on an organic basis. The decline can be attributed to investments related to expanding IQOS ILUMA, the elevated initial cost of ILUMA devices and related heated tobacco units or HTUs, supply-chain constraints (mainly due to the Ukraine war) and global cost inflation.In 2022, the proforma adjusted operating margin growth on an organic basis is likely to come in the range of a decline of 50 basis points (bps) to flat (compared with flat to an increase of 50 bps expected earlier).The gross margin is expected to be lower due to a considerable rise in IQOS device volumes (with supply restrictions easing), the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA, elevated logistic costs, growth-oriented investments in the smoke-free space, raw material and energy cost inflation and incremental supply-chain costs.However, the hurdles are likely to be partially compensated by a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. Pricing power and strength in RRPs are likely to keep Philip Morris on its growth track.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have climbed 10.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 7.9%.Looking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

The contagion has affected such firms as crypto lender BlockFi, which also filed bankruptcy last month.""We do see some really interesting opportunities, priced much more sensibly,"" Mathew McDermott, Goldman's head of digital assets, told Reuters.

""FTX was a poster child in many parts of the ecosystem. But to reiterate, the underlying technology continues to perform.""While the amount Goldman may potentially invest is not large for the Wall Street giant, which earned $21.6 billion last year, its willingness to keep investing amid the sector shakeout shows it senses a long term opportunity.Its CEO David Solomon told CNBC on Nov. 10, as the FTX drama was unfolding, that while he views cryptocurrencies as ""highly speculative"", he sees much potential in the underlying technology as its infrastructure becomes more formalized.Rivals are more sceptical.""I don't think it's a fad or going away, but I can't put an intrinsic value on it,"" Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said at the Reuters NEXT conference on Dec. 1.HSBC CEO Noel Quinn, meanwhile, told a banking conference in London last week he has no plans to expand into crypto trading or investing for retail customers.Story continuesGoldman has invested in 11 digital asset companies that provide services such as compliance, cryptocurrency data and blockchain management.McDermott, who competes in triathlons in his spare time, joined Goldman in 2005 and rose to run its digital assets business after serving as head of cross asset financing.His team has grown to more than 70 people, including a seven-strong crypto options and derivatives trading desk.Goldman Sachs has also together with MSCI and Coin Metrics launched data service datonomy, aimed at classifying digital assets based on how they are used.The firm is also building its own private distributed ledger technology, McDermott said.'TRUSTED' PLAYERSThe global cryptocurrency market peaked at $2.9 trillion in late 2021, according to data site CoinMarketCap, but has shed about $2 trillion this year as central banks tightened credit and a string of high-profile corporate failures hit. It last stood at $865 billion on Dec. 5.The ripple effects from FTX's collapse have boosted Goldman's trading volumes, McDermott said, as investors sought to trade with regulated and well capitalized counterparties.""What's increased is the number of financial institutions wanting to trade with us,"" he said. ""I suspect a number of them traded with FTX, but I can't say that with cast iron certainty.""Goldman also sees recruitment opportunities as crypto and tech companies shed staff, McDermott said, although the bank is happy with the size of its team for now.Others also see the crypto meltdown as a chance to build their businesses.Britannia Financial Group is building its cryptocurrency-related services, its chief executive Mark Bruce told Reuters.The London-based company aims to serve customers who are eager to diversify into digital currencies, but who have never done so before, Bruce said. It will also cater to investors who are very familiar with the assets, but have become nervous about storing funds at crypto exchanges since FTX's collapse.Britannia is applying for more licenses to provide crypto services, such as doing deals for wealthy individuals, he said""We have seen more client interest since the demise of FTX,"" he said. ""Customers have lost trust in some of the younger businesses in the sector that purely do crypto, and are looking for more trusted counterparties.""(Reporting by Iain Withers and Lawrence White, Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Alexander Smith)]"

Indeed, the bank could pour millions of dollars into acquiring companies that are in need right now.""We do see some really interesting opportunities, priced much more sensibly""Goldman Sachs could thus take advantage of its reputation and its mastery of best practices to infuse its know-how into the firms it could control.

If you want to see more best Jim Cramer stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.Jim Cramer is a famous TV personality who hosts the show Mad Money. He is also an anchor on Squawk on the Street. Before TV, Jim Cramer ran a hedge fund, Cramer Berkowitz, that did pretty well. In its 14 years, his hedge fund averaged annual returns of 24%.In terms of his TV picks, Cramer hasn't been as successful as his hedge fund as he often recommends many different stocks across the stock market. As such, it's almost impossible for Cramer to be significantly above average. Investing successfully is more about swinging at good pitches rather than swinging at a ton of pitches. Nevertheless, Cramer can still be informative.In terms of his picks, Jim Cramer has recommended many different stocks. Given blue chips have historically performed better in the long term, this article will focus more on Jim Cramer's blue chip recommendations.In terms of Jim Cramer's recent commentary, he had the following comment about the market and his investing club, ""Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson says he has seen enough of the rally, and he says it’s time to bail. There’s less than 2% upside at the high end of his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 4,000 to 4,150. Stay with defensive stocks and utilities. The industrials have been carrying the market. I wrote about some of the hot old-school stocks lately and how we’re playing the sector for the Club.'2022 has been a volatile year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for many companies is lower than what it was before and broader market valuations have declined as capital has moved from equities to the Treasuries.Although inflation is showing signs of potentially peaking, many investors believe the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises rates too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a recession next year and the fundamentals of even blue chips could weaken. There could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations. As such, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that Jim Cramer has recommended before.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now10.

Although a global recession could make 2023 earnings per share more difficult to achieve, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has had a long history of EPS growth over time and the company has substantial normalized earnings power in the long term. As of 2022, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has increased its annual dividend for 66 straight years.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc.

Osborne sees companies beyond the automakers benefiting from this big mobility trend.“We see a variety of different companies benefiting at Cowen, starting with semiconductors. You have about two to three times the number of semiconductors in an electric vehicle as you do in internal combustion engine vehicle,” Osborne said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.“Some of the tier 1 suppliers that I cover— Aptiv (APTV), for example, is a top idea of mine, as well as Visteon (VC), but there's a variety of plays. Charging and lithium in particular as well are gating obstacles to grow the industry,” Osborne says.By “gating obstacles,” Osborne means there are some factors at play, such as charging infrastructure and lithium production, that are blocking the expansion of the EV transformation in the U.S., but could prove to be strong investments down the line.“I think between now, and say 2027, you have a bit of a red line in the industry as to how quick this industry can grow, Osborn says. “But when you look beyond that, you're seeing the OEMs— GM (GM), Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA)— going straight to the mines. That's allowing them to get better funding terms and move the industry forward.”While short term obstacles like a chip shortage can be addressed by new factories, which take around a year to set up, new mines for lithium can take anywhere from 4 to 7 years to put into production.Story continuesLooking out to mid-decade and beyond, Osborne says he is “very bullish,” especially by 2030 when he sees 30% to 35% penetration for EVs. Among his top picks in mobility are ChargePoint (CHPT), BorgWarner (BWA) Fisker (FSR), Lithium Americas (LAC), Tesla, and Uber (UBER).A Fisker Ocean is displayed during an event outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., November 22, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidNext year, one pick stands apart as the Cowen’s top idea in 2023, and that’s SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), a solar tech company which creates inverters that Osborne says are like a “router” for electrons coming off a homeowner’s solar panel.“When you buy an EV, about 30% to 50% of your electricity consumption is increased at your home, and so more EV owners are going solar, see SolarEdge leading the charge, so to speak, in terms of their ability to manage the electron, so pairing with batteries, pairing with EV chargers, and really being a better constituent with the grid to allow solar to interoperate with utility networks in a much better fashion,” he says.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Media Stocks To Buy Now.Over the past few years, the media industry has undergone a fair amount of change. One major trend observed, particularly post-pandemic, is that of a growing interest in the streaming video industry. As a result, traditional media in the form of newspapers, TV channels, and more is beginning to be replaced by online streaming. With the rise of the streaming video industry, media producers are beginning to face overwhelming pressure to keep producing engaging content and get it in front of their target audiences. According to a Deloitte report on the media sector’s outlook for 2022, in the US, the rate at which people add and cancel paid streaming services averaged around 35% in 2022. This rate of subscription churn is only one factor pressuring media producers to keep putting out hit content and stay on top of their game in an ever-evolving industry.Traditional media companies like Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. Series A (NASDAQ:WBD) and Paramount Global Class B (NASDAQ:PARA), alongside newer, less conventional media companies such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), are finding themselves embroiled in this new and transformative sector. However, these companies are also finding themselves in a better position in the media industry due to global conditions improving. According to a PwC report on the Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook for 2022-2026, the entertainment and media industry has seen an improvement from its contraction in 2020 to resume its growth path. Revenues for the industry rose by 10.4% in 2021. Additionally, the report forecasts that by 2026, the entertainment and media industry will also approach about $3 trillion in revenues.The report envisions the media industry to be a $2.9 trillion market by 2026, one that is more digital, mobile, and pitched at media targeting the younger generations. Between 2022 and 2026, the industry’s revenue is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. Additionally, the report observed a pattern of growing digitization of the entertainment and media industry, a trend that can mean greater profitability for the industry as it works to fit into a newer, more tech-savvy market. In 2021, advertising grew by 22.6%, representing a 32.3% growth in total industry revenues. This growth is largely fed by digital advertisements and their growing popularity within the media industry.Story continuesLet’s now take a look at the 12 best media stocks to buy now.Photo by Myke Simon on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected traditional and new media stocks for our list below, based on a range of factors representing their growth potential.

All right, stick with us because we want to talk to you about an interesting piece regarding Hulu's founding CEO, who has some predictions for the future of Hollywood and streaming, starting with the prediction that there will only be three major streaming networks left, not counting-- here's an important caveat-- Amazon and Apple. And it's not just the prediction of consolidation, Allie, because we've heard a lot about that, but it's the timeline here.And this is from Jason Kilar, an interview with the ""Wall Street Journal,"" a piece he has in the ""Journal"" today. Two years we could be seeing consolidation. It still feels like we are in the early innings of streaming. To have consolidation that quick would be remarkable.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It would. And if you think about how long everything else has taken, cable-- we were just talking about this in the break-- it's been a very slow death for cable.DAVE BRIGGS: 20 or 30 years, yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly. So streaming, a lot of these companies just started at the end of 2019, early 2020. So for two years, to see some M&amp;A, that would be pretty fast, I think. And to me, the big three, that's going to be Netflix, Disney, Warner Brothers Discovery. That who is who I think will survive the streaming wars.DAVE BRIGGS: Would you just kill the Peacock?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I kind of did.DAVE BRIGGS: Did you just kill Paramount and the Peacock?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think Paramount and Peacock could combo and merge.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think they're the smallest-- the smallest fish in the sea.SEANA SMITH: But what was also interesting in this piece in terms of what Jason identified potential winners need to do-- and he used Disney as a perfect example of this-- they need to focus on fan experience and bring that into the digital world. So he worked in potential scenarios of digital theme parks. How fun would it be for your kids to claim that their dorm rooms were Hogwarts?Story continuesHe went on to socially fulfilling video games, epic live digital events that speak to the biggest of fans. We certainly have seen more live events in the digital space, but I haven't personally been to one. But I feel like the feeling out there has been, it's not the same as going to a concert or being there in real life. So I think that could be an interesting part of the business to follow and see who is able to incorporate that the best.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, because ultimately streaming is a loser's game. That's why we're seeing a lot of streaming losses across the board. Content, you have to spend tens of billions-- it's billions with a B-- to compete. So if you're a company that doesn't have the money, doesn't have something that's flowing that free cash flow, you're going to be in trouble.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. And kids today, they're all about the experiences. That was a smart observation by Kilar, who says that this real scale is 300 million subs at $15 a month. That is a monster to accomplish. Allie Canal, thank you so much.]"

More trial details will be presented on Wednesday.""We believe the data continue to support the regimen's differentiated positioning relative to standard of care and are far more favorable than that of Lumakras plus (immunotherapy),"" JP Morgan analyst Eric Joseph said in a research note on Monday, referring to a rival drug sold by Amgen Inc.Both drugs target a mutated form of a gene known as KRAS that occurs in about 13% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease.Mirati's phase-three trial will compare adagrasib and Keytruda with chemotherapy plus Keytruda. The initial treatment for patients with higher levels of PDL1 is Keytruda alone, and Mirati will likely begin planning next year for a combination study in those patients, Meek said.Recent data shows that 19% of NSCLC patients treated with Keytruda plus chemotherapy were alive after five years, compared with 11% of patients treated with a placebo and chemotherapy.Out of seven phase-two trial patients given the adagrasib combination, four (57%) had tumor shrinkage, and none had tumor growth, Mirati said.A preliminary analysis of 53 patients showed that 49% of them had responded to the combination treatment.Story continuesSerious side effects occurred in 44% of patients, including increased levels of pancreatic enzymes in 11% and higher liver enzymes in 8% to 9%.Amgen earlier this year said more study was needed after a trial of Lumakras in combination with immunotherapies found that high numbers of patients experienced liver toxicity.Mirati expects a U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision by Dec. 14 on its application to sell adagrasib for advanced NSCLC patients who have stopped responding to other drugs.Meek declined to comment on takeover speculation that had pushed shares of Mirati up nearly 40% since mid-November.""We're laser-focused on crossing the finish line with the approval and then we have to launch the drug .... We're so busy right now,"" he said. (Reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Bradley Perrett)]"

The following day, David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures, said:""When we start to see inflationary data showing that inflation is coming down, there is an expectation that the Fed is going to begin to slow the pace of those interest rate hikes.""He further added:""Hence you could argue that the dramatic pressure that has been applied to the gold market over the last several months has been released and gold now has the ability to move higher.""Gold DemandGold demand surged at the beginning of the year by 34% YoY and the prices rose by 8%. The demand in Q1 was 19% above the 5-year average.

FCX, Southern Copper Corp. SCCO and First Quantum Minerals FQVLF.Industry: Non-Ferrous MetalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2025172/3-non-ferrous-metal-mining-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak as apprehensions about slowing demand and economic activity have been weighing down commodity prices. Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy as well as labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Southern Copper Corp. and First Quantum Minerals. These are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process.Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit followed by assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly precede actual mining. The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of an Economic Slowdown Weighing on Commodity Prices: Copper prices have declined for most part of this year due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession.Story continuesSilver prices have also been negatively impacted this year, thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Gold prices also felt the pressure of a rallying dollar and Treasury yields. However, recently, metal prices have found support amid expectations of a pickup in industrial demand as Fed Chair Powell signaled that the central bank may slow the pace of rate hikes this month. Concerns of low supply are also aiding prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues.Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternative energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance: The industry players are currently dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future given their wide usage in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials.Demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy are expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals. While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term.

While the Fed has flagged smaller rate hikes in the coming months, the central bank also warned that rates could peak at much higher-than-expected levels.Such a scenario would be negative for most non-yielding assets, with gold likely to be impacted the most. The central bank is now set to meet next week in its last meeting for 2022.Spot gold was flat around $1,769.30 an ounce, while gold futures were steady at $1,781.55 an ounce. Both instruments tumbled around 1.7% on Monday, their worst day in nearly three months.Rising interest rates were the biggest weight on bullion prices this year, as higher yields on debt pushed up the opportunity cost of holding gold. While the yellow metal has recovered from lows hit earlier this year, its outlook remains constrained by uncertainty over the path of U.S. interest rates.Other precious metals were also subdued on Tuesday after falling sharply in the prior session. Platinum futures fell 0.1%, while silver futures were flat around $22.422 an ounce. Both metals plunged 2.4% and 4.4% on Monday respectively.Among industrial metals, copper prices reversed early gains on Monday as fears of higher interest rates largely offset optimism over a potential recovery in Chinese demand.Copper futures were flat around $3.7900 a pound after plummeting 2% in the prior session.Story continuesWhile the red metal marked a strong recovery over the past two weeks on growing optimism over the withdrawal of anti-COVID measures in China, fears that higher interest rates will further stymie economic activity appeared to have cut short the recovery.China has still given no signal that it will scale back the entirety of its zero-COVID policy, having so far scaled back only select measures in its major cities.Related ArticlesGold slumps below $1,800 as Fed fears resurfaceOil rises on China optimism after steep drop, but Fed fears persistOil prices rise after price cap on Russian crude, OPEC+ meeting]"

Investments don’t have to be limited to traditional stocks and bonds, sometimes the most valuable investments are the tangible goods that are all around us—these are called commodities.What are commodities? Commodities are an asset class made up of raw materials used to make consumer goods. These materials can help diversify an investor's mix of assets and spread risk across different asset types.“A commodity is a good or service whose wide availability diminishes the importance of factors other than price (such as brand name, uniqueness, or appeal) in determining its value,"" says Thomas Samuelson, CFA, CMT, and chief investment officer at Vineyard Global Advisors. ""A commodity is fungible, in that there is typically little differentiation between supply from different sources.”Some of the most common commodities to invest in typically fall into one of the following categories:Agricultural: This type of commodity usually includes goods like coffee, corn, sugar, soybeans, and wheat. These crops are commonly used in popular consumer products and can be a source of food for humans and livestock as well.Energy: Energy commodities include crude oil used to fuel transportations and the production of plastics, natural gas used for electricity, and gasoline, which powers personal vehicles.Metals: Metals include gold, used in making jewelry; silver, also used for jewelry and many other industrial uses as well; and copper, the most widely used form of electrical wiring.Livestock: [hotlink]Popular[/hotlink] livestock like cattle and hogs are considered commodities.How do you invest in commodities?There are a few different ways you might invest in commodities or gain exposure to them:Purchasing the physical commodity. It’s possible to purchase a raw commodity, like a gold bar. However, if you go this route, you’ll need to account for the costs associated with holding a physical commodity like storage fees.Investing in commodity stocks or ETFs. If investing in physical commodities isn’t your speed, you can indirectly invest in commodities by investing in commodity stocks. These are stocks in companies that produce or process certain commodities. ""This approach benefits from both commodity price increases and the potential of the company to add value by increasing production of a particular commodity or providing income through the payment of a dividend,” says Samuelson. A commodity ETF tracks the prices of a commodity or that commodity's corresponding index and gives an investor ownership over a set of contracts backed by the commodity.Story continuesPros and cons of investing in commodities Like any other investment, commodities are not without their own set of benefits and drawbacks. If you’re thinking about investing in commodities, here are some of the major pros and cons to note:View this interactive chart on Fortune.comPro: Commodities can generate short-term profits. There’s no real way to time the market, but if you happen to purchase and sell a commodity at the right time, you could generate a significant profit. ""Since futures contracts generally require only a 5% margin, you could control $100,000 of copper for an initial investment of only $5,000. If the underlying price of copper rose 10%, the value of the copper you control would increase from $100,000 to $110,000 providing a $10,000 profit, but the return on your initial investment of $5,000 would be 100% ($10,000 profit on $5,000 initial investment),” says Samuelson. “Of course, you need to be right on the direction of the price of copper, and you can get a margin call requiring you to put up more money if the position moves against you.”Pro: Commodities can be a hedge against inflation. These assets tend to rise during times of high inflation when the value of the dollar sinks. According to 2021 research from Vanguard based on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, a 1% rise in unexpected inflation would produce a 7% to 9% rise in commodities.Con: Commodities can be extremely volatile. While commodities may not behave like other asset classes, they can still be risky. ""Commodities are notoriously volatile, and predicting their price movements can be difficult,” says Samuelson. “Unknowable events such as weather, geopolitics, and the global economic outlook can dramatically impact the supply and demand, and thus the price of commodities.”Con: Commodities don’t produce income for investors. Some investments like stocks, bonds, and real estate produce regular income for investors through dividends or rental income, but commodities do not produce income for investors unless they’re sold and a profit is realized from that sale.The takeaway Knowing the different types of investments available for you to invest in and how they typically behave can help you broaden your scope, diversify your portfolio, and potentially help hedge against inflation during times of economic turmoil.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

If you want to read about some more betting companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Betting Companies In The World.The betting industry comprises sports betting as well as gambling and lottery businesses. The betting sector was hit hard by the pandemic and the prolonged coronavirus lockdowns in China but has started on the road to recovery in the past few months as Macau reopens and online betting trends, with the advent of world sporting events like the NFL, the UEFA Champions League, the NBA, and the FIFA World Cup, continue to grow at a rapid pace. The global betting market is expected to grow to $8 billion in revenue over the next few years.  Overall, the market size for the industry will hit $200 billion within this decade, growing at a scary compound annual growth rate of around 9% from 2022 onwards. The legalization of sports betting in countries like the US, where betting firms offer services in fifty states, is expected to have a huge impact on the global betting market. The US typically accounts for more than 40% of total gambling revenue worldwide, mostly as a result of activities concentrated in the betting hub of Las Vegas. Some of the top firms operating in the betting sector include Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS). Generally, bets allow people to put money on the line keeping in sight the outcome of an event. For example, the desired outcome results in the one who placed the bet getting paid in an enhanced manner, while if the desired outcome is not achieved, the money on the line is lost in the wager.

It provides a diversity of operations in various sectors like sports gambling, casinos gaming, lotteries, keno and media on a secure platform. The firm is exploring different digital avenues to maximize earnings. The revenue of this company is in excess of $3.15 billion. 13.

The revenue of the firm is more than $3.13 billion and the company is closely associated with the British royal family as well. 12. Kindred GroupMarket Capitalization: $2 BillionKindred Group was founded in Malta in 1997 and is one of the largest betting groups consisting of 9 brands including Unibet, Maria, Casino and 32red. It offers products like online casino, game betting, online poker and online bingo. The betting platforms of the firm serve over 2000 people of 60+ nationalities. It earns more than $800 million in revenue per year. 11. Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN)Market Capitalization: $5 BillionPenn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) provides integrated entertainment, sports content, and casino gaming experiences. Penn’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company has a healthy regional casino business and a strong balance sheet to fund its digital losses. Founded in 1972, in Pennsylvania, USA, it is one of the largest property holders, with about 43 betting properties in the USA and Canada. It has an annual revenue that exceeds  $3.1 billion. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm HG Vora Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) with 7.5 million shares worth more than $206 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Penn Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 28.3% in the quarter and penalized performance by 71 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in growth. The company has seen no material change to its visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. Penn is generating strong cash flow to more than offset investments in its digital growth opportunity. It is using excess cash to buy back its stock. Penn is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession and, if one does occur, the company should still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels.Management continues to use its excess cash for share repurchases and debt reduction as well as continuing investments in its digital businesses. We think the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business is modest in relation to Penn’s $1 billion of casino EBITDA. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as Penn builds its customer base.""10. Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNW)Market Capitalization: $6 BillionLight &amp; Wonder, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNW), formerly known as Scientific Games, is an online gaming platform from Nevada, USA. It provides instant lottery games, lottery gaming systems, terminals and services, internet applications, server based interactive gaming machines and game control systems.

Here is what the fund said:“Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) is one of the largest and most successful casino entertainment companies in the U.S. The company owns and operates 28 casino gaming properties in 10 states with a large presence in Las Vegas. Business conditions have been strong, yet the shares are valued at only 6 times 2022 estimated cash flow versus a long-term average of more than 9 times cash flow. The company maintains a strong and liquid balance sheet. Insiders own approximately 27% of the company. We believe Boyd is a compelling acquisition target.”8. DraftKings Inc.

Sports betting and i-gaming are rolling out with great fanfare and success across the country; however, investors seem concerned about competition and margins. Most participants are spending heavily on marketing and promotions, which is cutting into margins. We see this as worthy investment in customer acquisition at a moment in time when revenues are just building. We continue to believe that online sports betting and gaming will be enormous industries, that DraftKings will be a leading player. We think the business will have high margins as it matures. We believe we are underwriting the business conservatively and see much upside in the long term.”7.

Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.national-cancer-institute-GcrSgHDrniY-unsplashDon Zurbay: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be speaking with you for the first time as Patterson's CEO. I'm honored to be leading the outstanding Patterson team, whose commitment to our strategy, customer, vision and values has enabled a track record of strong financial performance. I'm pleased with our performance during our fiscal '23 second quarter. As we navigated ongoing macroeconomic challenges during the quarter, we remain focused on driving sales execution and profitability. Overall, for the quarter, we achieved $1.6 billion in consolidated revenue representing year over internal sales growth of nearly 1%. Year-over-year operating margin expansion in both our Dental and Animal Health segments, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.63, an increase of 9% year-over-year.Given our results through the first half and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year EPS guidance range and remain committed to delivering internal sales growth and operating margin expansion for fiscal '23. Now, before walking through the details of our quarter, I want to take this opportunity to share my perspective on the key elements of Paterson success; our culture, strategy and our people. Patterson's purpose, vision and values is foundational to our success. And like our employees across Patterson, I am committed to ensuring that they are followed. We are passionate and people first. Doing the right thing and being good to each other are my own beliefs that I will use to continue to guide Patterson moving forward.In my previous role of Patterson Company CFO, I worked closely with the rest of our executive leadership team to develop the strategy that has enabled us to accelerate business performance and drive long-term value for our customers as well as our shareholders. Looking ahead, we will continue to execute that strategy, which is focused on three foundational pillars. First, continuously deepening the value proposition we offer our customers in both the Dental and Animal Health segments. Patterson is so much more than a distributor. We are an indispensable partner to our customers and play a critical role in their success. We believe that expanding our capabilities for customers will continue to drive sales growth and strengthen these relationships.Second, enhancing our margin performance to fully capture the value we create in the market with a focus on operational excellence, improved mix and thoughtful coordination with our strategic manufacturing partners. And third, managing the organization with a keen focus on cost discipline. As you would imagine developing a rigorous process for cost discipline and return on our investments has been a key focus for me throughout my tenure with Patterson, and will continue to be in my new role. Patterson's balanced capital allocation approach supports our strategy with three priorities. First is investing with discipline in the core areas of our business, including our people and the support organizations to drive ongoing improvements in our field sales and service execution.These functions enable Paterson to deliver the high-level of service that our customers reward us for as they navigate markets in good times and more challenging ones. Prioritizing investment ensures we don't take our foot off the gas. Second, our dividend remains an effective means of returning cash to our shareholders. As a reminder, in fiscal '22, we returned approximately $100 million to shareholders through our dividend. Third, we regularly evaluate opportunities to leverage our strong balance sheet and make strategic investments. As we've said before, we will be thoughtful and selective on opportunities that will further enhance our strategies, meet our financial criteria and drive improved returns for our shareholders. For example, in the second quarter, Patterson announced acquisitions of Dairy Tech, and RSVP and ACT.These are examples of our business units identifying areas where they want to focus and using M&amp;A to help them execute. Our strong financial position and balance sheet provide us with flexibility to continue to pursue these opportunities to accelerate future growth and profitability. Taken together, we have a great foundation to build from through the continued execution of our proven strategy I am confident in our future. Ultimately, is our people who execute on that strategy. Our people are a key differentiator for Patterson and I'm so proud of the way our team supports each other and the dedication they have to serving our customers. Across our organization we are fortunate to have a talented and driven team that is resilient and knows the power of working together to support each other.Over the past several years, Patterson has cultivated a deep bench of highly capable executive leaders who have all been instrumental in developing and implementing Patterson's strategy. We expect continued benefit from the expertise, teamwork and continuity of our existing leadership team. I'm also pleased to keep working closely with Kevin Barry in his new capacity. As our former Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller, Kevin has been an integral member of the executive leadership team in the finance organization. Internal promotions and succession demonstrate the depth of Patterson's talent, and Kevin is certainly a part of that. I have complete confidence in his ability to take on this important responsibility. You'll have an opportunity to hear from Kevin in his remarks to walk through the details of our second quarter performance shortly.I believe our executive leadership team and strategy will enable us to maintain our strong performance. Patterson has all the elements to create value for our customers and shareholders alike, a strong position and too attractive and healthy end markets, entrenched relationships with customers that view Patterson as an indispensable partner, a clear and focused strategy to drive profitable growth and the financial foundation to ensure we can invest to position this company for long-term success. With that overview, I'll turn to a discussion of our segments financial performance starting with Dental. Our Dental segment grew internal sales nearly 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong performance in our equipment and value added service categories.Outstanding execution by our teams enabled our Dental segment to reach double-digit operating margins and year-over-year operating margin expansion, as we continue to deliver a strong mix favoring the higher margin areas of our business. We remain focused on advancing and strengthening key margin enhancement initiatives by mitigating the impact of an inflationary environment, strengthening our mutually beneficial vendor relationships and focusing on operational efficiencies including mix management, and logistics productivity. For consumables, our internal sales in the first quarter declined mid-single-digits year-over-year, primarily due to the persistent deflationary impact of certain infection control products. We continue to provide a broad range of infection control products because they are foundational to the practice of dentistry.And while the demand for these offerings is lower than the peak levels of the pandemic, we remain strong in comparison to pre-COVID levels, as dentists have adapted to meet a higher standard of care. As we have previously discussed, improvements in the supply chain for infection control products have resulted in considerable pricing declines from the pandemic highs for certain products in this category. We expect this deflationary pressure in the infection control category to persist at least through the remainder of the fiscal year. Notably, Patterson achieved year-over-year internal sales growth in our non-infection control portfolio in the fiscal second quarter. We continue to leverage our broad consumables offering including private label products to deepen our relationships with customers across the spectrum from independent private practices to regional and national DSOs. We expect the overall consumables market to normalize to a low-single-digit percentage growth rate over the long-term.Dental financial performance in the equipment category reflects what makes Patterson Patterson. Our customers recognize Patterson's expertise in supporting the full purchase, training and maintenance cycle of the latest technology and equipment. They feel confident investing in their practices with Patterson as their partner, knowing they have access to hands on support from the Patterson Technology Center and the deep knowledge and service our local branch teams provide. Internal sales in Dental equipment in the second quarter were up double digits year-over-year, benefiting from improved demand for digital equipment portfolio and continued momentum in the core equipment category. As we previously discussed, equipment sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.But Patterson has delivered year-over-year equipment sales growth averaging nearly 14% for the last eight quarters. We continue to see that dentists are making equipment investments to keep their practices running well and maintaining their planned upgrade or replacement schedules. During the second quarter, our value added services category delivered solid high-single-digit growth driven by our field technical service offering. We're proud that our customers turn to and trust Patterson to ensure their equipment is delivering for their practice. This category also benefited from growth in the sales of our practice management software products, which our customers see as the foundation of their practice operations. The Dental business is supported by resilient long-term trends including an ageing population, practice modernization and a growing appreciation for oral health as a key link to overall health.We are confident in our ability to continue to effectively manage through the current macroeconomic environment to achieve our goals in fiscal '23 and beyond. Let's now turn to the Animal Health segment. During the second quarter of our fiscal '23, we leveraged the depth of our offering and breadth of our channel presence to deliver solid performance in the face of more challenging external market conditions. Patterson has an omni-channel presence that spans a wide range of animal species and offers a comprehensive solution for diverse customers, ranging from large producer operations with onsite veterinarians to independent vet clinics to individuals shopping at their local veterinary supply retailer. Our Animal Health segment achieved internal sales growth of nearly 1% year-over-year, driven by mid-single-digit growth in companion animal and a low-single-digit decline in production animal.Despite some softness on the top line, which we attributed primarily to external factors, including staffing shortages and veterinary clinics, weather conditions impacting producers and the impact of a widely used product in the production animal market that has recently gone off patent, Patterson was still able to expand its operating margins in the Animal Health segment. Our success expanding margins was the result of our team's laser focus on mix, including the growth of our accretive private label and e-services offerings and continuing to enhance our relationships with strategic manufacturing partners who reward us for our performance. In our companion business, I'm particularly proud of our growth this quarter when you put our performance in context.First, the broader market growth has continued to moderate in line with our expectations. Second, our results are compared to the extraordinary 21% sales growth Patterson achieved in the prior year period. We attribute this sustained outperformance of the market to our ability to serve more and more veterinary practices as they recognize the value we offer in a dynamic market environment as well as the deep relationships Paterson has with our preferred manufacturing partners, and the growth of our private label portfolio. We're continuing to invest in the companion animal business in ways that deepen our value proposition and address critical customer needs. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire RSVP and ACT, which stands for Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies, respectively.These are entities that provide innovative solutions to veterinary practices through data extraction and conversion, staffing and video-based training services. We believe this proposed acquisition will expand our companion animal capabilities in three key areas. First, ACT provides an in-house platform for data extraction and conversion capabilities, which will enhance our software offerings and provide better insights both for our business and our vet customers. Second, as RSVP is a staffing business that connects short staffed clinics to the resources they need, this acquisition will help resolve a critical pain point for clinics and address a growing trend in part time vet and technician work. This is particularly compelling given the staffing challenges our customers are facing today.Finally, ACT will help Patterson expand its educational offerings, including the addition of a state recognized certification program for vet assistants. As we've previously discussed, our established education platform, Patterson Veterinary University, is a key component of our value proposition for companion animal customers. Working alongside customers to help them establish and enhance their practices lays the foundation for a meaningful long-term partnership. Importantly, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity of the companion animal market. Data shows that today's pet parents are increasingly dedicated to the health and well-being of their pets and willing to invest in the care that veterinarians provide. We believe that over the long-term people who own pets will continue to invest in their care throughout the pets lifetime and own more pets during their life.On the production animal side, our internal sales performance was challenged by the impact of pricing pressures on a broadly used product Draxxin that now faces generic competition. While this pricing pressure was not unexpected in the market, it still had an effect on our internal sales. Excluding the deflationary impact of this product, our production animal sales were up about 1%, reflecting positive fundamental growth over the extraordinarily strong 11% growth in the prior year comparative period. We attribute our positive financial performance in the production business to Patterson service model in a market where we believe customers generally prefer to develop a long-term relationship with a single supply partner. We provide producers with a customized combination of hands on service and delivery options, and a comprehensive product and service portfolio which they increasingly demand.Our differentiated model has continued to enable us to win new customers and outperform the broader production animal market. And we are focused on continuing to differentiate Paterson with the addition of new critical capabilities. A recently announced agreement to acquire Dairy Tech is expected to expand our value added platform within our production animal business. Dairy Tech provides pasteurizing equipment and single use bags to safely produce, store and feed colostrum, a necessary nutrient for newborn calves. This is a critical capability for our cattle producer customers, and we expect our acquisition of Dairy Tech to efficiently and effectively support the health of the producers herd. We believe this acquisition will align well with several key trends we're observing in the market, including producers looking for more efficient ways to manage costs and improve profitability, a continued market emphasis on biosecurity and herd health and strong global demand for protein and dairy.As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal '23, our Animal Health business will continue to focus on accelerating our momentum of strong sales execution, operational excellence and deepening our value proposition to better serve our customers. And now we will turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our fiscal '23 second quarter financial performance in more detail.See also 10 Undervalued European Stocks To Buy and Largest Renewable Energy Companies by Market Cap.Kevin Barry: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a sincere thank you to Don and our Board for the opportunity to serve in this new role. I'm also grateful for the increasing levels of responsibility and formal mentoring Don has given me over the past several years. And it's a privilege to be a part of the very talented and committed leadership team here at Patterson. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our second quarter of fiscal '23, which ended October 29, 2022, and then conclude with a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our second quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '23 second quarter were $1.63 billion, a decrease of 1.4% versus the second quarter one year ago.Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation increased 0.7% compared to the same period last year. Our second quarter fiscal '23 gross margin was 20.2%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 60 basis points this quarter by the mark-to-market accounting adjustment from rising interest rates on our equipment financing portfolio. However, this negative impact was nearly offset by the gain in our corresponding hedging instrument, which is reflected in the interest and other expense line on our P&amp;L. So the net result has a minimal impact on our adjusted earnings per share. This dynamic also occurred in the second fiscal quarter of last year, when the negative impact of the mark-to-market accounting calculation was 20 basis points.We're normalizing for the negative impact in both periods for an alternative view of how our business is operating. Our gross margin is up 80 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase in gross margin reflects our continued focus on pricing and cost execution and driving an improved mix with higher gross margin accretive product categories. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '23 were 15.9%, and unfavorable by 60 basis points compared to one year ago. In the fiscal '23 second quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.3%, a decline of 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Again normalizing for the negative impact from the mark-to-market valuation of our equipment financing portfolio, our consolidated adjusted operating margins for the fiscal second quarter improved by 30 basis points compared to the prior year.We remain focused on driving continued operating margin expansion through our efforts to improve gross margin with pricing and cost execution, working more closely with strategic vendors to reward us for our sales performance, driving improved mix as well as exercising expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure as we grow the top line. With these collective efforts, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion in both of our business segments and our total business for fiscal '23. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was 24.2%, a decrease of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be in line with prior year. Reported net income attributable to Patterson companies.Inc., for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $54.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the second quarter of last year of $48.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., in the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $61.2 million or $0.63 per diluted share. This compares to $57.1 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '22. This increase is primarily due to the operating margin expansion in both of our business segments. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with our Dental business. In the second quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Dental business increased 1.6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22.Internal sales of dental consumables declined 4.9% compared to one year ago. As Don mentioned earlier, we continue to experience the deflationary impact of infection control products compared to the prior year. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 1.0% in the fiscal second quarter compared to the year ago period. We expect the deflationary impact of infection control products to continue for the remainder of fiscal '23. Internal sales of dental equipment and software increased 11.1% compared to one year ago. In core equipment, our double-digit sales increase in the quarter reflects our continued efforts to manage the supply chain as category to deliver and install the equipment our dental customers have ordered to update their practices or open new dental offices.Sales of digital equipment products were also up double digits, and sales of CAD/CAM products declined mid single digits in the quarter. Internal sales of value added services in the second quarter of fiscal '23 increased 7.8% over the prior year period, led by the strong year-over-year performance of our technical service team and double-digit growth of our software business. Value added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice, and these valuable offerings are also mix favorable to our P&amp;L. Adjusted operating margins in Dental were 10.2% in the fiscal second quarter and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year period. This strong performance reflects the efforts of our dental team to improve gross margins and exercise continued expense discipline compared to the prior year period.Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. In the second quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.7% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. Internal sales for our companion animal business increased 3.5% with the U.S companion animal business growing by 4.5% in the quarter. Internal sales for our production animal business decreased 2.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year as the production animal market has been affected by the deflationary impact of the key branded product that recently came off patent. And as Don mentioned, it's now experiencing generic competition. Excluding this deflationary impact, internal sales for our production animal business increased by 0.7%, and industry data would indicate that our sales team and production continues to outperform the overall market during the fiscal second quarter.Adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 3.8% in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. Our Animal Health team continues to drive business with strategic manufacturer partners who value our ability to move market share while also exercising expense discipline. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first 6 months of fiscal '23, our free cash flow declined by $88.4 million compared to the same period one year ago. This was primarily due to an increased level of working capital in the first 6 months of fiscal '23, driven by strategic inventory purchases and timing of accounts payable. Now turning to capital allocation. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to shareholders.In the second quarter of fiscal '23, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid in the third quarter of fiscal '23. On a year-to-date basis, Patterson has returned $65.7 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Also during the second fiscal quarter, as previously disclosed, we successfully amended and extended our credit facility. Even in this challenging credit environment, we achieved favorable terms, while maintaining our existing lending group, demonstrating the confidence our lenders have and the ongoing strength of our business. This new facility provides the capacity and flexibility to continue investing in our core business and to execute on strategic transactions. Let me conclude with some comments on our outlook for fiscal '23.Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal '23 GAAP earnings guidance of $1.96 to $2.06 per diluted share, and our adjusted earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. We intend to deliver internal sales growth and operating margin expansion for fiscal '23 and remain committed to achieving our guidance for the fiscal year. And now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments.Don Zurbay: Thanks, Kevin. A few final comments before we open it up for Q&amp;A. First, I want to again thank the entire Patterson team. I'm proud of their work in delivering another strong quarter and their dedicated focus on supporting our customers. Second, despite macroeconomic challenges, the performance of this quarter demonstrates the strength of our strategy, discipline and execution of our talented team and continued momentum within our end markets. With this winning combination, I am confident in Patterson's ability to succeed in any environment and look forward to what we can accomplish together. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
136,6db66763-3611-3455-abd1-c6def7cbbe90,MAS,2022-12-06,Is There Now An Opportunity In Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-masco-corporation-nyse-123834399.html,1670330314,STORY,['MAS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Masco’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Masco What Is Masco Worth?Great news for investors – Masco is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $64.16, but it is currently trading at US$49.41 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Masco’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Masco generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Masco, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 8.7%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since MAS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MAS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MAS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've found that Masco has 3 warning signs (1 is a bit concerning!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.If you are no longer interested in Masco, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

137,dfc0a2fc-81a5-3e84-9a86-6fcebce4b11f,BK,2022-12-06,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 78% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-nyse-121601080.html,1670328961,STORY,['BK'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Bank of New York Mellon. See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bank of New York Mellon?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Bank of New York Mellon. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Bank of New York Mellon, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Bank of New York Mellon is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. With 7.8% and 7.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Bank of New York MellonWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$34m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Bank of New York Mellon. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 7.7% of Bank of New York Mellon stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Bank of New York Mellon , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) share price has soared 136% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. And in the last month, the share price has gained 12%. But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 5.7% in the last month.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Mastercard managed to grow its earnings per share at 19% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 19%. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Mastercard has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Mastercard, it has a TSR of 142% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Mastercard shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 7.5% over the last year. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 19% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

FCX, Southern Copper Corp. SCCO and First Quantum Minerals FQVLF.Industry: Non-Ferrous MetalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2025172/3-non-ferrous-metal-mining-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak as apprehensions about slowing demand and economic activity have been weighing down commodity prices. Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy as well as labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Southern Copper Corp. and First Quantum Minerals. These are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process.Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit followed by assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly precede actual mining. The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of an Economic Slowdown Weighing on Commodity Prices: Copper prices have declined for most part of this year due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession.Story continuesSilver prices have also been negatively impacted this year, thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Gold prices also felt the pressure of a rallying dollar and Treasury yields. However, recently, metal prices have found support amid expectations of a pickup in industrial demand as Fed Chair Powell signaled that the central bank may slow the pace of rate hikes this month. Concerns of low supply are also aiding prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues.Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternative energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance: The industry players are currently dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future given their wide usage in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials.Demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy are expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals. While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 19% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of this year, the industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 38%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 7.1% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector growth of 1.8%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 12.8% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 4.95X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.03X. The Basic Materials sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is at 6.32X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 8.88X and as low as 3.42X, with the median being at 6.03X.3 Mining-Non Ferrous Stocks to Keep an Eye onFreeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in an incremental annual production of around 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum.Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves.  It is assessing a large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci also increased milling rates. The Lone Star project in eastern Arizona has been completed and is on track to produce more than 200 million pounds of copper annually.The company is looking to advance studies for potential expansions and long-term development options for its large-scale sulfide resources at Lone Star. It is also ramping up underground production at Grasberg in Indonesia, resulting in a spike in milling rates. Focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable. Shares of FCX have gained 7.6% over the past year.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCX’s earnings for 2023 indicates year-over-year growth of 0.6%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Southern Copper: The company has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates world-class assets in investment-grade countries, such as Mexico and Peru. Its constant focus on increasing low-cost production is commendable.SCCO expects copper production in 2023 to reach 926,000 tons, with the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista. It will gain from its efforts to grow in Peru, given that the country is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves.Peru’s national output is anticipated grow to 206,999 by next year. Southern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion. Michiquillay is expected to become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will produce 225,000 tons of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash-cost. The company's shares have gained 5.4% in the past year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Phoenix, AZ-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 7% over the past 30 days. The company, which engages in mining, exploring, smelting, and refining copper and other minerals, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.First Quantum Minerals: The company’s platform of cash generating and geographically diversified operating assets poises it well for growth. Focus on operational improvements has resulted in strong production from Cobre Panama and Sentinel in the last reported quarter.The company recently signed a long-term renewable power contract for the CP100 Expansion project at Cobre Panama, which shifts the total energy mix at the mine to approximately 20% renewable by the end of 2023, marking an important step toward achieving its target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. FQVLF foresees 1 million tons of annual copper production through its organic brownfield opportunities.At Cobre Panama, the CP100 Expansion seems to be on track to add 100 million tons by the end of 2023. At Kansanshi mine, the ongoing S3 Expansion project will boost production and extend the mine life for two more decades. First ore production is expected at the Enterprise project in the first half of 2023. It is a low-cost, high-grade nickel sulfideproject with annual nickel production of 30 thousand tons over an 11-year mine life. The company's shares have gained 10.3% in the past year.Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, First Quantum Minerals is a global mining company primarily producing copper, with secondary production in gold, nickel, zinc and cobalt.

While the Fed has flagged smaller rate hikes in the coming months, the central bank also warned that rates could peak at much higher-than-expected levels.Such a scenario would be negative for most non-yielding assets, with gold likely to be impacted the most. The central bank is now set to meet next week in its last meeting for 2022.Spot gold was flat around $1,769.30 an ounce, while gold futures were steady at $1,781.55 an ounce. Both instruments tumbled around 1.7% on Monday, their worst day in nearly three months.Rising interest rates were the biggest weight on bullion prices this year, as higher yields on debt pushed up the opportunity cost of holding gold. While the yellow metal has recovered from lows hit earlier this year, its outlook remains constrained by uncertainty over the path of U.S. interest rates.Other precious metals were also subdued on Tuesday after falling sharply in the prior session. Platinum futures fell 0.1%, while silver futures were flat around $22.422 an ounce. Both metals plunged 2.4% and 4.4% on Monday respectively.Among industrial metals, copper prices reversed early gains on Monday as fears of higher interest rates largely offset optimism over a potential recovery in Chinese demand.Copper futures were flat around $3.7900 a pound after plummeting 2% in the prior session.Story continuesWhile the red metal marked a strong recovery over the past two weeks on growing optimism over the withdrawal of anti-COVID measures in China, fears that higher interest rates will further stymie economic activity appeared to have cut short the recovery.China has still given no signal that it will scale back the entirety of its zero-COVID policy, having so far scaled back only select measures in its major cities.Related ArticlesGold slumps below $1,800 as Fed fears resurfaceOil rises on China optimism after steep drop, but Fed fears persistOil prices rise after price cap on Russian crude, OPEC+ meeting]"

Investments don’t have to be limited to traditional stocks and bonds, sometimes the most valuable investments are the tangible goods that are all around us—these are called commodities.What are commodities? Commodities are an asset class made up of raw materials used to make consumer goods. These materials can help diversify an investor's mix of assets and spread risk across different asset types.“A commodity is a good or service whose wide availability diminishes the importance of factors other than price (such as brand name, uniqueness, or appeal) in determining its value,"" says Thomas Samuelson, CFA, CMT, and chief investment officer at Vineyard Global Advisors. ""A commodity is fungible, in that there is typically little differentiation between supply from different sources.”Some of the most common commodities to invest in typically fall into one of the following categories:Agricultural: This type of commodity usually includes goods like coffee, corn, sugar, soybeans, and wheat. These crops are commonly used in popular consumer products and can be a source of food for humans and livestock as well.Energy: Energy commodities include crude oil used to fuel transportations and the production of plastics, natural gas used for electricity, and gasoline, which powers personal vehicles.Metals: Metals include gold, used in making jewelry; silver, also used for jewelry and many other industrial uses as well; and copper, the most widely used form of electrical wiring.Livestock: [hotlink]Popular[/hotlink] livestock like cattle and hogs are considered commodities.How do you invest in commodities?There are a few different ways you might invest in commodities or gain exposure to them:Purchasing the physical commodity. It’s possible to purchase a raw commodity, like a gold bar. However, if you go this route, you’ll need to account for the costs associated with holding a physical commodity like storage fees.Investing in commodity stocks or ETFs. If investing in physical commodities isn’t your speed, you can indirectly invest in commodities by investing in commodity stocks. These are stocks in companies that produce or process certain commodities. ""This approach benefits from both commodity price increases and the potential of the company to add value by increasing production of a particular commodity or providing income through the payment of a dividend,” says Samuelson. A commodity ETF tracks the prices of a commodity or that commodity's corresponding index and gives an investor ownership over a set of contracts backed by the commodity.Story continuesPros and cons of investing in commodities Like any other investment, commodities are not without their own set of benefits and drawbacks. If you’re thinking about investing in commodities, here are some of the major pros and cons to note:View this interactive chart on Fortune.comPro: Commodities can generate short-term profits. There’s no real way to time the market, but if you happen to purchase and sell a commodity at the right time, you could generate a significant profit. ""Since futures contracts generally require only a 5% margin, you could control $100,000 of copper for an initial investment of only $5,000. If the underlying price of copper rose 10%, the value of the copper you control would increase from $100,000 to $110,000 providing a $10,000 profit, but the return on your initial investment of $5,000 would be 100% ($10,000 profit on $5,000 initial investment),” says Samuelson. “Of course, you need to be right on the direction of the price of copper, and you can get a margin call requiring you to put up more money if the position moves against you.”Pro: Commodities can be a hedge against inflation. These assets tend to rise during times of high inflation when the value of the dollar sinks. According to 2021 research from Vanguard based on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, a 1% rise in unexpected inflation would produce a 7% to 9% rise in commodities.Con: Commodities can be extremely volatile. While commodities may not behave like other asset classes, they can still be risky. ""Commodities are notoriously volatile, and predicting their price movements can be difficult,” says Samuelson. “Unknowable events such as weather, geopolitics, and the global economic outlook can dramatically impact the supply and demand, and thus the price of commodities.”Con: Commodities don’t produce income for investors. Some investments like stocks, bonds, and real estate produce regular income for investors through dividends or rental income, but commodities do not produce income for investors unless they’re sold and a profit is realized from that sale.The takeaway Knowing the different types of investments available for you to invest in and how they typically behave can help you broaden your scope, diversify your portfolio, and potentially help hedge against inflation during times of economic turmoil.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

In the ever-evolving and often strange world of investing, investors who seek value plays can follow the Roundhill Acquirers Deep Value ETF, which offers retail and institutional investors exposure to largely undervalued stocks, and seeks investment results that closely track the performance of the Acquirers Deep Value Index. The fund has $42 million in assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.80%. The Roundhill Acquirers Deep Value ETF was launched on September 23, 2014. David Einhorn, the portfolio manager of Greenlight Capital, said in the beginning of October 2022 that value investing might never be mainstream again. He noted that there are very few market participants who are actually well versed in value investing, and most investors have turned to passive and quantitative investing. He said that “nobody knows what anything is worth” and explaining his stance further, Einhorn told Bloomberg: “So there’s an enormous number of companies that are dramatically mis-valued in ways that we haven’t seen before.”On the other hand, Aaron Dunn and Brad Galko, Co-Heads of the Value team at Eaton Vance, part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, stated on June 17 that financial services, healthcare, and industrials may provide lucrative investment opportunities in the current market backdrop. They noted that companies manufacturing medical technology and pharmaceuticals are also attractive value-investing plays. Some of the best value stocks include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap. The semiconductor industry is among the most popular and lucrative sectors in the world. With chips now starting to be heralded as the 'new oil', their ubiquity has ensured that the modern day world can not function without the valuable resource. Whether it is the smartphone in your hand, the computer on your desk, the engine control system in your car, or the large data centers that power your shopping experiences, chips are silently ticking away at the center of nearly every modern day convenience.Therefore, it is not surprising that the semiconductor industry itself has lucrative future estimates. For instance, a research report by Allied Markets Research believes that the industry was already worth $555 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21% to sit at a whopping $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm states that this growth will be driven by the growth in consumer electronics, particularly due to the growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets spurred by the proliferation of fifth generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence are now playing a central role in how major companies operate throughout the globe, and their computational requirements are also expected to spur the demand for advanced semiconductors.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has an even more optimistic growth outlook for the chip sector. It estimates that the industry was worth $528 billion in 2021, and from then until 2029, it will grow at a strong CAGR of 12.2% to be worth $1.3 trillion by as early as 2029. Fortune Business concurs with Allied Markets in the belief that IoT will spur growth, but it goes on to add that China will be the fastest growing region as larger chunks of its population gain smartphone access. The Chinese market already accounted for half of the semiconductor revenue pie in 2021, as it generated $289 billion worth of sales.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take look at the largest semiconductor firms in the world. You're likely to have come across several of them, due to regular media coverage for companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co.

Experts anticipate a further 50 bps hike when the Federal Reserve meets in December.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Maryland-based aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with a global presence.The maker of the F-35 fighter has emerged as the biggest contract recipient with the US Department of Defense. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) received $39.2 billion worth of contracts from the Pentagon over the last year. Following the better-than-expected Q3 2022 results and an expanded share buyback plan, Peter J. Arment at Baird upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock from a Neutral to an Outperform rating while maintaining a target price of $513 on October 19.The analyst believes that the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows is still in place, and the strong buyback plan in a volatile market limits the downside potential of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Furthermore, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is expected to be a beneficiary of a ramped-up global defense expenditure at a time when tensions between global powers are high. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.48% as of December 5.Vltava Fund discussed its outlook on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company with a global footprint. The company claims that over 1.9 billion servings of its beverages are consumed across more than 200 countries every day.In a research note issued on October 26, Peter Grom at UBS maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and increased the price target from $63 to $68. The analyst termed the Q3 2022 results as strong and the increase in financial guidance as impressive. This was due to organic growth that was able to offset the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. The analyst believes that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) can trade at a premium against its peers due to the possibility of strong revenue growth in the upcoming quarters. This makes the risk and reward profile of the stock favorable for potential investors. Experts believe that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a price leadership position in the market and an advanced top-line growth management strategy that is expected to provide impetus to the top line. The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) annual dividend yield stands at 2.74% as of December 5.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, shared its stance on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the third biggest retailer in the world. The Issaquah, Washington-based company operates as a membership-only big box retailer with large warehouses.Analysts at Bank of America added Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock to the 'US 1 List' on November 22. The 'US 1 List' comprises the best investment ideas across all the sectors that are covered by the analysts at Bank of America. Experts believe that retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) will perform strongly through their low-priced private label brands as the consumer is trading down and buying fewer items. The holiday season is expected to provide a boost to the company due to higher consumer spending. Given the raging inflation, people will be looking for value, and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) falls under that category. Furthermore, the company’s membership program is also going strong as the annual renewal rate sits around the 90% mark. The stock's annual payout stands at $3.60, translating into a dividend yield of 0.68% as of December 5.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a Beaverton, Oregon-based company known for its footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment with a sports-based theme.

Experts believe that the company will continue to grow due to its globally renowned brand, out-of-the-box products, and high growth in emerging markets.Leaven Partners discussed its outlook on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”NIKE, Inc.

Experts believe that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is heading towards a favorable setup with the possibility of donanemab providing more upside in treating Alzheimer's. As of December 5, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has an annual forward dividend yield of 1.05%.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was discussed in the Q3 2022 investor letter of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“In the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Brunswick, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer goods company.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions.

Arment at Baird upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock from a Neutral to an Outperform rating while maintaining a target price of $513 on October 19.The analyst believes that the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows is still in place, and the strong buyback plan in a volatile market limits the downside potential of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).

Here’s what the firm said:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)10.

This was due to organic growth that was able to offset the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.

Here’s what the firm said:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the third biggest retailer in the world. The Issaquah, Washington-based company operates as a membership-only big box retailer with large warehouses.Analysts at Bank of America added Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock to the 'US 1 List' on November 22.

Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”NIKE, Inc.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics.

If you want to see more best Jim Cramer stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.Jim Cramer is a famous TV personality who hosts the show Mad Money. He is also an anchor on Squawk on the Street. Before TV, Jim Cramer ran a hedge fund, Cramer Berkowitz, that did pretty well. In its 14 years, his hedge fund averaged annual returns of 24%.In terms of his TV picks, Cramer hasn't been as successful as his hedge fund as he often recommends many different stocks across the stock market. As such, it's almost impossible for Cramer to be significantly above average. Investing successfully is more about swinging at good pitches rather than swinging at a ton of pitches. Nevertheless, Cramer can still be informative.In terms of his picks, Jim Cramer has recommended many different stocks. Given blue chips have historically performed better in the long term, this article will focus more on Jim Cramer's blue chip recommendations.In terms of Jim Cramer's recent commentary, he had the following comment about the market and his investing club, ""Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson says he has seen enough of the rally, and he says it’s time to bail. There’s less than 2% upside at the high end of his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 4,000 to 4,150. Stay with defensive stocks and utilities. The industrials have been carrying the market. I wrote about some of the hot old-school stocks lately and how we’re playing the sector for the Club.'2022 has been a volatile year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for many companies is lower than what it was before and broader market valuations have declined as capital has moved from equities to the Treasuries.Although inflation is showing signs of potentially peaking, many investors believe the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises rates too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a recession next year and the fundamentals of even blue chips could weaken. There could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations. As such, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that Jim Cramer has recommended before.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now10.

Although we lowered our exposure to this name, the stock continued its decline as we head into a European winter that will be very challenging for consumers. Both energy and food prices are elevated and there is no relief in sight. We are observing the situation closely but feel the stock more than adequately discounts this risk. The outlook for HAIN in 2023 could be much easier as winter ends and perhaps a political solution is reached in the Ukrainian War.

The initial treatment for patients with higher levels of PDL1 is Keytruda alone, and Mirati will likely begin planning next year for a combination study in those patients, Meek said.Recent study data shows that 19.4% of previously untreated, metastatic NSCLC patients treated with Keytruda plus chemotherapy were alive after five years, compared with 11.3% of patients treated with a placebo and chemotherapy.Adagrasib is an oral drug designed to target a mutated form of a gene known as KRAS that occurs in about 13% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease, and less frequently in some other solid tumors.Out of seven Phase 2 trial patients given the combination treatment, at a median follow-up of 19 months, four (57%) had tumor shrinkage of at least 30%, and none had tumor growth, Mirati said.A preliminary analysis of 53 patients showed that 49% of them had responded to the combination treatment, and 89% had controlled disease.Serious side effects occurred in 44% of patients, including increased levels of pancreatic enzymes in 11%, and higher liver enzymes in 8-9%. Mirati said the rates were consistent with levels seen when either drug is used on its own.Amgen Inc, which sells a KRAS-inhibitor called Lumakras, earlier this year said it had shelved immunotherapy combination studies after finding that high numbers of patients experienced liver toxicity.Story continuesMirati expects to hear by Dec. 14 on its application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval to sell adagrasib for treating patients with advanced NSCLC who have stopped responding to other drugs.Meek declined to comment on takeover speculation that has pushed shares of Mirati up nearly 40% since mid-November.""We're laser-focused on crossing the finish line with the approval and then we have to launch the drug ... We're so busy right now,"" he said. (Reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles Editing by Matthew Lewis )]"

The stock climbed by 7.7% resulting in a US$7.9b addition to the company’s market value. As a result, their original purchase of US$5.3m worth of stock is now worth US$5.9m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by President David Calhoun for US$4.0m worth of shares, at about US$160 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$185), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.Boeing insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeBoeing is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Boeing Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Boeing insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$4.2m for shares in the company -- and none sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Does Boeing Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Boeing insiders own about US$67m worth of shares. That equates to 0.06% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Boeing Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Boeing insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.Southern certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Southern peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Southern will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Southern's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Southern's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 12%. However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen an unpleasant 29% overall drop in EPS. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 10% each year as estimated by the twelve analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.0% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's curious that Southern's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.What We Can Learn From Southern's P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesOur examination of Southern's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   4 warning signs for Southern  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Northrop Grumman certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Northrop Grumman will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The P/E?Northrop Grumman's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 25% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 103% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 7.8% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.0% growth each year, that's a disappointing outcome.With this information, we find it concerning that Northrop Grumman is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of Northrop Grumman's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a poor outlook with earnings heading backwards, we suspect share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Having said that, be aware  Northrop Grumman is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of Northrop Grumman's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

The Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) the past four times to a range of 3.75% to 4%. Experts anticipate a further 50 bps hike when the Federal Reserve meets in December. Federal Reserve officials anticipate that the benchmark interest rate will peak around the 4.6% level over the next year. Meanwhile, some hawkish members of the Federal Reserve anticipate the interest rate to peak at around the 7% mark. Experts also believe that earnings could fall by 8% next year due to macroeconomic uncertainty.Amidst the bearish market momentum, it can be difficult to make investments in stocks with strong upside potential. Many analysts think that the quality of a stock can be gauged by its intrinsic value, returns, and earnings quality. However, there is no consensus on one particular basis to gauge quality. Some experts believe that price multiples like price-to-book (P/B) value, price-to-cash flow (P/CF), price-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (P/EBITDA), and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are sound measures to determine the quality of a stock. Furthermore, low volatility in the bottom line, high asset turnover and margins, low level of debt, and low-risk profile can also be considered indicators of high-quality stocks. In line with these metrics, companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are considered some of the best quality stocks in the market currently.11 Best Quality Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyStory continuesWe have shortlisted the 11 best quality stocks based on their business fundamentals and earnings quality.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Maryland-based aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with a global presence.The maker of the F-35 fighter has emerged as the biggest contract recipient with the US Department of Defense. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) received $39.2 billion worth of contracts from the Pentagon over the last year. Following the better-than-expected Q3 2022 results and an expanded share buyback plan, Peter J. Arment at Baird upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock from a Neutral to an Outperform rating while maintaining a target price of $513 on October 19.The analyst believes that the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows is still in place, and the strong buyback plan in a volatile market limits the downside potential of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Furthermore, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is expected to be a beneficiary of a ramped-up global defense expenditure at a time when tensions between global powers are high. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.48% as of December 5.Vltava Fund discussed its outlook on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company with a global footprint. The company claims that over 1.9 billion servings of its beverages are consumed across more than 200 countries every day.In a research note issued on October 26, Peter Grom at UBS maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and increased the price target from $63 to $68. The analyst termed the Q3 2022 results as strong and the increase in financial guidance as impressive. This was due to organic growth that was able to offset the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. The analyst believes that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) can trade at a premium against its peers due to the possibility of strong revenue growth in the upcoming quarters. This makes the risk and reward profile of the stock favorable for potential investors. Experts believe that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a price leadership position in the market and an advanced top-line growth management strategy that is expected to provide impetus to the top line. The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) annual dividend yield stands at 2.74% as of December 5.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, shared its stance on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the third biggest retailer in the world. The Issaquah, Washington-based company operates as a membership-only big box retailer with large warehouses.Analysts at Bank of America added Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock to the 'US 1 List' on November 22. The 'US 1 List' comprises the best investment ideas across all the sectors that are covered by the analysts at Bank of America. Experts believe that retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) will perform strongly through their low-priced private label brands as the consumer is trading down and buying fewer items. The holiday season is expected to provide a boost to the company due to higher consumer spending. Given the raging inflation, people will be looking for value, and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) falls under that category. Furthermore, the company’s membership program is also going strong as the annual renewal rate sits around the 90% mark. The stock's annual payout stands at $3.60, translating into a dividend yield of 0.68% as of December 5.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a Beaverton, Oregon-based company known for its footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment with a sports-based theme.

On October 13, Rick Patel at Raymond James initiated coverage on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) with an Outperform rating and a target price of $99. Although the stock is in the red YTD due to macroeconomic headwinds and industry-specific challenges, the analyst has a long-term bullish take on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Experts believe that the company will continue to grow due to its globally renowned brand, out-of-the-box products, and high growth in emerging markets.Leaven Partners discussed its outlook on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was held by 70 hedge funds at the end of Q3 2022.7.

Experts believe that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is heading towards a favorable setup with the possibility of donanemab providing more upside in treating Alzheimer's. As of December 5, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has an annual forward dividend yield of 1.05%.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was discussed in the Q3 2022 investor letter of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“In the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Brunswick, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer goods company. The company is focused on spinning off its consumer goods business as a separate publicly listed entity to focus more on the core pharmaceutical and medical devices segment.To provide impetus to the core business, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has announced the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions.

Shares off slightly today, but really not on this news. The bigger story coming out of the partnership side of its shoe business. Nike announcing today that it has mutually ended its relationship with Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving.This move comes about a month after Irving promoted an anti-Semitic film on Twitter. That resulted in an eight-game suspension from play on the court, but also resulted in a suspension from Nike. Nike suspended him back on November 4 and noted it wouldn't be releasing its latest shoe with the star, the Kyrie 8.So perhaps, Dave, the end of this saga for now. But I also think it gets to a larger story here about what we saw with Kanye and Adidas and these shoe companies that now everyone wants a Jordan, right? Nike obviously has Jordan. Adidas wanted their Jordan, and it didn't really work out so well. And Nike has sort of built out this brand where every shoe is attached to a player.DAVE BRIGGS: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: I'm wondering if we see a shift in that ever. Are they ever going to move away from--DAVE BRIGGS: Away from a player identification.JOSH SCHAFER: So then you don't lose the shoe. I saw a lot of people online today, they like hooping in the Kyries. They're wondering where that design is going.DAVE BRIGGS: How does he move the needle, though, has always been my question because when you listen to the initial words of Phil Knight, there was no question. He was gone. Phil Knight was ticked off, and he wasn't going to resolve that. But my impression is he doesn't move the needle the way Nike would prefer, and it's not worth the cash.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, no, I think that's fair.DAVE BRIGGS: 11 million a year.JOSH SCHAFER: 11 million a year. But what player does? I just feel like they signed so many deals now with different players. Is it worth only having one player?Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: True.JOSH SCHAFER: There's one LeBron in the league right now, right? There's one LeBron.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: So maybe you just have LeBron, and you wait for the next Jordan. You wait for the next LeBron. And you don't attach yourself to so many different players. So then you don't lose the shoe design.DAVE BRIGGS: Interesting, interesting theory. We're going to have to discuss that further. I think they still love that model. By the way, the Amazon film that he tweeted out still there. Jassy says, not going away.

If you want to see more best Jim Cramer stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.Jim Cramer is a famous TV personality who hosts the show Mad Money. He is also an anchor on Squawk on the Street. Before TV, Jim Cramer ran a hedge fund, Cramer Berkowitz, that did pretty well. In its 14 years, his hedge fund averaged annual returns of 24%.In terms of his TV picks, Cramer hasn't been as successful as his hedge fund as he often recommends many different stocks across the stock market. As such, it's almost impossible for Cramer to be significantly above average. Investing successfully is more about swinging at good pitches rather than swinging at a ton of pitches. Nevertheless, Cramer can still be informative.In terms of his picks, Jim Cramer has recommended many different stocks. Given blue chips have historically performed better in the long term, this article will focus more on Jim Cramer's blue chip recommendations.In terms of Jim Cramer's recent commentary, he had the following comment about the market and his investing club, ""Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson says he has seen enough of the rally, and he says it’s time to bail. There’s less than 2% upside at the high end of his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 4,000 to 4,150. Stay with defensive stocks and utilities. The industrials have been carrying the market. I wrote about some of the hot old-school stocks lately and how we’re playing the sector for the Club.'2022 has been a volatile year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for many companies is lower than what it was before and broader market valuations have declined as capital has moved from equities to the Treasuries.Although inflation is showing signs of potentially peaking, many investors believe the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises rates too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a recession next year and the fundamentals of even blue chips could weaken. There could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations. As such, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that Jim Cramer has recommended before.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now10.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 486.34 points, or 1.41%, to 33,943.54.In other economic data this week, investors will also monitor weekly jobless claims, producer prices and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for more clues on the health of the U.S. economy.Energy was among the biggest S&amp;P sectoral losers. It was weighed by U.S. natural gas futures slumping more than 10% on Monday, as the outlook dimmed due to forecasts for milder weather and the delayed restart of the Freeport liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant.EQT Corp, one of the largest U.S. natural gas producers, saw one of the most dramatic falls.Financials were also hit hard. Although bank profits are typically boosted by rising interest rates, they are also sensitive to concerns about bad loans or slowing loan growth amid an economic downturn.Meanwhile, apparel maker VF Corp dropped after announcing the sudden retirement of CEO Steve Rendle. The firm, which owns names including outdoor wear brand The North Face and sneaker maker Vans, also cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts, blaming weaker-than-anticipated consumer demand.

For a brand that grew from about $300 million VF acquired it in 2004 to more than $4.1 billion last year, that’s a problem.It seems to have been a big enough problem to help push president, chairman and chief executive officer Steve Rendle to “retire,” leaving the board searching for a permanent successor to lead the company forward.That successor will inherit a Vans that’s on the move.Global chief marketing officer Kristin Harrer, who joined Vans last year from Dollar Shave Club and is part of the team tasked with turning the business around, told WWD in an interview last month that the brand is ready to tap into a new kind of creativity in its customer base.Harrer said Vans’ core — its DNA — hadn’t been updated in seven to 10 years and how it articulated who its consumer muse was had stayed the same for five years.That’s at least half a lifetime for a young customer base — and more given the tectonic shifts of the pandemic.“When I came in, I was like, ‘All right, let’s take a pause,’” said Harrer, who was hired without meeting her colleagues in person and worked the first six months remotely as the world worked through COVID-19. “Let’s gather the strategy teams, the insights digital team and the marketing team, and go back into the marketplace globally, not just in the U.S. but in all the markets that matter to us and figure out where the consumer’s at.”Story continuesThat was a mission that, while important for any brand, was vital for Vans.Kevin Bailey, who returned to Vans this year, taking the reins as global brand president and responsibility for the turnaround, singled out the brand’s disconnect from its consumer as a key issue during a September meeting with analysts.“We, at the brand, failed to adequately monitor and swiftly and effectively adapt to the changes we need to make and the changes that were going on in our environment,” Bailey said. “That’s unacceptable for a youth culture brand. We missed some market and consumer signals, and with our significant growth, we became complacent to the changes we needed to make.”Vans — which is driven by sneakers and has a small apparel business — became overly reliant on its core canvas classic styles and needed to innovate more, he said.The brand has long sought to connect with its customers through the notion of creativity, and will continue to do so, but Harrer said the emphasis has changed and that will become more apparent in its marketing.“Creativity and how consumers think about creativity has shifted,” she said.Kristin HarrerVans’ mission had been to fuel self-expression and the act of creating — whether that be performing on stage or a skateboard or painting or something else.Harrer said that while that message “speaks deeply to a creative community, it also leaves a lot of people out.”When Vans went to its customer base it found a new kind of relationship to creativity.“Instagram’s here to stay,” Harrer said. “There is a certain performative culture that exists that they have to participate in. But the deeper kind of human yearning underneath all of that is they wish they could kind of push that aside and use their own creativity to fuel themselves.”That has Vans focusing on skate and surf and the rest of its action sport base, yes, but also on personal narratives of self discovery.“The way that we’re articulating it now is less about the act of creative self-expression and doing something creative and more about going on a journey that leverages creativity to help you discover who you are,” she said.This kind of deep thinking on creativity is more necessary today with more consumer brands getting in on the game.“If creativity is a pie, we really had to figure out, ‘What part of that creativity pie does Vans own?’” Harrer said. “Because TikTok now owns a part of it and Apple owns a part of it. And there’s so many brands that…own pieces of it.“If we define ourselves by creativity, we had to make it a little bit sharper,” she said. “So it is about this idea of going on a journey of self-discovery and that’s where we’re gonna push hard in the future. It’ll be storytelling that’s less about what’d you make and more about who are you. And so really trying to intentionally connect to a broader swath of people.“Not everybody’s going to be able to innately connect to a painter and somebody who puts something on a canvas,” she said. “But you can connect to someone’s journey, a lot more people can connect to that.”It’s a plan to go big that is both necessary if the brand is going to charge through the $5 billion mark and key to the company’s future.VF has The North Face, Supreme, Timberland and other brands as well, but right now, it needs the Vans business to work.“There’s real concern about the capital structure at this point,” said John Kernan, an analyst at Cowen, who noted the company will likely have to refinance debt coming due next year at much higher interest rates.“For equity holders that are really in this for the dividend, I think there’s some concern about putting more leverage on the balance sheet,” Kernan said.A growing Vans would help ease some worries, so the brand is under the microscope.Kernan said he watches Vans closely, through web traffic and by other means.“There’s clearly not been a turn in the data,” he said.To hit its goals, the brand is going to have to keep growing globally while also building its offering.“Apparel is clearly part of the long-term growth trajectory,” Kernan said. “I think they need it to be able to get to the $6 billion top-line run rate that they’ve spoken about in the past.”Marketing is just one piece of the puzzle; the brand is also tweaking its operating structure to be better aligned with a bigger business and making other changes.It’s worth remembering that, while the brand has taken a step back, it also raced ahead for a long time.“Vans just went through this hyper growth phase and I think the competitive environment just caught up to them, peers caught up to them, they didn’t innovate enough,” Kernan said. “There wasn’t a lot of newness. They hit a fashion trend and they rode it very well at the time.”Now the brand just has to get back into the groove — and VF’s future CEO, whomever it might be, will be tasked with making sure it gets there.]"

And Wall Street doesn’t approve.Shares of the company fell 10.8 percent to $29.65 in midday trading on Monday and are down more than 50 percent over the past year.“The last couple of years have been really challenging,” said Tom Nikic, an analyst covering VF for Wedbush Securities Inc. “[Rendle] stepped into the CEO role right when Vans was the hottest brand in the world and they were just flying high and everything was going great. Now you’ve had this situation where the recovery from COVID-19 has been far softer than they expected.“Steve came up through The North Face and he was a North Face guy, it’s probably not a surprise that North Face is the best-performing brand in the portfolio right now,” Nikic said. “But Vans is the biggest brand. As Vans goes, this company goes, this stock goes.”Story continuesThe analyst described Timberland as a “roller coaster” and said investors aren’t seeing the kind of consistency in VF that they’re used to.And the company’s latest addition might have left it in something of a tough spot.A look at the Stone Island/Supreme collection.“The Supreme acquisition probably hasn’t worked out the way they thought,” Nikic said. “They had to put a lot of debt on the balance sheet to fund the Supreme acquisition. Right now they’re probably rueing that. That’s one move they wish they could take back would be my guess. They paid [more than] $2 billion for a brand that generates $500 million in revenue.”(VF has also been lauded for not forcing the scarcity-dependent Supreme to be more commercial, keeping the brand purer as it grows into its potential, but that might not come soon enough to help the firm out of its current jam.)Nikic noted that with $5.5 billion of net debt and a $876 million tax payment tied to the Timberland acquisition, VF’s dividend could be at risk unless the company refinances at less-favorable terms next year.That leaves VF with a tricky stretch ahead.Lead independent director Benno Dorer on Monday was named interim president and CEO, putting the company in the hands of a consumer products veteran who was CEO of Clorox for six years and is now a senior adviser with private equity giant KKR &amp; Co. Inc. Richard Carucci, VF director and former Yum! Brands Inc. executive, will serve as interim chairman of the board.A search is underway for a permanent CEO and the company said internal and external candidates will be evaluated.It could be a tough spot to fill — and there are other big companies looking for a new CEO, including Under Armour Inc., Gap Inc. and Kohl’s Corp. after that retailer’s CEO, Michelle Gass, revealed plans to decamp to Levi Strauss &amp; Co., where she eventually will succeed its CEO Chip Bergh.Surely there would be plenty of takers for the top job at VF, but there are fewer contenders today with a fashion background, international experience and practice running a large multibrand portfolio.“Complexity as well as change in hyper drive has severely affected those in the C-suite as we have seen with the exit of Michele Gass from Kohl’s and now Steve Rendle from VF,” said Elaine Hughes, CEO of executive search firm E.A. Hughes, a division of Solomon Page.For VF, Hughes said: “Multibrand navigation is critical and unfortunately there are mostly executives with single brand responsibility with the exception of cosmetics. The [consumer packaged goods] industry could possibly deliver some interesting candidates as Ralph Lauren Corp. has seen with the hire of Patrice Louvet, and Gina Boswell at Bath &amp; Body Works. Another trend is the boomerang executive, not just Bob Iger returning to Disney, but Mary Dillon at Foot Locker and Ken Hicks at Academy.”For now, it’s up to Dorer.“The board thanks Steve for his many contributions and leadership during his nearly six years as CEO and nearly 25 years with VF,” Dorer said. “Steve’s commitment to the business, passion for building strong brands and focus on culture have helped VF evolve our portfolio of strong active-lifestyle brands and establish VF as a purpose-led company. We wish Steve well in his future endeavors.“VF has iconic brands in attractive growth categories, deep relationships with consumers and customers, and significant competitive advantages as a portfolio company,” the interim CEO said. “I look forward to working closely with the board and VF’s executive leadership team to drive profitable growth across our portfolio while the board identifies the right leader for the company’s next chapter.”The last chapter was certainly a busy one.Rendle moved the company’s headquarters to Denver, spun off Lee and Wrangler into Kontoor Brands Inc. to focus on the outdoor space, navigated the pandemic and bought Supreme.“It has been an honor to lead VF as CEO over the last five years,” Rendle said. “I depart with the deepest gratitude for the extremely talented and dedicated global team at VF. I remain as confident as ever in VF’s tremendous potential and look forward to watching the company’s continued success.”]"

It is given as three injections in the upper arm, with the first two doses given three weeks apart, followed by a third dose administered at least two months after the second dose.U.S. officials rolled out this version of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot for thesame age groupearlier this year.

We look forward to working with Pfizer, a global leader in antiviral development, to advance a new class of oral antivirals for COVID-19.""Story continuesUnder the terms of the agreement, the two companies will work together to identify a PLpro candidate to progress into the clinic, at which time Pfizer will be solely responsible for further development and commercialization activities. Clear Creek Bio will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and will be eligible to receive additional potential milestone payments plus royalties on future product sales.About SARS-CoV-2 PLproSARS-CoV-2 has two essential proteases, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro), both required to fully process the viral polyprotein and assemble a functional replicase complex. In addition to its critical role in viral replication, the PLpro also contributes to dysregulation of host innate immunity and immune evasion.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

203,efa3e12f-2232-3236-882e-2e3a36b7c1b9,PFE,2022-12-06,Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) investors will be pleased with their notable 77% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizers-nyse-pfe-investors-pleased-110148891.html,1670324508,STORY,['PFE'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 40% over five years, which is below the market return. But if you include dividends then the return is market-beating. Unfortunately the share price is down 1.5% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Pfizer To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Pfizer achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 27% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 9.51 also suggests market apprehension.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Pfizer has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Pfizer, it has a TSR of 77% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Pfizer shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.7% over one year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 12% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Pfizer has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But note: Pfizer may not be the best stock to buy.

Investors may be wondering if these stocks will continue to be strong investments going into 2023.Taking a look at the outlook and valuation of these two pharmaceutical stocks will give a better answer to this question.Recent Performance Before we dive into growth prospects and value let’s take a look at the recent performance of Pfizer and Moderna.Pfizer is down -14% YTD to slightly outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -16% and beat Moderna’s -31%. Over the last three years to cover the pandemic timeframe, MRNA is up +820% to crush PFE and the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizer and Moderna stocks are gaining nice momentum as we close out the year. In fact, in the last three months, MRNA is up +34% Vs. PFE’s +11%. Both pharmaceutical stocks have outperformed broader indexes during this stretch.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation &amp; Growth Outlook Pfizer and Moderna stock both carry an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. Trading around $50 per share and roughly 18% from its highs, PFE has a forward P/E of 7.8X. In comparison, MRNA trades 45% off its high at $176 a share and 8.49X forward earnings.Both stocks look attractive relative to their past. Moderna had its IPO in 2018 with the stock trading nicely below its historic high of 18.9X. When comparing this period, Pfizer also trades solidly beneath its high of 15.7X.Pivoting to growth, Pfizer’s earnings are now expected to climb 46% to $6.46 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 EPS is projected to drop -25% to $4.85 following a strong year for PFE’s bottom line attributed to its covid-boosted growth. Earnings estimate revisions have declined for both FY22 and FY23 over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Sales are projected to pop 23% this year and decline -23% in FY23 to $76.99 billion. Still, FY23 sales would represent 49% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $51.75 billion.Story continuesLooking at Moderna, earnings are forecasted to decline -24% this year to $21.48 per share after an excellent FY21. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to drop another -78% to $4.58 a share as MRNA’s EPS continues to its post-pandemic reality.Earnings estimates for FY22 and FY23 revisions have declined over the last quarter as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn its top line, Moderna’s sales are now projected to rise 4% this year but drop -52% in FY23 to $9.19 billion. This is still a staggering 15,217% increase from 2019 pre-pandemic sales.Bottom LinePfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While earnings estimate revisions are down in FY22 for PFE and MRNA they still trade attractively relative to their past. The growth in both companies continues to be impressive from pre-pandemic levels and investors may be rewarded for holding these stocks at current levels. It is always interesting to compare these vaccine makers’ financial metrics and performance but investors should be mindful that they are unique companies in different stages of corporate life. Pfizer is a health giant with a diverse drug pipeline that should recover in a post-covid-vaccine world while Moderna still has to prove itself and its mRNA-based therapies.To that note, PFE offers investors a respectable 3.14% annual dividend yield while MRNA doesn’t have a dividend at the moment but the price performance of the stock has edged Pfizer.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let’s take a deeper dive into all three.Eli Lilly and CompanyEli Lilly is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, boasting a diversified product profile that includes a solid lineup of new successful drugs.LLY’s annual dividend currently yields 1.1%, below that of its Zacks Medical sector average. Still, the company’s 14.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLLY has primarily posted better-than-expected earnings as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in two of its last three quarters. In its latest release, the company registered a slight 0.5% EPS beat paired with a 0.4% sales surprise.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbVieAbbVie is a global research-based biopharmaceutical company that delivers innovative medicines, becoming one of the top-most pharma companies after it acquired Botox maker Allergan in a cash-and-stock deal for $63 billion in May 2020.Story continuesUndoubtedly a major positive, AbbVie is a member of the elite Dividend King group. The company’s annual dividend currently yields an impressive 3.4% paired with a rock-solid 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company’s free cash flow growth is hard to ignore; in its latest release, AbbVie reported free cash flow of $7.4 billion, reflecting a 52% sequential increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizerPfizer is a multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered in New York City, well-known for its COVID-19 vaccine.PFE’s dividend metrics would please any income-focused investor; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 3.1% paired with a 4.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Further, the company’s 25% payout ratio is very sustainable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPFE has also posted strong quarterly results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back releases.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Media Stocks To Buy Now.Over the past few years, the media industry has undergone a fair amount of change. One major trend observed, particularly post-pandemic, is that of a growing interest in the streaming video industry. As a result, traditional media in the form of newspapers, TV channels, and more is beginning to be replaced by online streaming. With the rise of the streaming video industry, media producers are beginning to face overwhelming pressure to keep producing engaging content and get it in front of their target audiences. According to a Deloitte report on the media sector’s outlook for 2022, in the US, the rate at which people add and cancel paid streaming services averaged around 35% in 2022. This rate of subscription churn is only one factor pressuring media producers to keep putting out hit content and stay on top of their game in an ever-evolving industry.Traditional media companies like Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. Series A (NASDAQ:WBD) and Paramount Global Class B (NASDAQ:PARA), alongside newer, less conventional media companies such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), are finding themselves embroiled in this new and transformative sector. However, these companies are also finding themselves in a better position in the media industry due to global conditions improving. According to a PwC report on the Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook for 2022-2026, the entertainment and media industry has seen an improvement from its contraction in 2020 to resume its growth path. Revenues for the industry rose by 10.4% in 2021. Additionally, the report forecasts that by 2026, the entertainment and media industry will also approach about $3 trillion in revenues.The report envisions the media industry to be a $2.9 trillion market by 2026, one that is more digital, mobile, and pitched at media targeting the younger generations. Between 2022 and 2026, the industry’s revenue is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. Additionally, the report observed a pattern of growing digitization of the entertainment and media industry, a trend that can mean greater profitability for the industry as it works to fit into a newer, more tech-savvy market. In 2021, advertising grew by 22.6%, representing a 32.3% growth in total industry revenues. This growth is largely fed by digital advertisements and their growing popularity within the media industry.Story continuesLet’s now take a look at the 12 best media stocks to buy now.Photo by Myke Simon on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected traditional and new media stocks for our list below, based on a range of factors representing their growth potential.

ARHS, Perion Network PERI, HF Sinclair DINO, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Aercap AER.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.Story continuesThere are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20-Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold), offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Arhaus: Arhaus is a rapidly growing lifestyle brand and omni-channel retailer of premium home furnishings. Arhaus offers an exclusive range of heirloom quality products that are sustainably sourced, lovingly made, and built to last.

This represents an annual dividend yield of 2.3% based on its share price worth as of Dec 2, 2022.The annual dividend yield is more than the industry’s yield of 3.13% but lower than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s yield of 1.53%.Will AES Sustain Dividend Hikes?AES Corporation has been consistently paying out dividends to its shareholders, buoyed by its ability to generate cash flow and a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. In the first nine months of 2022, the company paid out a total dividend of $316 million compared with $301 million in the nine months of 2021. This reflects its focus on increasing shareholder worth.Moreover, such a distribution strategy is backed by its ability to generate strong free cash flow and earnings from its operations. In this regard, the company expects a 7% to 9% annualized growth target for the adjusted EPS and free cash flow through 2025.Further, the strong backlog of 11,230 megawatts should assist the company in attaining a steady inflow of cash in the business to support shareholders’ return. AES Corp. is also working to expand its operation in the liquefied natural gas market. This will allow the company to generate strong income in the long term.AES targets to have $6.3 billion in discretionary cash through 2022-2025, out of which the company strives to distribute $2.03 billion in dividends, reflecting its solid capital allocation and distribution strategy. The solid cash flow position will allow the company to hike dividends in the long haul.Peer MovesA company’s ability to return excess cash to shareholders reflects financial strength in the business and an effective capital deployment strategy. In this context, apart from AES Corporation, utilities that have rewarded shareholders with dividends are as follows:Story continuesIn October 2022, American Electric Power Company AEP increased its dividend by 5 cents per share to 83 cents per share.

But it just might be the ideal time to invest in the airlines. Shares of United taking off earlier today on an upgrade from Morgan Stanley to overweight. They have since come back down to Earth, but still a pretty solid day to start this week.On that news, analyst Ravi Shankar writing, ""UAL seems on track to exceed its 2023 guidance and hit its 2026 guide issued 18 months ago, something even the biggest UAL bulls may have considered difficult at the time."" Seana, Stanley Morgan sees 2023 as the Goldilocks sweet spot, no longer too hot, no longer too cold, just right. What do you think?- I think it makes sense when you take a look at the travel trends of what we were seeing in terms of the pent up demand. The travel levels, the TSA numbers look very strong. We had been expecting it. But when you compare this past weekend to what we saw in 2019, we actually exceeded 2019 levels on Saturday. So those levels have really returned to what we were seeing pre-pandemic, obviously a bullish sign here for the airlines.I also think it was interesting within that note from Morgan Stanley what they said about the low-cost carriers. They said now while they are up against some pretty tough comps compared to last year-- that's why they did downgrade Allegiant Air to equal weight from overweight-- they are pretty bullish, given the pent up demand that they are seeing from those low cost carriers and the fact that it's so expensive to fly right now. More and more people are trading down to those lower cost carriers.- It is brutal. And it's interesting. Until this note, I hadn't realized how much UAL had outperformed its rivals, still down around 2% year to date, but that's given Delta down about 10%, Southwest down about 46%, JetBlue-- excuse me-- 10%, JetBlue down 46%, American down 25%, so dramatically outperforming all of its rivals.Story continuesAnd look, when you look at the year 2023-2024, it seems like, feels like a new norm. I think people are still talking about revenge travel. That's not what it seems like out there. It seems like people have just shifted priority to spending now on experiences, on travel, rather than on goods. I think it's a new norm we're entering. Plus supply chains appear to be clearing up. That was a big headwind for the airlines last year. And it appears that pilot shortage is beginning to at least clear up. And now you see Delta with that major new deal for its pilots.- A major new deal. That's going to be interesting to track, whether or not it is fully approved. That could really set the stage and the standard for some of the other negotiations that are still going on from some of those other larger carriers.- Well, because Delta has a provision that says they'll always make 1% higher than their two chief rivals. So how will the others step up and match that?- We will see.]"

Dow Jones Industrial Average, that's down by about 8/10 of a percent right now, 270 points in the red.

We'll go there, and then we'll come back to this other board that I have set up for us and our convenience. We've actually got just one leader on the day right now. That is communication services. That's flat, just barely to the upside.However, bringing up the caboose on the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors, you've got consumer discretionary, down by about 1.8%. And then, also, yeah, you've got a little bit of financial movement lower here by about 1.4%. But getting back to some of those travel names that I had pulled up a moment ago, and particularly on one call from Morgan Stanley saying that 2023 may be a Goldilocks year for travel, that kind of echoes some of the sentiment that we've heard from some of the other travel CEOs that have talked about, in Hilton's case, a golden age of travel that we may be entering into-- or, even from the airline front, what they've been seeing in surging travel demand.UAL is up on that call from Morgan Stanley. We're seeing that up by about 1.4%, as well as some of the other airlines names holding on to some gains, at least right now. So we'll continue to watch that.]"

232,91c0e38c-3144-3119-b4ef-233d47bc910e,UAL,2022-12-06,Fast-paced Momentum Stock United (UAL) Is Still Trading at a Bargain,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fast-paced-momentum-stock-united-135001442.html,1670248201,STORY,['UAL'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.United Airlines (UAL) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 3% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this airline well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 11.8% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for UAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.33. This indicates that the stock moves 33% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that UAL has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UAL earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UAL is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UAL is currently trading at 0.35 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 35 cents for each dollar of sales.So, UAL appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to UAL, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this retailer have returned +2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +8.6% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has gained 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, indicating a change of -51.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -53.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -57.9%. This estimate has changed -29.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.93 indicates a change of +73.9% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -18.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Target.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $30.86 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.5%. The $108.56 billion and $112 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.4% and +3.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. EPS of $1.54 for the same period compares with $3.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was -28.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

238,2c3718b2-0232-30c9-bcd5-38006289d8ef,CSX,2022-12-06,CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-nasdaq-csx-experiencing-growth-120131124.html,1670328091,STORY,['CSX'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) so let's look a bit deeper.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for CSX:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$5.8b ÷ (US$42b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, CSX has an ROCE of 15%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for CSX roceIn the above chart we have measured CSX's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsCSX has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 31% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Our Take On CSX's ROCETo bring it all together, CSX has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 76% return over the last five years. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if CSX can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with CSX and understanding this should be part of your investment process.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

239,73a7195e-9b39-3597-82ab-e353a4d3381d,CSX,2022-12-06,Biden's Intervention Averts Rail Strike: An Analysis,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bidens-intervention-averts-rail-strike-172505913.html,1670261105,STORY,"['CSX', 'UNP']","[On Dec 2, President Joe Biden signed the resolution to avoid a rail strike, thereby bringing relief to the U.S. economy, which is already reeling under high inflation and supply chain issues. Unions and railroad companies like Union Pacific UNP, CSX Corporation CSX and Norfolk Southern NSC had time till Dec 9 to iron out differences and reach an agreement to avoid a strike. With the President signing the bill that would make a rail strike illegal, that damaging possibility has been put to rest.All the abovementioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We remind investors that stocks in the railroad space have been hitherto hit hard by headwinds like supply-chain woes, labor woes and high fuel costs. Due to supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity, overall volumes declined 2% year over year at Norfolk Southern in third-quarter 2022.While releasing the third-quarter 2022 results, management at Union Pacific trimmed its carload growth (volumes) outlook for the current year to around 3% from the 4-5% band expected earlier. The high inflation-induced rise in interest rates, which may lead to an economic slowdown, resulted in the outlook cut. Also, now UNP expects 2022 operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) to be around 60%. Earlier the expectation was for the ratio to be around 58%. Lower the ratio, the better. The unfavorable forecast can be attributed to economic uncertainty. Supply-chain woes and escalated expenses on fuel also resulted in the deterioration of the operating ratio at another railroad operator — CSX Corporation — in the September quarter.If thestrike had materialized, the supply-chain woes would have been further aggravated, in turn, dealing a huge blow to customers already suffering from sky-high inflation. A nationwide railroad strike would have hit the economy very hard. The work stoppage by railroad workers was estimated to have cost the already fragile economy more than $2 billion a day.No wonder, the President was a relieved man, before signing the bill he said, “The bill I’m about to sign ends a difficult rail dispute and helps our nation avoid what, without a doubt, would have been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar.”Story continuesWith the damaging strike being averted let’s have a look back and recapture the related events.A strike by U.S. railroad workers had been looming large ever since workers at the largest rail union in the United States voted against a provisional deal reached in September this year. The rejection was due to the absence of a clause pertaining to granting of paid sick leave to workers in the railroad industry. The deal, however, included 24% compounded wage hike over the 2020-2024 period and five annual lump sum payments amounting to $1,000, per a Reuters report.With the specter of a rail strike looming, that would cripple the economy, the President intervened to thwart that damaging possibility. Accordingly, the House voted 290 to 137 on Nov 30 for imposing the tentative deal reached in September. The same was passed by the Senate (80-15) a day later. Following approval by the House and the Senate, the President signed the legislation to block the rail strike. However, the Senate failed to approve a measure pertaining to paid sick leave.What’s Ahead?While it is clear that there will be no rail strike, the fact remains that the major area of dispute – regarding paid sick leaves, is still unresolved. However, on the contentious issue, the President has said ""That fight isn't over."" While unions demand the presence of paid sick leave, railroad companies like UNP, CSX and NSC are totally opposed to the inclusion of the clause as it would increase their labor costs, Given this backdrop. we expect investors to follow the updates on this burning issue in the coming days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s fiscal third-quarter gross profit margin was 29.1%, down 0.4 percentage points. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that for modeling purposes, it is currently projecting nearly 130 bps of incremental freight expense and 70 bps of additional wage costs for fiscal 2023.Nevertheless, we believe that the aforementioned upsides will likely help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stay afloat amid such hurdles.TJX’s stock has increased 27.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 5.7% growth.3 Hot Retail BetsHere we have highlighted three top-ranked stocks, namely Ross Stores Inc.

Whether it is the smartphone in your hand, the computer on your desk, the engine control system in your car, or the large data centers that power your shopping experiences, chips are silently ticking away at the center of nearly every modern day convenience.Therefore, it is not surprising that the semiconductor industry itself has lucrative future estimates. For instance, a research report by Allied Markets Research believes that the industry was already worth $555 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21% to sit at a whopping $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm states that this growth will be driven by the growth in consumer electronics, particularly due to the growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets spurred by the proliferation of fifth generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence are now playing a central role in how major companies operate throughout the globe, and their computational requirements are also expected to spur the demand for advanced semiconductors.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has an even more optimistic growth outlook for the chip sector. It estimates that the industry was worth $528 billion in 2021, and from then until 2029, it will grow at a strong CAGR of 12.2% to be worth $1.3 trillion by as early as 2029. Fortune Business concurs with Allied Markets in the belief that IoT will spur growth, but it goes on to add that China will be the fastest growing region as larger chunks of its population gain smartphone access. The Chinese market already accounted for half of the semiconductor revenue pie in 2021, as it generated $289 billion worth of sales.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take look at the largest semiconductor firms in the world. You're likely to have come across several of them, due to regular media coverage for companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co.

FCX, Southern Copper Corp. SCCO and First Quantum Minerals FQVLF.Industry: Non-Ferrous MetalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2025172/3-non-ferrous-metal-mining-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak as apprehensions about slowing demand and economic activity have been weighing down commodity prices. Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy as well as labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Southern Copper Corp. and First Quantum Minerals. These are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process.Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit followed by assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly precede actual mining. The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of an Economic Slowdown Weighing on Commodity Prices: Copper prices have declined for most part of this year due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession.Story continuesSilver prices have also been negatively impacted this year, thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Gold prices also felt the pressure of a rallying dollar and Treasury yields. However, recently, metal prices have found support amid expectations of a pickup in industrial demand as Fed Chair Powell signaled that the central bank may slow the pace of rate hikes this month. Concerns of low supply are also aiding prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues.Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternative energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance: The industry players are currently dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future given their wide usage in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials.Demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy are expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals. While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 19% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of this year, the industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 38%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 7.1% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector growth of 1.8%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 12.8% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 4.95X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.03X.

It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in an incremental annual production of around 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum.Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves.  It is assessing a large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci also increased milling rates. The Lone Star project in eastern Arizona has been completed and is on track to produce more than 200 million pounds of copper annually.The company is looking to advance studies for potential expansions and long-term development options for its large-scale sulfide resources at Lone Star. It is also ramping up underground production at Grasberg in Indonesia, resulting in a spike in milling rates. Focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable. Shares of FCX have gained 7.6% over the past year.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCX’s earnings for 2023 indicates year-over-year growth of 0.6%.

Its constant focus on increasing low-cost production is commendable.SCCO expects copper production in 2023 to reach 926,000 tons, with the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista. It will gain from its efforts to grow in Peru, given that the country is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves.Peru’s national output is anticipated grow to 206,999 by next year. Southern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion. Michiquillay is expected to become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will produce 225,000 tons of copper per year (along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver) for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash-cost. The company's shares have gained 5.4% in the past year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Phoenix, AZ-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 7% over the past 30 days. The company, which engages in mining, exploring, smelting, and refining copper and other minerals, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.First Quantum Minerals: The company’s platform of cash generating and geographically diversified operating assets poises it well for growth. Focus on operational improvements has resulted in strong production from Cobre Panama and Sentinel in the last reported quarter.The company recently signed a long-term renewable power contract for the CP100 Expansion project at Cobre Panama, which shifts the total energy mix at the mine to approximately 20% renewable by the end of 2023, marking an important step toward achieving its target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. FQVLF foresees 1 million tons of annual copper production through its organic brownfield opportunities.At Cobre Panama, the CP100 Expansion seems to be on track to add 100 million tons by the end of 2023. At Kansanshi mine, the ongoing S3 Expansion project will boost production and extend the mine life for two more decades. First ore production is expected at the Enterprise project in the first half of 2023. It is a low-cost, high-grade nickel sulfideproject with annual nickel production of 30 thousand tons over an 11-year mine life. The company's shares have gained 10.3% in the past year.Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, First Quantum Minerals is a global mining company primarily producing copper, with secondary production in gold, nickel, zinc and cobalt. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has moved north by 423% over the past 30 days to $1.39 per share. The estimate projects year-over-year growth of 36%.

While the Fed has flagged smaller rate hikes in the coming months, the central bank also warned that rates could peak at much higher-than-expected levels.Such a scenario would be negative for most non-yielding assets, with gold likely to be impacted the most. The central bank is now set to meet next week in its last meeting for 2022.Spot gold was flat around $1,769.30 an ounce, while gold futures were steady at $1,781.55 an ounce. Both instruments tumbled around 1.7% on Monday, their worst day in nearly three months.Rising interest rates were the biggest weight on bullion prices this year, as higher yields on debt pushed up the opportunity cost of holding gold. While the yellow metal has recovered from lows hit earlier this year, its outlook remains constrained by uncertainty over the path of U.S. interest rates.Other precious metals were also subdued on Tuesday after falling sharply in the prior session. Platinum futures fell 0.1%, while silver futures were flat around $22.422 an ounce. Both metals plunged 2.4% and 4.4% on Monday respectively.Among industrial metals, copper prices reversed early gains on Monday as fears of higher interest rates largely offset optimism over a potential recovery in Chinese demand.Copper futures were flat around $3.7900 a pound after plummeting 2% in the prior session.Story continuesWhile the red metal marked a strong recovery over the past two weeks on growing optimism over the withdrawal of anti-COVID measures in China, fears that higher interest rates will further stymie economic activity appeared to have cut short the recovery.China has still given no signal that it will scale back the entirety of its zero-COVID policy, having so far scaled back only select measures in its major cities.Related ArticlesGold slumps below $1,800 as Fed fears resurfaceOil rises on China optimism after steep drop, but Fed fears persistOil prices rise after price cap on Russian crude, OPEC+ meeting]"

Investments don’t have to be limited to traditional stocks and bonds, sometimes the most valuable investments are the tangible goods that are all around us—these are called commodities.What are commodities? Commodities are an asset class made up of raw materials used to make consumer goods. These materials can help diversify an investor's mix of assets and spread risk across different asset types.“A commodity is a good or service whose wide availability diminishes the importance of factors other than price (such as brand name, uniqueness, or appeal) in determining its value,"" says Thomas Samuelson, CFA, CMT, and chief investment officer at Vineyard Global Advisors. ""A commodity is fungible, in that there is typically little differentiation between supply from different sources.”Some of the most common commodities to invest in typically fall into one of the following categories:Agricultural: This type of commodity usually includes goods like coffee, corn, sugar, soybeans, and wheat. These crops are commonly used in popular consumer products and can be a source of food for humans and livestock as well.Energy: Energy commodities include crude oil used to fuel transportations and the production of plastics, natural gas used for electricity, and gasoline, which powers personal vehicles.Metals: Metals include gold, used in making jewelry; silver, also used for jewelry and many other industrial uses as well; and copper, the most widely used form of electrical wiring.Livestock: [hotlink]Popular[/hotlink] livestock like cattle and hogs are considered commodities.How do you invest in commodities?There are a few different ways you might invest in commodities or gain exposure to them:Purchasing the physical commodity. It’s possible to purchase a raw commodity, like a gold bar. However, if you go this route, you’ll need to account for the costs associated with holding a physical commodity like storage fees.Investing in commodity stocks or ETFs. If investing in physical commodities isn’t your speed, you can indirectly invest in commodities by investing in commodity stocks. These are stocks in companies that produce or process certain commodities. ""This approach benefits from both commodity price increases and the potential of the company to add value by increasing production of a particular commodity or providing income through the payment of a dividend,” says Samuelson. A commodity ETF tracks the prices of a commodity or that commodity's corresponding index and gives an investor ownership over a set of contracts backed by the commodity.Story continuesPros and cons of investing in commodities Like any other investment, commodities are not without their own set of benefits and drawbacks. If you’re thinking about investing in commodities, here are some of the major pros and cons to note:View this interactive chart on Fortune.comPro: Commodities can generate short-term profits. There’s no real way to time the market, but if you happen to purchase and sell a commodity at the right time, you could generate a significant profit. ""Since futures contracts generally require only a 5% margin, you could control $100,000 of copper for an initial investment of only $5,000. If the underlying price of copper rose 10%, the value of the copper you control would increase from $100,000 to $110,000 providing a $10,000 profit, but the return on your initial investment of $5,000 would be 100% ($10,000 profit on $5,000 initial investment),” says Samuelson. “Of course, you need to be right on the direction of the price of copper, and you can get a margin call requiring you to put up more money if the position moves against you.”Pro: Commodities can be a hedge against inflation. These assets tend to rise during times of high inflation when the value of the dollar sinks. According to 2021 research from Vanguard based on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, a 1% rise in unexpected inflation would produce a 7% to 9% rise in commodities.Con: Commodities can be extremely volatile. While commodities may not behave like other asset classes, they can still be risky. ""Commodities are notoriously volatile, and predicting their price movements can be difficult,” says Samuelson. “Unknowable events such as weather, geopolitics, and the global economic outlook can dramatically impact the supply and demand, and thus the price of commodities.”Con: Commodities don’t produce income for investors. Some investments like stocks, bonds, and real estate produce regular income for investors through dividends or rental income, but commodities do not produce income for investors unless they’re sold and a profit is realized from that sale.The takeaway Knowing the different types of investments available for you to invest in and how they typically behave can help you broaden your scope, diversify your portfolio, and potentially help hedge against inflation during times of economic turmoil.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, News (NASDAQ:NWSA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for News:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.069 = US$923m ÷ (US$16b - US$3.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, News has an ROCE of 6.9%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.5% average generated by the Media industry. View our latest analysis for News roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for News compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering News here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?News' ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 56% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.In Conclusion...To sum it up, News is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 23% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.Story continuesNews does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for News  that you might be interested in.While News isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

263,bc71cfe7-6d3d-301d-b41c-95cf9c05beff,VZ,2022-12-06,Is Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE:VZ) ROE Of 22% Impressive?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-120124058.html,1670328084,STORY,['VZ'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:22% = US$20b ÷ US$89b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Verizon Communications has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Verizon Communications' Debt And Its 22% Return On EquityVerizon Communications does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.70. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

However, although ISS acknowledges the strength and independence of the Board’s director nominees and the Company’s relative TSR outperformance, we respectfully disagree with ISS’s recommendation that stockholders support James Sullivan over Michael Stein.

IPAR is on track with effective product launches and strategic partnerships to boost growth. The provider of fragrances and related products is benefiting from solid brand performance. These upsides have boosted third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year. The solid performance prompted management to raise its 2022 view. Besides, the company recently unveiled its bright expectations for 2023.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s stock has rallied 29.1% in the past three months against the industry’s 7.2% decline. The stock has comfortably outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s 7.6% growth.Let’s discuss this in detail.Solid PerformanceInter Parfums’ third-quarter 2022 earnings came in at $1.30 per share, which increased 8% from $1.20 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly net sales increased 7% to $280 million compared with $263 million reported in the year-ago quarter. At comparable foreign currency rates, third-quarter net sales rose 12%.In the company’s U.S. operations, new brands like Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY generated 41% gains during the quarter. Organic growth from established brands like GUESS?, Oscar de la Renta, Hollister and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also contributed to the upside. Management highlighted that sales of its European operations increased 12% in euro, with the three largest brands, Montblanc, Jimmy Choo and Coach, outperforming by 11%, 32% and 3% year over year, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBright ViewConsidering a solid year-to-date performance and robust projections for the rest of the year, management raised its 2022 view at the time of the third-quarter earnings release. The company is optimistic about its business prospects and continues investing to gain market share and long-term growth. Management expects 2022 net sales of $1.025 billion, up from previous guidance of $1 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) are anticipated to come in at $3.40, higher than the earlier guidance of $3.25.For 2023, management anticipates net sales of $1.11 billion, which will likely result in earnings per diluted share of $3.70. This indicates net sales and earnings per diluted share growth of 8% and 9%, respectively, from the 2022 guided figures of $1.025 billion (net sales) and $3.40 (earnings per diluted share). Excluding certain one-time items, management expects 12% earnings per diluted share growth in 2023.Inter Parfums expects growth in 2023 to be driven by its solid brand portfolio and global distribution network. Further, sales growth will likely be backed by product launches. Management expects to gain from sustained travel retail business growth, a more streamlined supply-chain structure and modest pricing actions (which are likely to be undertaken in 2023 beginning).Story continuesFactors Driving GrowthInter Parfums is well-positioned to cater to elevated demand in the fragrance space. During 2022, the company introduced several scents, namely Montblanc Legend Red, CoachWild Rose, Coach Dreams Sunset, Coach Open Road, GUESS Uomo and Kate Spade Sparkle, among others. The company also launched brand extensions and flankers for several brands. In addition, the company unveiled Moncler’s debut scents at the beginning of 2022.For the next year, the company’s new product pipeline for U.S. brands consists of new pillars for the Hollister and MCM brands. The product pipeline is dominated by brand extensions and flankers. Management is on track with major launches for Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY brands for 2024. In European operations, the company will launch a new fragrance for Kate Spade in 2023.Inter Parfums is on track to expand its business through new licenses or acquisitions. The company is optimistic about the partnership with well-established fragrance brands like Donna Karan and DKNY. In December 2021, Inter Parfums, through its subsidiary Interparfums Italia signed a 10-year exclusive global licensing agreement with Emanuel Ungaro. In October 2021, Inter Parfums finalized the agreement with Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. Per the agreement, Inter Parfums holds the exclusive worldwide license for the production and distribution of Salvatore Ferragamo brand perfumes.We believe that well-chalked growth endeavors like strategic alliances, product launches and brand strength will likely keep IPAR’s growth story going.3 Solid Staple PicksSome top-ranked stocks are e.l.f.

The plant is scheduled to be operational in 2024.TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to major U.S. hardware manufacturers such as Apple and NVIDIA.""Bringing TSMC's investment to the United States is a masterstroke and a game-changing development for the industry,"" NVIDIA's Huang said in remarks prepared for Tuesday's event.TSMC executives will announce a plan to build a second nearby facility that will produce advanced chips by 2026.The company will announce its second plant will produce advanced N3 chips by 2026 and that its current facility will develop even more cutting-edge chips than originally proposed, going from N5 down to N4.TSMC's investment in Arizona at two facilities will total $40 billion, making it the company's largest investment outside of Taiwan, and one of the largest foreign direct investments in U.S. history.Biden has sought to boost production of semiconductors after the pandemic caused supply-chain problems that resulted in shortages of chips for vehicles and many other items.Story continuesU.S. semiconductor production now accounts for just 12% of the global total, down from 37% two decades ago, a White House report on supply-chain problems said last year.Taiwan's dominant position as a maker of chips used in technology from cell phones and cars to fighter jets has sparked concerns of over-reliance on the island, especially as China ramps up military pressure to assert its sovereignty claims.China claims Taiwan as its territory despite the strong objections of the democratically elected government in Taipei, which rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.The $52.7 billion ""Chips and Science"" act, signed by Biden in August, is aimed at preventing a resurgence of supply-chain woes.""The occasion for the president's travel is to mark a significant milestone that TSMC is reaching in bringing the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.,"" said Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council.Biden's victory in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election helped catapult him to the White House after Republican Donald Trump won the state in 2016.Biden has said he intends to seek a second four-year term in 2024.

The Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) the past four times to a range of 3.75% to 4%. Experts anticipate a further 50 bps hike when the Federal Reserve meets in December. Federal Reserve officials anticipate that the benchmark interest rate will peak around the 4.6% level over the next year. Meanwhile, some hawkish members of the Federal Reserve anticipate the interest rate to peak at around the 7% mark. Experts also believe that earnings could fall by 8% next year due to macroeconomic uncertainty.Amidst the bearish market momentum, it can be difficult to make investments in stocks with strong upside potential. Many analysts think that the quality of a stock can be gauged by its intrinsic value, returns, and earnings quality. However, there is no consensus on one particular basis to gauge quality. Some experts believe that price multiples like price-to-book (P/B) value, price-to-cash flow (P/CF), price-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (P/EBITDA), and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are sound measures to determine the quality of a stock. Furthermore, low volatility in the bottom line, high asset turnover and margins, low level of debt, and low-risk profile can also be considered indicators of high-quality stocks. In line with these metrics, companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are considered some of the best quality stocks in the market currently.11 Best Quality Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyStory continuesWe have shortlisted the 11 best quality stocks based on their business fundamentals and earnings quality.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Maryland-based aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with a global presence.The maker of the F-35 fighter has emerged as the biggest contract recipient with the US Department of Defense. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) received $39.2 billion worth of contracts from the Pentagon over the last year. Following the better-than-expected Q3 2022 results and an expanded share buyback plan, Peter J. Arment at Baird upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock from a Neutral to an Outperform rating while maintaining a target price of $513 on October 19.The analyst believes that the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows is still in place, and the strong buyback plan in a volatile market limits the downside potential of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Furthermore, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is expected to be a beneficiary of a ramped-up global defense expenditure at a time when tensions between global powers are high. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.48% as of December 5.Vltava Fund discussed its outlook on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company with a global footprint. The company claims that over 1.9 billion servings of its beverages are consumed across more than 200 countries every day.In a research note issued on October 26, Peter Grom at UBS maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and increased the price target from $63 to $68. The analyst termed the Q3 2022 results as strong and the increase in financial guidance as impressive. This was due to organic growth that was able to offset the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. The analyst believes that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) can trade at a premium against its peers due to the possibility of strong revenue growth in the upcoming quarters. This makes the risk and reward profile of the stock favorable for potential investors. Experts believe that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a price leadership position in the market and an advanced top-line growth management strategy that is expected to provide impetus to the top line. The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) annual dividend yield stands at 2.74% as of December 5.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, shared its stance on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the third biggest retailer in the world. The Issaquah, Washington-based company operates as a membership-only big box retailer with large warehouses.Analysts at Bank of America added Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock to the 'US 1 List' on November 22. The 'US 1 List' comprises the best investment ideas across all the sectors that are covered by the analysts at Bank of America. Experts believe that retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) will perform strongly through their low-priced private label brands as the consumer is trading down and buying fewer items. The holiday season is expected to provide a boost to the company due to higher consumer spending. Given the raging inflation, people will be looking for value, and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) falls under that category. Furthermore, the company’s membership program is also going strong as the annual renewal rate sits around the 90% mark. The stock's annual payout stands at $3.60, translating into a dividend yield of 0.68% as of December 5.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a Beaverton, Oregon-based company known for its footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment with a sports-based theme.

Although the stock is in the red YTD due to macroeconomic headwinds and industry-specific challenges, the analyst has a long-term bullish take on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Experts believe that the company will continue to grow due to its globally renowned brand, out-of-the-box products, and high growth in emerging markets.Leaven Partners discussed its outlook on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was held by 70 hedge funds at the end of Q3 2022.7.

Experts believe that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is heading towards a favorable setup with the possibility of donanemab providing more upside in treating Alzheimer's. As of December 5, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has an annual forward dividend yield of 1.05%.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was discussed in the Q3 2022 investor letter of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“In the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Brunswick, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer goods company.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap. The semiconductor industry is among the most popular and lucrative sectors in the world. With chips now starting to be heralded as the 'new oil', their ubiquity has ensured that the modern day world can not function without the valuable resource. Whether it is the smartphone in your hand, the computer on your desk, the engine control system in your car, or the large data centers that power your shopping experiences, chips are silently ticking away at the center of nearly every modern day convenience.Therefore, it is not surprising that the semiconductor industry itself has lucrative future estimates. For instance, a research report by Allied Markets Research believes that the industry was already worth $555 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21% to sit at a whopping $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm states that this growth will be driven by the growth in consumer electronics, particularly due to the growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets spurred by the proliferation of fifth generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence are now playing a central role in how major companies operate throughout the globe, and their computational requirements are also expected to spur the demand for advanced semiconductors.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has an even more optimistic growth outlook for the chip sector. It estimates that the industry was worth $528 billion in 2021, and from then until 2029, it will grow at a strong CAGR of 12.2% to be worth $1.3 trillion by as early as 2029. Fortune Business concurs with Allied Markets in the belief that IoT will spur growth, but it goes on to add that China will be the fastest growing region as larger chunks of its population gain smartphone access. The Chinese market already accounted for half of the semiconductor revenue pie in 2021, as it generated $289 billion worth of sales.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take look at the largest semiconductor firms in the world. You're likely to have come across several of them, due to regular media coverage for companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $15.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NVIDIA shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NVIDIA is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Semiconductor - General industry that ranks in the Bottom 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 82 cents per share to 80 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NVIDIA right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The results of the latest prospective study were published in the Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.Masimo’s SpHb technology currently supports clinicians and patient care in above 75 countries.The latest positive study outcome is a major stepping stone for Masimo’s non-invasive continuous hemoglobin monitoring business across the world. This is likely to solidify Masimo’s position in the global real-time patient monitoring space.Significance of the StudyResearchers noted that delayed or unnecessary blood transfusions have been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Hence, they sought to investigate continuous hemoglobin monitoring with Masimo SpHb, which offers continuous trending of hemoglobin levels, provided non-invasively and in real time.The researchers found that the study demonstrated that the postoperative red blood cell transfusion rate was lower and the hemoglobin level of ICU patients higher when monitored with SpHb in the operating room. Thus, they concluded that SpHb measurement in major surgical cases could accompany conventional Hb measurement methods, thus allowing effective patient blood management (PBM) practice. Per them, the use of such an advanced monitoring method in major surgeries may increase patient safety as this may decrease mortality and morbidity by reducing post-operative blood transfusion.The study adds additional evidence to the growing literature on the value of continuous hemoglobin monitoring with SpHb. SpHb, as part of patient blood management programs, has been found to improve outcomes in both high- and low-blood loss surgeries, such as reducing the units of red blood cells transfused per patient and reducing the time to transfusion, among other benefits. This evidence of SpHb’s impact on outcomes has been observed worldwide, thus representing seven countries on four different continents.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global PBM market is projected to reach $15.3 billion by 2024 from $10.7 billion in 2019 at a CAGR of 7.4%. Factors like the rising prevalence of blood disorders, the growing number of blood donations increasing the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections, and escalation in road accidents, injuries, surgeries and trauma are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the positive study outcome is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Masimo announced its third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line beating expected. The company’s robust uptick in the top line and its healthcare business was encouraging. Masimo also recorded robust order shipments and witnessed the solid expansion of its installed base during the reported quarter, which was promising.In August, Masimo announced the full market release of the Masimo W1 health watch for consumer use. In the same press release, the company also announced the availability of Masimo W1 with Hydration Index (Hi) in a limited market release and the launch of Personal SafetyNet (a paid subscription service integrated within the Masimo Health app). Additionally, Masimo also entered the general launch phase of a medical version of Masimo W1 for use in medical applications outside the United States, with extra measurement capabilities such as spot-check electrocardiogram and atrial fibrillation detection, among others.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have lost 48.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 20.9% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 12.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

MMSI scaled a new 52-week high of $73.69 on Dec 2, before closing the session marginally lower at $73.04.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 11.4% against a 5.9% decline of the industry and the S&amp;P 500 composite’s fall of 12.8%.In the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 17.4% compared with the industry’s 11.9% rise. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 11% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 9.5%. Merit Medical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 25.4%.Merit Medical is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its product launches. The optimism led by solid third-quarter 2022 performance and potential in its Cardiovascular unit are expected to contribute. However, stiff competition and a lack of direct sales and marketing capabilities persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversProduct Launches: Investors are optimistic about Merit Medical’s recent series of product launches. Last month, the company announced the U.S. commercial release of the basixALPHA Inflation Device, which is the latest addition to Merit Medical’s inflation device portfolio.Also in November, Merit Medical announced the U.S. commercial release of the PreludeSYNC EZ Radial Compression Device, which is the latest in the company’s ongoing efforts to advance transradial access for endovascular patient care.Potential in Cardiovascular Unit: Investors are optimistic about the unit’s robust potential. During the third quarter of 2022, Merit Medical witnessed a solid uptick in its Cardiovascular unit’s year-over-year revenues on a reported and constant exchange rate, organic basis. Revenues in the unit’s majority of the product categories — Peripheral Intervention, Cardiac Intervention and original equipment manufacturer — were also robust during the third quarter.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Merit Medical’s robust third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company’s year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines were impressive. Merit Medical saw revenue growth in both Cardiovascular and Endoscopy segments and across the majority of its product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Solid product sales were also promising. Robust performances in the United States and outside were impressive. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends pushed up the overall top line, which is encouraging.DownsidesLack of Direct Sales and Marketing Capabilities: Merit Medical lacks direct sales and marketing capabilities in many countries. The company wholly depends on third-party distributors to commercialize products in these countries. These countries include China, Japan, Russia and India. Per management, Merit Medical often fails to commercialize its products in these countries because of inefficiencies in the distributor base.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources and market presence. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology, diagnostics and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Both segments displayed strength in the first three quarters of fiscal 2022 and we expect this momentum to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter.With respect to the CVI segment, solid performance across the company’s daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and myopia management, and strength in torics and multifocals might have contributed to the segment’s performance in the quarter to be reported.In fact, for fiscal 2022, CVI revenues are projected in the range of $2.24-$2.25 billion (organic growth of 11% to 12%). This strength is likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results.CSI displayed strength in the fiscal third quarter of 2022, with revenues of $277 million. Revenues increased 39% from the year-ago period on a constant currency basis and 35% on a reported basis. The segment benefited from fertility products and surgical products.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Media Stocks To Buy Now.Over the past few years, the media industry has undergone a fair amount of change. One major trend observed, particularly post-pandemic, is that of a growing interest in the streaming video industry. As a result, traditional media in the form of newspapers, TV channels, and more is beginning to be replaced by online streaming. With the rise of the streaming video industry, media producers are beginning to face overwhelming pressure to keep producing engaging content and get it in front of their target audiences. According to a Deloitte report on the media sector’s outlook for 2022, in the US, the rate at which people add and cancel paid streaming services averaged around 35% in 2022. This rate of subscription churn is only one factor pressuring media producers to keep putting out hit content and stay on top of their game in an ever-evolving industry.Traditional media companies like Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. Series A (NASDAQ:WBD) and Paramount Global Class B (NASDAQ:PARA), alongside newer, less conventional media companies such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), are finding themselves embroiled in this new and transformative sector. However, these companies are also finding themselves in a better position in the media industry due to global conditions improving. According to a PwC report on the Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook for 2022-2026, the entertainment and media industry has seen an improvement from its contraction in 2020 to resume its growth path. Revenues for the industry rose by 10.4% in 2021. Additionally, the report forecasts that by 2026, the entertainment and media industry will also approach about $3 trillion in revenues.The report envisions the media industry to be a $2.9 trillion market by 2026, one that is more digital, mobile, and pitched at media targeting the younger generations. Between 2022 and 2026, the industry’s revenue is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. Additionally, the report observed a pattern of growing digitization of the entertainment and media industry, a trend that can mean greater profitability for the industry as it works to fit into a newer, more tech-savvy market. In 2021, advertising grew by 22.6%, representing a 32.3% growth in total industry revenues. This growth is largely fed by digital advertisements and their growing popularity within the media industry.Story continuesLet’s now take a look at the 12 best media stocks to buy now.Photo by Myke Simon on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected traditional and new media stocks for our list below, based on a range of factors representing their growth potential.

Under the terms of the agreement, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake in Hulu as early as January 2024.Which is what NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said Monday he expects will happen.""We have a put, they have a call,"" Shell said at an investor conference on Monday. ""We think [Hulu] is worth a lot of money because it's sold on a full control basis as if you were auctioning it off. And I think [there are] no indications that anything else is going to happen [other] than Disney writing us a big check for the asset in 2024.""Some analysts, however, have suggested Disney could sell its majority stake to help offset accelerating streaming losses amid an ultra-competitive landscape.""Personally, I think selling Hulu would be a good idea,"" Doug Creutz, senior analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.The analyst, who noted that Hulu is ""not a Disney branded product,"" said the media giant ""would be better off really focusing on the strengths of the company — that branded, high-quality, family content, rather than trying to be everything to everybody.""Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's NBCUniversal controlling the rest (""The Dropout"" // Courtesy: Hulu)At the time of the arrangement, Iger maintained the purchase would allow Disney the opportunity to offer an alternative, more mature viewing experience to consumers, in addition to providing more flexibility with bundling. That agreement — reached in May 2019 — set Disney's guaranteed minimum equity value for Hulu at $27.5 billion.Flash forward to today and streaming economics look a bit different to investors.Lightshed Partners’ Richard Greenfield, who previously argued waiting until 2024 for Disney to end the Hulu partnership with Comcast ""feels suboptimal,"" wrote in an updated blog post late last month there is a lack of clarity surrounding Hulu's true monetary value: ""Hulu’s actual worth is unclear if Disney wants to keep the Hulu original programming created by Disney for Disney+.""Story continues""Essentially, Iger has to decide on a streaming strategy,"" Greenfield wrote. ""Does Disney want to run multiple streaming services as they do now, focus all their energy on a vertically-integrated and more narrow Disney+ strategy or do they envision a world with just one 'everything' Disney service (combining Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+)?""In its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion for the year.The streaming division lost a combined $1.5 billion in the company's latest quarter. Shortly after these results, Disney established ""a cost structure taskforce."" Weeks later, Bob Iger returned as CEO.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.As for NBCUniversal, Shell argued Peacock — though in part powered by content coming off Hulu — will remain in a position of strength thanks to key programming decisions like sports offerings.""Every sports deal we have basically has a Peacock component,"" Shell said.Peacock subscribers have reached 18 million to date, up from September's 15 million, and Shell said even amid an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, ad sales are up in the mid-single digits compared to a year ago.""It's hard for me not to get out of my seat right now and jump up and down about how Peacock is doing,"" Shell said.Still, Shell warned the overall media sector will likely see weakness in the fourth quarter amid a softening advertising market and an acceleration in cord cutting.""Our EBITDA will be challenged a little bit more than we thought [in Q4],"" Shell said. ""But looking out to 2023, I don't think it's that worrisome.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Prices have increased for everything from park tickets to the Genie+ add-on service. Single-park tickets at Disneyland, depending on the tier, now range anywhere from $115 to $179. Those purchasing Park Hopper passes, enabling them to go to Disneyland and California Adventure on the same day, will pay anywhere from $179 to $244.Holiday Spending: Get Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsAdvice: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The Genie+ add-on service, which allows guests to enjoy their favorite rides without long waits, is also increasing from $20 to $25 per day at Disneyland.At Walt Disney World, ticket prices were raised in February and are not part of the recent bump. But the price for Genie+ will vary instead of remaining a flat fee.While there’s nothing magical about the sticker shock of these price increases, it is possible to navigate a visit to Disney parks on a budget. Here’s how to find the best deals while carefully determining which experiences matter most to you and your family.Buy Disney Gift CardsAn overwhelming number of frequent Disney visitors whom GOBankingRates spoke to insisted the best budget hack for visiting Disneyland and Disney World is buying gift cards.Disney gift cards can easily be purchased in bulk at retailers such as Target, BJs Wholesale Club and Sam’s Club. You can use them to pay for your park tickets or any merchandise you want to buy while visiting the parks. The general recommendation is to put these gift cards toward your shopping and souvenir budget and spend the entire balance during your trip.Take Our Poll: Do You Think You Will Be Able To Retire at Age 65?Bring Your Own FoodThis is a tip that never gets old when visiting Disney Parks. Disneyland and Disney World both allow visitors to bring outside food and non-alcoholic beverages to the parks. If you need a place to store your food, Kristy Esparza, founder of JJ &amp; The Bug, recommends leaving your lunches and snacks in the lockers near the picnic area located outside the Disneyland main entrance.Story continuesBringing your own food means saving money on dining throughout the day. It also means you can pack all of your kids’ favorite foods, especially if they have dietary restrictions, and avoid struggling to find empty tables at crowded restaurants during peak meal times.Remember to keep hydrated by refilling bottled water at nearby fountains. In the event you need to spring for a churro snack, put it on your Disney gift card.Visit the Parks During Shoulder SeasonYour visit to Disney parks should be scheduled in the shoulder seasons. Ideally, the general recommendation is planning to go in late January or early February.While Disney parks are generally busy year round, there are fewer crowds after the holidays. This gives families planning for Disney trips the ability to get reservations and rooms at the hotels they want and access more rides during their visits.Skip the Park HopperFamilies visiting Disney World may want to consider whether they’ll benefit from a Park Hopper pass.The reason to reconsider buying the Park Hopper, according to the Disney Parks enthusiasts GOBankingRates spoke with, is that it takes significantly more time to travel between the Orlando parks. Large families or groups may find they’re spending more time traveling to a park than they are enjoying the overall experience.The same can be said about the Park Hopper option at Disneyland. Consider which park you want to spend the most time in and save money by paying for a ticket specific to that park only.Reconsider Adding Genie+Esparza enjoyed a family trip to Disneyland earlier this month. She went with her husband and two sons, who are 5 and 7 years old.The family decided to use Genie+ for their Disneyland day. However, what surprised Esparza was how much the kids enjoyed the smaller activities. Their favorite parts of the day were experiences where you generally don’t need to use Genie+, like visits to the Enchanted Tiki Room and the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage.Esparza recommends weighing whether Genie+ is worth it for your family. This answer varies based on the rides and experiences you prioritize at the parks. When in doubt, find a moment to slow down and enjoy Disneyland magic through the eyes of your family members. You’ll be able to save more and better enjoy being in the moment together.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a Month25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All Costs3 Easy Tips to Turn Your Credit Woes into WowsExpert Tips To Help Improve Your Credit on a Limited IncomeThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: As Disney Prices Rise, How To Make Your Trip Affordable]"

Web application and API attacks in particular are increasing at an alarming rate while also growing in complexity. The new report, Enemy at the Gates, further notes that roughly 80 percent of cyberattackers additionally aim their efforts at customers of financial services in an attempt to find paths of least resistance for monetary gain.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logoEnemy at the Gates shows that financial services in APJ is among the most attacked verticals in several critical areas: web application and API attacks, DDoS, phishing, zero-day exploitation, and botnet activities. Most concerning is the staggering surge in web application and API attacks — a 449 percent growth in the number of attacks against APJ financial services year-over-year. Earlier this year, we found web apps and API vectors commonly used by ransomware groups to gain initial access via the exploitation of vulnerabilities. The surge in web app and API attacks in APJ seems to correlate with the high GDPs of some of the affected countries in the region. The shortage of cybersecurity skills or talent in the region could potentially be a factor in the increasing number of successful cyberattacks. Knowing what the attackers are focusing on could help organizations and security practitioners in APJ have a better understanding of their risk exposures and prioritize securing potential weaknesses.Other key findings of the report include:The growing number of attacks and increased sophistication coincides with an increasing number of cyberattacks in the region, primarily resulting in ransomware. A recent Akamai Ransomware Threat Report APJ Deep Dive H1 2022 connects web app and API attacks with ransomware.Australia, Japan and India are the countries with the highest number of web application and API attacks in the region.Within 24 hours, exploitation of newly discovered zero-days against financial services reaches multiple thousands of attacks per hour and peaks quickly - affording little time to patch and react.A significant increase in Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks demonstrate how attackers are shifting toward remote code execution attempts that present a larger strain on internal network security.Phishing campaigns against financial services customers are introducing techniques that bypass two-factor authentication solutions and increase risk for everyday customers.Customer account takeover attempts represent over 40 percent of attack types with another 40 percent focusing on website scraping, which is used to create more convincing phishing scams.Story continues""Financial services is one of the most attacked industries when new vulnerabilities are discovered, a favorite target of DDoS attacks and continuously focused on by phishing campaigns, which are aimed at their customers who suffer the brunt of these attacks,"" said Steve Winterfeld, Advisory CISO for Akamai. ""Attackers will always find ways to infiltrate your network or impact your customers. Understanding attack surfaces could provide insights into key risks and therefore allow organizations to devise security controls and mitigation plans to better protect customers.""For additional information, the security community can access, engage with, and learn from Akamai's threat researchers by visiting the new Akamai Security Hub and following the team on Twitter at @Akamai_Research.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

310,c4112c79-4700-4e03-961c-f492fefce0fb,CMCSA,2022-12-06,NBCUniversal CEO: We expect a 'big check' from Disney for our Hulu stake next year,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nbc-universal-disney-hulu-ownership-201240535.html,1670271160,STORY,"['CMCSA', 'DIS']","[As Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger charts a path to streaming profitability, one big question remains: buy or sell Hulu?Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal controlling the rest. Under the terms of the agreement, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake in Hulu as early as January 2024.Which is what NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said Monday he expects will happen.""We have a put, they have a call,"" Shell said at an investor conference on Monday. ""We think [Hulu] is worth a lot of money because it's sold on a full control basis as if you were auctioning it off. And I think [there are] no indications that anything else is going to happen [other] than Disney writing us a big check for the asset in 2024.""Some analysts, however, have suggested Disney could sell its majority stake to help offset accelerating streaming losses amid an ultra-competitive landscape.""Personally, I think selling Hulu would be a good idea,"" Doug Creutz, senior analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.The analyst, who noted that Hulu is ""not a Disney branded product,"" said the media giant ""would be better off really focusing on the strengths of the company — that branded, high-quality, family content, rather than trying to be everything to everybody.""Disney owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's NBCUniversal controlling the rest (""The Dropout"" // Courtesy: Hulu)At the time of the arrangement, Iger maintained the purchase would allow Disney the opportunity to offer an alternative, more mature viewing experience to consumers, in addition to providing more flexibility with bundling. That agreement — reached in May 2019 — set Disney's guaranteed minimum equity value for Hulu at $27.5 billion.Flash forward to today and streaming economics look a bit different to investors.Lightshed Partners’ Richard Greenfield, who previously argued waiting until 2024 for Disney to end the Hulu partnership with Comcast ""feels suboptimal,"" wrote in an updated blog post late last month there is a lack of clarity surrounding Hulu's true monetary value: ""Hulu’s actual worth is unclear if Disney wants to keep the Hulu original programming created by Disney for Disney+.""Story continues""Essentially, Iger has to decide on a streaming strategy,"" Greenfield wrote. ""Does Disney want to run multiple streaming services as they do now, focus all their energy on a vertically-integrated and more narrow Disney+ strategy or do they envision a world with just one 'everything' Disney service (combining Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+)?""In its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion for the year.The streaming division lost a combined $1.5 billion in the company's latest quarter. Shortly after these results, Disney established ""a cost structure taskforce."" Weeks later, Bob Iger returned as CEO.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.As for NBCUniversal, Shell argued Peacock — though in part powered by content coming off Hulu — will remain in a position of strength thanks to key programming decisions like sports offerings.""Every sports deal we have basically has a Peacock component,"" Shell said.Peacock subscribers have reached 18 million to date, up from September's 15 million, and Shell said even amid an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, ad sales are up in the mid-single digits compared to a year ago.""It's hard for me not to get out of my seat right now and jump up and down about how Peacock is doing,"" Shell said.Still, Shell warned the overall media sector will likely see weakness in the fourth quarter amid a softening advertising market and an acceleration in cord cutting.""Our EBITDA will be challenged a little bit more than we thought [in Q4],"" Shell said. ""But looking out to 2023, I don't think it's that worrisome.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

312,ddb4a1f1-9045-3f24-bd78-aa5e914e698b,DVN,2022-12-06,Devon Energy Corporation's (NYSE:DVN) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporations-nyse-dvn-144333504.html,1670251413,STORY,['DVN'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Devon Energy's (NYSE:DVN) recent performance, when its stock has declined 4.2% over the past month. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Devon Energy's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:58% = US$6.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.58 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Devon Energy's Earnings Growth And 58% ROETo begin with, Devon Energy has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 32% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Devon Energy's considerable five year net income growth of 35% was to be expected.As a next step, we compared Devon Energy's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 6.8%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Devon Energy is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Devon Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Devon Energy has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 12%, meaning that it has the remaining 88% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, Devon Energy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 13% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Devon Energy's future ROE will drop to 16% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Devon Energy's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy.2022 has been the year for energy stocks. While all sectors of the economy fluctuated, the energy sector remained relatively robust, as energy stocks have been enjoying higher oil prices. Oil prices have soared in 2022, primarily due to the Ukraine war. However, oil prices recently started to tumble, and this trend was met by OPEC Plus voting for a production cut of 2 million barrels a day in early October. It was speculated that another production cut might be on the way. However, on December 4, The Washing Post reported that OPEC Plus voted against cutting oil production and agreed on keeping production steady.On November 29, the portfolio manager of the Hennessy Midstream Fund and the Hennessy Transition Fund, Ben Cook, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where he discussed the energy market, energy stocks, and commodities among other factors that are expected to drive outperformance in the energy sector. According to Ben Cook, the energy sector's outperformance can be sustained since energy companies ""have redirected a significant amount of cash flow back to paying down debt, returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases"" therefore improving their financial health. Here are some comments from Ben Cook about why he is bullish on energy and sees continued outperformance:""Historically, there has been a close correlation between the commodity, if you look at the twelve-month future strip, and the equities, they have tracked fairly closely. And again, we have seen that divergence occur because I think the market is acknowledging, again, the financial conditions of these companies that have improved dramatically. And over time, as we see continued strength in commodity fundamentals, we expect that divergence to actually resolve to the upside with commodity prices moving higher, and we think the equities will continue to enjoy the benefits of that strong commodity environment. This is not just for oils, this is for natural gas as well...""Story continuesBen Cook also shared his thoughts about OPEC policy and what his base case is for crude oil prices in 2023. Here are some comments from the analyst:""OPEC is wrestling with a variety of issues right now obviously, the weakness in China, associated with the zero-Covid lockdown policy. They are dealing with a global monetary system that is tightening post-pandemic. We continue to believe that OPEC will be very supportive of crude prices, they would like to see oil prices higher than where we are right now. Our base case is that we see a range of crude oil prices between $80 and $100 into 2023, and again, that should support very strong operational and financial results for the companies in our investable universe...""Some of the top-performing energy stocks in 2022 have been Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and they are well-positioned to sustain this outperformance into 2023 and beyond.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Flat: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 784 for the week ended Dec 02.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap. The semiconductor industry is among the most popular and lucrative sectors in the world. With chips now starting to be heralded as the 'new oil', their ubiquity has ensured that the modern day world can not function without the valuable resource. Whether it is the smartphone in your hand, the computer on your desk, the engine control system in your car, or the large data centers that power your shopping experiences, chips are silently ticking away at the center of nearly every modern day convenience.Therefore, it is not surprising that the semiconductor industry itself has lucrative future estimates. For instance, a research report by Allied Markets Research believes that the industry was already worth $555 billion in 2021. From then until 2031, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21% to sit at a whopping $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm states that this growth will be driven by the growth in consumer electronics, particularly due to the growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets spurred by the proliferation of fifth generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, machine learning and artificial intelligence are now playing a central role in how major companies operate throughout the globe, and their computational requirements are also expected to spur the demand for advanced semiconductors.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has an even more optimistic growth outlook for the chip sector. It estimates that the industry was worth $528 billion in 2021, and from then until 2029, it will grow at a strong CAGR of 12.2% to be worth $1.3 trillion by as early as 2029. Fortune Business concurs with Allied Markets in the belief that IoT will spur growth, but it goes on to add that China will be the fastest growing region as larger chunks of its population gain smartphone access. The Chinese market already accounted for half of the semiconductor revenue pie in 2021, as it generated $289 billion worth of sales.Story continuesWith these details in mind, it is time to take look at the largest semiconductor firms in the world. You're likely to have come across several of them, due to regular media coverage for companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for McDonald's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald'sOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$256 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$272, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 53% of Ian Borden's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of McDonald's shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Have McDonald's Insiders Traded Recently?The last three months saw some McDonald's insider selling. insider Anthony Capuano divested only US$8.7k worth of shares in that time. It's not great to see insider selling, nor the lack of recent buyers. But the volume sold is so low that it really doesn't bother us.Story continuesDoes McDonald's Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$185m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The McDonald's Insider Transactions Indicate?Our data shows a little more insider selling, but no insider buying, in the last three months. But the sales were small, so we're not concerned. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the McDonald's insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with McDonald's and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

320,2c63b6ac-6f63-3b71-bb9c-8c3423d61f4e,PLD,2022-12-06,Start Building A Basket of REITs With These 5 Stocks,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/start-building-basket-reits-5-152456160.html,1670253896,STORY,"['ESS', 'O', 'DLR-PK', 'PLD']","[As investors begin to see light at the end of the Federal Reserve rate-hike tunnel, real estate investment trusts (REITs) are bouncing back off their lows of six weeks ago. Now could be an ideal time to start building a basket of REIT stocks. But with 208 REITs to choose from, how does an investor know which ones make the best purchases?Take a look at five well-established REITs from diversified subsectors that have high-quality, long-term total returns (appreciation plus nonreinvested dividends) that could be a great start toward building your long-term basket of REITs:Digital Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: DLR) is an Austin, Texas-based data center REIT with more than 300 facilities in large metro areas across 23 countries.The 52-week price range is $85.76 to $178.22, and the most recent closing price was $111.70. It pays an annual dividend of $4.88, which yields 4.4%.Since 2004, Digital Realty Trust has had a total return of 1,263.13%, or an average annual total return of 15.56%. That kind of long-term return is pretty tough to match.Essex Property Trust Inc. (NYSE: ESS) is a San Mateo, California-based residential REIT that owns and manages 62,000 apartment units in 253 communities, along with some retail space in eight West Coast markets of the U.S. Essex Property Trust was founded in 1971 and launched its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994.Essex Property Trust has a record of 28 consecutive years of dividend increases, making it an S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat. According to its website, it was the only REIT to increase its dividend during the recession in 2010.Since 1995, Essex Property Trust has had a total return of 1,841.51%, or 11.47% per year.A favorite among investors, Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) is a worldwide retail REIT with over 11,400 commercial properties on long-term net leases. Its tenant list mostly comprises large, well-known companies like Walgreens Co., Dollar Tree Inc. and FedEx Corp.Realty Income is one of only 65 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats because it has increased its dividend 117 times for at least 25 consecutive years. In addition, it pays its dividend on a monthly basis, which is advantageous for income investors.Story continuesThe annual dividend is $2.98, for a yield of 4.7%. Since 1995, Realty Income has had a total return of $1,248.95%, or just under 10% per year.Caretrust REIT Inc. (NYSE: CTRE) is a San Clemente, California-based healthcare REIT that owns and leases senior housing, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. Its portfolio consists of 198 properties in 21 states.Caretrust has an annual dividend of $1.10 that presently yields 5.5%. Over the past five years, its dividend has grown by 50%. Although it hasn’t been around as long as the other REITs on this list, since 2014 it has had a total return of 121.96%, with an average annual total return of 9.82%.The 52-week range is $15.90 to $23.59, and its most recent closing price was $19.88.Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages over 5,000 industrial logistics properties throughout the U.S. and 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, the company has been a leader in appreciation among REIT stocks. Although it pays an annual dividend of $3.16, it is more growth- than income-oriented, with an annual dividend yield of 2.8%.Since 1997, Prologis has had a total return of 588.49%, or 8.01% per year.While there is no guarantee that these particular REITs will perform as well or better than their long-term records, it always makes sense to start building an investment basket with the leading stocks in any particular field.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

This led to a year-over-year improvement in the third-quarter 2022 results. Also, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line lagged the same.In the said quarter, adjusted earnings of $2.10 per share improved 7.7% year over year. Net sales jumped 8.4% year over year to $3,270.8 million, driven by an increase of 5.7% in comps, led by growth of 7% in comparable average tickets, which offset a 1.3% decline in comparable average transaction count.Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, the top line surged 65%, while comps advanced 46%. Also, a sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comps growth.The company is on track to build up on Tractor Supply’s Out Here lifestyle assortment and convenient shopping format to gain customers and market share. The strategy is based on five key pillars, including customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return.As part of the plan, it revised the long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026. Management envisions net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to grow 8-11%, up from the previously stated 8-10%. Notably, the company earlier launched the Field Activity Support Team (“FAST”), and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.Tractor Supply is in the initial phase of transforming its side lots and mature stores to improve space productivity, bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life and advancing efforts to remain nationally strong and locally relevant. Management anticipates transforming the side lots in 100 locations in 2022. These have been significant investments in stores. These are expected to boost productivity across the company’s existing and new stores.Given the changing consumer trends, Tractor Supply is focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience. Incidentally, the company is on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy aimed at connecting store and online shopping. TSCO’s omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app. Its e-commerce business witnessed year-over-year growth in the high-single digits.In the third quarter, TSCO added app features such as My Pet and upgraded its in-store mode. Tractor Supply exited the third quarter with 27 million Neighbor's Club members accounting for 75% of the total quarterly sales. The company also expanded the program to include Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. The move will enable it to gain pet customers for both banners. The mobile app has also been performing well. Management expects more than $2 billion in sales by 2026.Its store-expansion initiatives bode well. The company is well-positioned to expand its store base, remaining on track to increase its domestic store to 2,500 in the long term. In the third quarter, the company opened 11 Tractor Supply stores and two Petsense stores. Management is on track with its store-opening initiatives. It plans to open 60-70 Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores in 2022.Driven by these factors, management raised its guidance for 2022. The view reflects the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, which is likely to contribute $75 million to sales in the fourth quarter and 2022. The company expects net sales of $14.06-$14.12 billion, up from the prior mentioned $13.95-$14.05 billion. Comps are likely to grow 5.4-5.8%, up from earlier stated 5.2-5.8% growth.The operating margin for the same period is anticipated to be 10.1-10.15% compared with the previously stated 10.2%. Earnings per share are likely to be $9.55-$9.63, up from the earlier mentioned $9.48-$9.60. The view includes gains from the 53rd week in 2022, which is expected to contribute 1.5 percentage points to the top line and 15 cents to the bottom line.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 20.1% in the past three months compared with the industry's 14.6% growth.However, the company has been reeling under cost inflation and higher transportation costs. Tractor Supply has also been witnessing elevated costs in the commodity inputs in its product categories. Higher labor wages and transportation costs have been adversely impacting its vendor partners. Management expects rising inflation to persist throughout 2023, with some normalization in the back half of 2023.ConclusionAll said, online strength, solid demand and well-chalked-out endeavors are likely to help the stock sustain its momentum. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current financial year’s sales and earnings suggests growth of 10.5% and 11.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Topping it, TSCO's earnings estimates for 2022 have moved up 0.3% in the past 60 days. Also, a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3% reflects its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked stocks to consider, namely Wingstop WING, Ross Stores ROST and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.Wingstop currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

329,915feddf-9200-30dd-a00b-5c66e98f32b7,MDLZ,2022-12-06,Investors in Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) have made a respectable return of 76% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-mondelez-international-nasdaq-mdlz-110054501.html,1670324454,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) shareholders have enjoyed a 57% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 44% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 12% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Mondelez International managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 9%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Mondelez International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Mondelez International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Mondelez International the TSR over the last 5 years was 76%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Mondelez International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 12% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

330,5af5c06b-8879-3d2c-90be-e68debca38c6,MDLZ,2022-12-06,Mondelez (MDLZ) Up More Than 10% in 3 Months: Will Growth Stay?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-mdlz-more-10-3-132801839.html,1670246881,STORY,"['MDLZ', 'SJM', 'LW']","[Mondelez International, Inc. MDLZ appears poised with its brand strength due to prudent buyouts and innovation. Efficient pricing and a focus on the chocolate and biscuit business are driving the company amid escalated cost concerns.These upsides were visible in Mondelez’s third-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results gained from the resilience of its snacking products, brand strength, broad-based revenue growth across both emerging and developed markets, pricing actions and robust volume growth.Driven by the solid quarterly results and continued momentum in the snacks business, management raised its guidance for 2022. Management expects organic net revenues of more than 10% for 2022 compared with the more than 8% growth stated earlier.Further, MDLZ updated the view on the sturdy year-to-date performance. It envisions a 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share or EPS at cc compared with the prior mentioned mid-to-high-single-digit growth.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 13.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 9.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2022 EPS has risen from $2.90 to $2.93 over the past 60 days. Let’s delve deeper.Mondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mondelez International, Inc. QuoteFactors Working WellMondelez has always been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions and alliances. The company has been expanding its snacking category in particular.As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, MDLZ’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.In its third-quarter earnings release, the company noted that it closed the Ricolino buyout, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar.  Management announced incremental investments in the Cocoa Life program and expanded its target to source all cocoa volumes from Cocoa Life by 2030.Mondelez concluded the integration of the Chipita S.A. business, which was acquired in January 2022 and is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from this acquisition boosted net revenues in the quarter under review.In 2021, Mondelez took over a renowned sports performance and active nutrition brand – Grenade. Further, the company acquired the Australia-based food company — Gourmet Food Holdings — which operates in the premium biscuit and cracker category. Mondelez completed the acquisition of Hu Master Holdings, the parent company of Hu Products, on Jan 4, 2021.Mondelez remains encouraged by the underlying emerging market strength. In the third quarter of 2022, revenues from emerging markets increased 19.7% to $3,094 million while rising 24.4% on an organic basis.The company saw double-digit growth in Cadbury Dairy Milk, Toblerone, Lacta and Bis in the third quarter of 2022. Gum &amp; Candy surged more than 22%. Management noted that Brazil, Mexico, Western India, the Middle East and North Africa delivered a solid performance.Story continuesWill Cost Woes be Offset?Mondelez has been battling cost inflation for a while now. In the third quarter of 2022, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 100 basis points (bps) to 37.4% due to increased raw material and transportation costs and an adverse mix. Also, the adjusted operating income margin contracted by 110 bps to 16.1% due to inflated input costs and an adverse mix.The company is seeing input cost inflation, particularly in energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. The company is also navigating through supply-chain bottlenecks. Management expects double-digit cost inflation, per its third-quarter earnings call.However, robust pricing actions have been aiding MDLZ. In the third quarter of 2022, pricing actions boosted organic net revenues and offered partial respite to the company’s adjusted gross profit margin and adjusted operating margin, which was otherwise hurt by cost inflation and an adverse mix. Mondelez is on track with its Revenue Growth Management activities and more investments in people, markets and capabilities.In its third-quarter earnings release, Mondelez stated that to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation, it already implemented price increases across key markets, including Europe. Mondelez also revealed plans to implement another round of price increases worldwide, including the United States, which is likely to be effective from December 2022.All said, we believe that Mondelez is likely to continue with its solid growth story.Looking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

The report indicates 7.7% year-over-year growth on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This was down slightly from the 8.2% year-over-year gain in the prior month but still substantially higher than the Fed's 2% target. Thus, in a recent speech on Dec. 1 the Brookings Institution, Federal Reserve Chariman Jerome Powell was still hawkish on inflation and said he plans to stay the course until the job is done.""Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with OXY. Click here to check it out. OXY 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of OXYPeter Lynch Chart of OXYPowell acknowledged that the economy has slowed down substantially and it is getting tough for many businesses. However, he did highlight that inflation is coming down substantially in areas such as the cost of cars, furniture and appliances. Nevertheless, labor market conditions are still tight with wages rising faster than expected. Health care and food inflation also remains high, as does energy.Rental and housing costs remain elevated, and these expenses make up one-third of the CPI index. Although Powell expects this metric to come down next year as rental contracts are renewed, it likely won't be by much unless we have a wave of foreclosures like in 2008, which is unlikely due to the manufactured housing shortage.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedGiven these factors, Powell is taking a hard stance and believes that to restore price stability, interest rates will need to remain elevated with hikes expected to continue. Powell references the 1970s, in which prematurely loosening interest rates, resulted in a swift return of inflation.For investors, this means it's important to diversify with inflation hedge. My favorite inflation hedge stock is one that Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)(BRK.B) has been loading up on this year: Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Here's why I believe this unconventional inflation hedge could be ideal in the current stock market environment.Story continuesThe case for oil as an inflation hedgeEnergy makes up a substantial part of the consumer price index (CPI), and oil prices increased by 17.6% in September. This was driven by a 17.5% spike in gas prices per barrel, driven by a variety of macroeconomic factors including the economic reopening and the Russia-Ukraine war.The WTI (West Texas Intermediate) oil price went negative in 2020 as travel declined to almost nothing, but then spiked to $120 per barrel by June 2022. Since then, prices have started to fall, but they are still higher than the pre-pandemic levels of $59 per barrel.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedI don't think oil prices are likely to tank much in the near-term, as their are many factors that continue to support higher prices, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and OPEC mulling further production cuts.I see Occidental Petroleum as an ideal inflation hedge for two main reasons: one, this is a highly diversified oil and gas company, and two, gurus have been interested in the stock recently, as shown in the below chart. Most of the buys falling outside the quarterly numbers were from Buffett, and when added to the quarterly additions from other gurus, the sentiment on the stock seems to be bullish overall.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedAbout OccidentalOccidental Petroleum runs a globally diversified operation across Texa,s Colorado, New Mexico, the Middle East and North Africa. The business is also has a mix of long cycle and short cycle oil production operations, which offers a diversified mix of quick hit supplies and longer-term steady state volume derived from the Permian Basin. Occidental also has exposure to the natural gas liquids (NGL) market, which has now become the go-to alternative to Russian oil in Europe.Occidental also has a thriving chemical business called OxyChem which converts the unwanted excess from fuel production into valuable chemicals.Many people don't want to invest in oil stocks because, like cigarette stocks, they're destined for eventual long-term decline. Occidental is far from a leader in the transition to green energy, outclassed by many peers on this front, but it does own a subsidiary called Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, which uses advanced technology to reduce emissions.Growing financials Occidental continues to benefit from high oil prices. The company reported solid financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Revenue was $9.38 billion, which beat analyst estimates by $452 million and increased by a rapid 38% year-over-year.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedThe company also produced solid earnings per share of $2.52, which beat analyst expectations by $0.11. Occidental is a cash cow at the moment, having generated $2.8 billion in the third quarter. This was down slightly from the record $3.9 billion reported in the second quarter, but still up over the prior year.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedBy segment, for the third quarter, the oil and gas segment reported solid pre-tax income of $3.3 billion. This was slightly less than the pre-tax income of $4.1 billion in the prior quarter but still up substantially year-over-year.Occidentals Chemical segment and its Midstream and Marketing segment both surpassed management guidance with pre-tax earnings of $580 million and $104 million.The company has a precarious balance sheet with $1.2 billion in cash and short term investments compared to debt of $21.4 billion, but it has managed its debt structure well as just $184 million of this is current debt due within the next two years.Occidentals management also paid off $1.3 billion worth of debt in the third quarter, which compounds on top of the humongous $9.6 billion worth of debt paid off in the trailing 12 months. This is incredibly prudent and smart giving the rising interest rate environment.Management also ordered the repurchase of 28.4 million shares for a staggering $1.8 billion. This compounds on top of the 41.8 million shares bought back in the trailing 12 months, so the company is not neglecting shareholders even as it focuses on paying down debt.Occidental does pay a 0.59% dividend yield, which is consistent, which is not great but better than nothing.Advanced valuation In order to value Occidental Petroleum, I have plugged the latest financials into my advanced valuation model, which uses the discounted cash flow method of valuation. Valuing Occidental is fairly challenging as its future cash flows are dependent upon oil prices and interest rates. Therefore, to be conservative, I have forecasted oil prices (and thus revenue) to decline by 10% next year. This is my worst case scenario considering the 38% revenue growth rate reported recently. In years two through five, I am forecasting a stabilization in growth with 10% revene growth per year.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedI have also capitalized the companys operating leases to increase margins. In addition, I have forecasted the businesss operating margin to decline from 37% to 30% over nine years. Again, this is driven by conservative estimates of future oil prices.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedGiven these factors. I get a fair value estimate of $179 per share. Since the stock trades at $68 per share at the time of writing, it is ~62% undervalued.Occidental trades at a price-earnings ratio of 5.69, which is 80% cheaper than its five-year average.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedHowever, the GF Value calculator does indicate a fair value of $53 per share and estimates the stock is significantly overvalued. I believe this may be unfairly skewed due to the extremely high volatility of the stock, as part of the GF Value calculation comes from historical growth and price multiples. Occidental's business was in shambles a few years ago, causing the stock price to drop like a stone before it was buoyed by the current positive environment.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedOccidental trades at an enterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratio of 4 , which is at the middle of the range relative to other companies in the oil sector. For example, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) trades slightly more expensive at anenterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratio of 5.82, whereas Shell (SHEL) trades cheaper with an enterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratio of 3.97 and BP (BP) trades at an enterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratio of 4.5.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedFinal thoughts Occidental Petroleum is a tremendous energy company that is diversified across products and geographies. Many people thought oil was dead in 2020, but as energy security and thus fossil fuels are still vital, profits are flowing. Management is prudently paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders, which is a positive sign. Buffetts substantial purchases of the stock are also a huge point in its favor, in my opinion.This Inflation Hedge Stock Is Deeply UndervaluedThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy.2022 has been the year for energy stocks. While all sectors of the economy fluctuated, the energy sector remained relatively robust, as energy stocks have been enjoying higher oil prices. Oil prices have soared in 2022, primarily due to the Ukraine war. However, oil prices recently started to tumble, and this trend was met by OPEC Plus voting for a production cut of 2 million barrels a day in early October. It was speculated that another production cut might be on the way. However, on December 4, The Washing Post reported that OPEC Plus voted against cutting oil production and agreed on keeping production steady.On November 29, the portfolio manager of the Hennessy Midstream Fund and the Hennessy Transition Fund, Ben Cook, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where he discussed the energy market, energy stocks, and commodities among other factors that are expected to drive outperformance in the energy sector. According to Ben Cook, the energy sector's outperformance can be sustained since energy companies ""have redirected a significant amount of cash flow back to paying down debt, returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases"" therefore improving their financial health. Here are some comments from Ben Cook about why he is bullish on energy and sees continued outperformance:""Historically, there has been a close correlation between the commodity, if you look at the twelve-month future strip, and the equities, they have tracked fairly closely. And again, we have seen that divergence occur because I think the market is acknowledging, again, the financial conditions of these companies that have improved dramatically. And over time, as we see continued strength in commodity fundamentals, we expect that divergence to actually resolve to the upside with commodity prices moving higher, and we think the equities will continue to enjoy the benefits of that strong commodity environment. This is not just for oils, this is for natural gas as well...""Story continuesBen Cook also shared his thoughts about OPEC policy and what his base case is for crude oil prices in 2023. Here are some comments from the analyst:""OPEC is wrestling with a variety of issues right now obviously, the weakness in China, associated with the zero-Covid lockdown policy. They are dealing with a global monetary system that is tightening post-pandemic. We continue to believe that OPEC will be very supportive of crude prices, they would like to see oil prices higher than where we are right now. Our base case is that we see a range of crude oil prices between $80 and $100 into 2023, and again, that should support very strong operational and financial results for the companies in our investable universe...""Some of the top-performing energy stocks in 2022 have been Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and they are well-positioned to sustain this outperformance into 2023 and beyond.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6.

But recently released data tells a different story.In November, there were 35,132 tech job postings in the finance and insurance sector, according to CompTIA’s analysis of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report released on Dec. 2. CompTIA, an IT industry group, found that tech occupations in all industry sectors grew by 137,000 positions in November. Meanwhile, tech companies added workers for the 24th consecutive month—14,400 workers in November, and tech sector employment has increased by 207,200 this year. “There are still many more employers hiring tech talent than shedding it,” Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA, says.“The finance and insurance sector had the second highest volume of tech job postings,” Herbert says. For example, companies including [hotlink ignore=true]Humana[/hotlink], Capital One, [hotlink ignore=true]Elevance Health[/hotlink], [hotlink ignore=true]Edward Jones[/hotlink], Citi, [hotlink ignore=true]Travelers[/hotlink], and [hotlink ignore=true]Wells Fargo[/hotlink] are in the top 25 for tech job postings for the month, he says. The highest volume was in the traditional tech job category of professional, scientific, and technical services, with 41,188 job listings, according to the analysis.I asked Herbert if tech job listings for the finance and insurance sector have been on an uptick since January. “Generally, yes, but mirroring the pattern seen in many sectors, there was a significant spike in postings during Q2, resulting in record volumes of hiring activity,” he explains. “Job postings volumes then settled back to more normal ranges. But for the finance and insurance sector, year-to-date aggregate volumes are at 442,147 vs. 326,698 for the same period last year, representing an increase of 35% year over year.”The three employers with the most tech job listings in November were [hotlink]Humana[/hotlink] (4,951), [hotlink]General Dynamics[/hotlink] (3,386), and Capital One (2,716), according to CompTIA’s findings. In comparison, major tech companies like [hotlink]Apple[/hotlink] had 1,791 tech job listings, and [hotlink]Amazon[/hotlink] had 1,516.Story continuesHumana CFO Susan Diamond said on the company’s Q3 2022 earnings call that machine learning techniques played a role in advancing analytic models, and in turn improved sales and retention forecasting. CEO Bruce Broussard mentioned that Humana is creating a culture focused on workflow efficiency and technology adoption.Capital One also pointed to the significance of tech. “One of the real benefits of our tech transformation has been allowing us to build a lot more sophistication, more data, more machine learning, and other things into the credit underwriting process,"" Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said during their Q3 earnings call.Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told ""CBS Mornings” the tech giant is being ""very deliberate"" on hiring. ""That means we're continuing to hire, but not everywhere in the company are we hiring,"" Cook said. Amazon, No. 10 on CompTIA's list may still be hiring, but last month, CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company would begin laying off employees across multiple departments. Amazon joins other Fortune 500 tech companies like Meta and HP Inc. implementing significant layoffs.But as a potential recession is looming, will tech professionals lean toward roles at financial institutions that some might say are less glamorous than a role in Silicon Valley? “It’s tough to say for sure how tech professionals rate their preference for working in different sectors,” Herbert says.But he did offer this piece of advice based on CompTIA's research: ""If companies in the finance and insurance sector can offer compelling tech work along with job stability, work flexibility or career growth, for example, we can reasonably infer tech professionals will consider those job opportunities.""Ways to woo tech professionals, for sure.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comSign up here to receive CFO Daily weekday mornings in your inbox.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

OLLI is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Dec 7 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $431.4 million, indicating an increase of 12.5% from the prior-year quarter.The bottom line of this extreme-value retailer of brand-name merchandise is anticipated to have increased year over year. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share has been stable at 41 cents over the past 30 days. The figure suggests an increase of 20.6% from the year-ago period.The company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 23.2%, on average.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseOllie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseOllie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteOllie's Bargain’s business operating model of “buying cheap and selling cheap,” cost-containment efforts, a focus on store productivity and an expansion of the customer reward program, Ollie's Army, are likely to have contributed to the third-quarter performance.The company has been making efforts to create an alignment between value-driven merchandise and customer demand. Ollie's Bargain is likely to have benefited from a favorable closeout environment and increased trade-down activity.On its last earnings call, management guided third-quarter net sales in the bracket of $426 million-$434 million, up from the $383.5 million reported in the year-ago period. It guided 3.5-5.5% growth in comparable store sales. The company projected third-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of 39-43 cents a share, up from the adjusted earnings of 34 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.However, margins remain an area of concern due to increased supply-chain costs and higher labor costs. Also, SG&amp;A expenses have been increasing for quite some time now. In the last reported quarter, SG&amp;A expenses increased due to the increased number of stores and higher wage rates in select markets.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ollie's Bargain this time.

336,dc943c4d-e48e-326b-8c6e-544557aa9d6d,VRTX,2022-12-06,Genmab AS Sponsored ADR (GMAB) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genmab-sponsored-adr-gmab-hits-141502515.html,1670249702,STORY,"['GMAB.CO', 'VRTX']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Genmab AS Sponsored ADR (GMAB)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $47.5 in the previous session. Genmab AS Sponsored ADR has gained 19% since the start of the year compared to the -15.2% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the -15.1% return for the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 9, 2022, Genmab AS Sponsored ADR reported EPS of $0.53 versus consensus estimate of $0.23 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 13.91%.For the current fiscal year, Genmab AS Sponsored ADR is expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share on $1.86 billion in revenues. This represents a 79.17% change in EPS on a 38.2% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.26 per share on $2.33 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -1.94% and 25.14%, respectively.Valuation MetricsGenmab AS Sponsored ADR may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Genmab AS Sponsored ADR has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 36.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 21.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 59.7X versus its peer group's average of 13.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.38. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Genmab AS Sponsored ADR currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Genmab AS Sponsored ADR fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Genmab AS Sponsored ADR shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does GMAB Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of GMAB have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX). VRTX has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.Earnings were strong last quarter. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated beat our consensus estimate by 8.67%, and for the current fiscal year, VRTX is expected to post earnings of $15.60 per share on revenue of $8.91 billion.Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated have gained 4.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 22X and a P/CF of 25.44X.The Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is in the top 20% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GMAB and VRTX, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""We are ready to equip soldiers with the speed and range they need to compete and win using the most mature, reliable, and affordable high-performance long-range assault weapon system,"" Mitch Snyder, CEO of Bell said in a statement.The Army said the initial award was for $232 million, but the first batch of helicopters in low rate production will be worth $7.1 billion. Ultimately, the contract is potentially worth around $70 billion - over decades - depending on how many the Army and U.S. allies order, the Army told reporters on Monday evening.""The thoughtful and disciplined execution of the FLRAA (Future Long Range Assault Aircraft) program strategy will deliver the transformational capabilities we need to support the Joint force, strengthen deterrence and win in multi-domain operations,"" said Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the army for acquisition, logistics, and technology.In the FLARAA competition was Bell's V-280 ""Valor,"" a tiltrotor aircraft that has reached speeds in excess of 340 mph (547 km) according to the Army. It beat out the entrant from Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky and Boeing Co's SB-1 ""Defiant"" which has two coaxial rotors and a single pusher propeller and has reached speeds of 265 mph, according to the Army.Often defense procurement awards of this magnitude are protested. Bush said ""we planned for that contingency, but that is completely up to the vendor.""

The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Coca-Cola will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Enough Growth For Coca-Cola?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Coca-Cola's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 12% last year. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 26% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 7.3% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.0% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Coca-Cola is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.What We Can Learn From Coca-Cola's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesOur examination of Coca-Cola's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola  that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Coca-Cola.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Best Quality Stocks to Buy Now.During these uncertain times, when the Federal Reserve is on a mission to fight inflation by increasing benchmark interest rates, including the best quality stocks in your portfolio can help protect your savings. The Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) the past four times to a range of 3.75% to 4%. Experts anticipate a further 50 bps hike when the Federal Reserve meets in December. Federal Reserve officials anticipate that the benchmark interest rate will peak around the 4.6% level over the next year. Meanwhile, some hawkish members of the Federal Reserve anticipate the interest rate to peak at around the 7% mark. Experts also believe that earnings could fall by 8% next year due to macroeconomic uncertainty.Amidst the bearish market momentum, it can be difficult to make investments in stocks with strong upside potential. Many analysts think that the quality of a stock can be gauged by its intrinsic value, returns, and earnings quality. However, there is no consensus on one particular basis to gauge quality. Some experts believe that price multiples like price-to-book (P/B) value, price-to-cash flow (P/CF), price-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (P/EBITDA), and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are sound measures to determine the quality of a stock. Furthermore, low volatility in the bottom line, high asset turnover and margins, low level of debt, and low-risk profile can also be considered indicators of high-quality stocks. In line with these metrics, companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are considered some of the best quality stocks in the market currently.11 Best Quality Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyStory continuesWe have shortlisted the 11 best quality stocks based on their business fundamentals and earnings quality. These companies have shown strong growth in earnings on a YoY basis and are expected to help investors yield decent returns in the long term. Furthermore, these companies are blue-chip stocks with sound business models and industry-leading positions. Most of these stocks also offer attractive annual dividend yields as of December 5. The stocks have been ranked using Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds as of Q3 2022.Best Quality Stocks to Buy Now11. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Maryland-based aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with a global presence.The maker of the F-35 fighter has emerged as the biggest contract recipient with the US Department of Defense. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) received $39.2 billion worth of contracts from the Pentagon over the last year. Following the better-than-expected Q3 2022 results and an expanded share buyback plan, Peter J. Arment at Baird upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock from a Neutral to an Outperform rating while maintaining a target price of $513 on October 19.The analyst believes that the company’s ability to generate strong cash flows is still in place, and the strong buyback plan in a volatile market limits the downside potential of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Furthermore, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is expected to be a beneficiary of a ramped-up global defense expenditure at a time when tensions between global powers are high. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.48% as of December 5.Vltava Fund discussed its outlook on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence…” (Click here to see the full text)10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company with a global footprint. The company claims that over 1.9 billion servings of its beverages are consumed across more than 200 countries every day.In a research note issued on October 26, Peter Grom at UBS maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and increased the price target from $63 to $68. The analyst termed the Q3 2022 results as strong and the increase in financial guidance as impressive. This was due to organic growth that was able to offset the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. The analyst believes that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) can trade at a premium against its peers due to the possibility of strong revenue growth in the upcoming quarters. This makes the risk and reward profile of the stock favorable for potential investors. Experts believe that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a price leadership position in the market and an advanced top-line growth management strategy that is expected to provide impetus to the top line. The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) annual dividend yield stands at 2.74% as of December 5.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, shared its stance on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is the third biggest retailer in the world. The Issaquah, Washington-based company operates as a membership-only big box retailer with large warehouses.Analysts at Bank of America added Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock to the 'US 1 List' on November 22. The 'US 1 List' comprises the best investment ideas across all the sectors that are covered by the analysts at Bank of America. Experts believe that retailers like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) will perform strongly through their low-priced private label brands as the consumer is trading down and buying fewer items. The holiday season is expected to provide a boost to the company due to higher consumer spending. Given the raging inflation, people will be looking for value, and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) falls under that category. Furthermore, the company’s membership program is also going strong as the annual renewal rate sits around the 90% mark. The stock's annual payout stands at $3.60, translating into a dividend yield of 0.68% as of December 5.Cooper Investors shared its outlook on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a Beaverton, Oregon-based company known for its footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment with a sports-based theme. The company is at the eighth position on our list of the 11 best quality stocks to buy now.On November 15, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) increased its quarterly dividend by 11% to 34 cents per share. The company is on track to become a member of the Dividend Aristocrat list as it has been raising its annual dividend for the past 15 consecutive years. On October 13, Rick Patel at Raymond James initiated coverage on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) with an Outperform rating and a target price of $99. Although the stock is in the red YTD due to macroeconomic headwinds and industry-specific challenges, the analyst has a long-term bullish take on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Experts believe that the company will continue to grow due to its globally renowned brand, out-of-the-box products, and high growth in emerging markets.Leaven Partners discussed its outlook on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was held by 70 hedge funds at the end of Q3 2022.7. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an Indianapolis, Indiana-based pharmaceutical company founded in 1876. The products of the company are sold in over 120 countries and manufactured in seven countries.Kerry Holford at Berenberg increased the price target on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) from $345 to $375 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock in a research note issued to investors on November 22. The analyst observed that the underlying performance of the large-cap pharma entity is stellar. Furthermore, the early reports regarding the launch of Mounjaro are positive. The injectable for adults suffering from type 2 diabetes has also received a label expansion as a medication against obesity and is expected to roll out by the end of 2023. Experts believe that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is heading towards a favorable setup with the possibility of donanemab providing more upside in treating Alzheimer's. As of December 5, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has an annual forward dividend yield of 1.05%.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was discussed in the Q3 2022 investor letter of ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the firm said:“In the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Brunswick, New Jersey-based pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer goods company. The company is focused on spinning off its consumer goods business as a separate publicly listed entity to focus more on the core pharmaceutical and medical devices segment.To provide impetus to the core business, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has announced the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc.

Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a Dividend King and offers a forward dividend yield of 2.58% as of December 5.Here's what Mayar Capital said about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“J&amp;J is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions.

That's a solid performance by our standards! Unfortunately the longer term returns are not so good, with the stock falling 11% in the last three years.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Incyte In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year Incyte grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 63%. It's fair to say that the share price gain of 29% did not keep pace with the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market isn't as excited about Incyte as it was before.

Although we lowered our exposure to this name, the stock continued its decline as we head into a European winter that will be very challenging for consumers. Both energy and food prices are elevated and there is no relief in sight. We are observing the situation closely but feel the stock more than adequately discounts this risk. The outlook for HAIN in 2023 could be much easier as winter ends and perhaps a political solution is reached in the Ukrainian War.

We had a strong first quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to feel bullish about our momentum and execution across small business and tax. We're innovating at a high velocity using the power of our platform and modern technology capabilities to deliver new offerings at scale focusing on breakthrough adoption. We continue to be focused on putting more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. This is more important than ever in the current uncertain economic environment and helps us penetrate our large total addressable market of over $300 billion.Story continuesNow let's turn to our first quarter results. Revenue grew 29%, including 13 points from the addition of Mailchimp. Total revenue growth was fueled by the Small Business &amp; Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 38% or 19% excluding Mailchimp and 25% revenue growth in the Consumer Group driven by a strong October peak with new customers and extension filers. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see charge volume growth, the number of employees paid, the hours worked per small business and cash reserves. These measures remain strong for those on our platform and inform our perspective on the health of small businesses. TurboTax had a robust finish to the tax season with a record number of innovations launched and tested in the October peak.I'm excited about this upcoming season, particularly our strategy to transform the assisted category, including the launch of Business Tax and TurboTax and Credit Karma platform integrations. Now turning to Credit Karma. At Investor Day and on our fourth quarter call earnings call, we shared that all Credit Karma verticals had been negatively impacted by the macro uncertainty. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into November, we saw further deterioration in all verticals. Consumer default rates remain relatively low by historical standards, reflecting strong consumer cash balances coming out of the pandemic. However, we continue to see partners pull back from extending credit, reflecting the uncertainty in the economic environment and the risk of deterioration in credit performance.Given this context, Credit Karma revenue came in lower than expected for the quarter. We are lowering our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for Credit Karma to a decline of 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 10% to 15% growth. At the same time, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for all other segments and reiterating our fiscal 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance. Our ability to maintain earnings power despite the lower Credit Karma revenue guidance shows the power of our diversified platform and our ability to balance platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our commitments. Regardless of the near-term macro volatility, we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% for Credit Karma driven by our vision and innovation to become the self-driving financial platform fueling prosperity for all consumers.At Investor Day, we shared how our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating our innovation and how our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate our success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across three of these Big Bets. Our first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our Big Bets.Our evolution from a siloed technology stack to a platform leveraging shared capabilities is well underway. Our development environment enables speed and innovation. Engineers now have 6x the velocity of deploying code, resulting in accelerated innovation compared to fiscal year 2020. Our AI and fintech capabilities are well positioned to solve our customers' biggest problems, such as our money innovations across payments and payroll, advancements in TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advance, just to name a few. And we're doing that today with over 730 million AI-driven customer interactions per year, 2 million AI models in production, 58 billion machine learning predictions per day and over $465 billion in money moved during fiscal year 2022.Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customer face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. During the October tax peak, our team launched a record 50 innovations to test and learn. Our learnings can help us transform our go-to-market campaign for the assisted segment; revamp the end-to-end TurboTax Live platform experiences with faster access to money via Credit Karma; and better serve the investor, Latino and self-employed segments. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world.With Mailchimp, we're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have three acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we launched a new brand campaign, refreshed our website and launched an improved first-time use experience for new customers that help them more quickly find and use the feature that aligns with their unique business needs. We also launched a one-hour assisted onboarding process for our high-value Mailchimp customers with the goal of guiding them to more advanced features to increase awareness and usage.This program was launched in a record four weeks by leveraging components of our virtual expert platform, another example of the power of the Intuit platform capabilities. As a result of these enhancements and others, we're seeing a positive impact on customer growth and expansion and a lift in customers converting to pay. Turning to our money portfolio. We've made a tremendous investment over the last few years to expand our suite of money offerings to help small businesses get paid, pay others and access capital and manage their money. We continue to see strength in our charge volume driven by easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront. This quarter, we made it even easier for more customers to access their cash quickly by removing friction and opening the funnel to more customers.We're also rolling out a new invoicing experience with a more streamlined workflow and improved design, which is driving an increase in the percentage of companies that send payment-enabled invoices. Looking ahead, we're tackling another big challenge for our small business customers, B2B payments. More than $2 trillion of invoices were managed in QuickBooks in fiscal year 2022. As we shared at Investor Day, we are launching the QuickBooks Business Network, which connects small business customers each other, making it easier for them to do business. It's currently in beta testing, and we expect to launch more broadly later this fiscal year. We're also building our own bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future.We're excited about our opportunities for growth with Mailchimp and payments becoming the center of small business growth. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy and the power of our platform. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever for our customers. We have a large TAM with low penetration, secular shifts working in our favor, a diversified large-scale platform where we continue to invest heavily in innovation across our 5 Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers, resulting in top line growth and margin expansion. We're proud to be an employer of choice as well as the financial technology platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper.Now let me hand it over to Michelle.See also 12 Best Blockchain Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Coffee Stocks To Buy.Michelle Clatterbuck: Thanks, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $76 million versus $195 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $662 million versus $555 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.14 versus $0.82 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.53 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business &amp; Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 38% during the quarter and 19% on an organic basis, excluding $264 million in Mailchimp revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 60% in Q1 or 28% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business &amp; Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 29% in Q1 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 109% in Q1. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 28%. Mailchimp revenue included in online services was $264 million, up low teens versus a year ago, in line with our expectations. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth.Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, and we began to execute our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 172% in Q1 and 19% on an organic basis excluding Mailchimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. As a reminder, the subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with QBO pricing. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits during the quarter. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. Moving on to Credit Karma.Revenue grew 2% to $425 million in Q1. This was below our expectations of mid-single-digit growth we shared at Investor Day due to further deterioration in all verticals the last few weeks of the quarter. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards, offset by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans. As the macro environment continues to remain uncertain, we're seeing an impact across all verticals. Sasan touched on this briefly earlier, but let me unpack what we're seeing. In credit cards, many financial institution partners have tightened eligibility, particularly in riskier segments. In personal loans, we saw continued pressure with many partners tightening eligibility further while increasing APRs. We continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022.As a result, we are reducing our fiscal 2023 Credit Karma revenue guidance to a decline of 15% to 10%. This embeds the current trends we're seeing and additional conservatism in the remainder of the year despite the expected continued rollout of several new innovations. Consumer Group revenue was $150 million, reflecting a strong finish to the tax season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted category in the tax prep market as we head into the next tax season. We're focused on making TurboTax a compelling destination for filers who prefer assistance to complete their taxes accurately and quickly. Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue of $34 million was in line with our expectations. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged.We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $7 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable January 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared last quarter, we have an operating system we use to run the Company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth.The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. As Sasan shared earlier, we are reiterating our operating income and earnings per share expectations for fiscal year 2023 despite our lower revenue expectations for Credit Karma. We're able to do this by reducing spend in areas where we expect to see lower returns near term. Last quarter, I mentioned we identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios, and the adjustments we have made are an example. Given the breadth of our offerings and the power of our diversified platform, we have the ability to maintain earnings power despite our expectation for lower Credit Karma revenue.At the same time, we have the ability to make the necessary platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our short- and long-term commitments. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our revenue guidance for Credit Karma as trends in all verticals further deteriorated in the last few weeks of the quarter and into November. We now expect revenue to decline 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance range of 10% to 15% revenue growth. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for all other segments and now expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12% versus the previous range of 14% to 16%.For the Small Business &amp; Self-Employed Group, we continue to expect 19% to 20% revenue growth. And for the Consumer Group, we continue to expect 9% to 10% revenue growth. In both businesses, we expect the majority of our growth this year to come from customer growth and mix. We are reiterating our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2023. This demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified platform and business model. So to recap, for fiscal year 2023, we expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%.Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP loss per share of $0.29 to $0.23, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.45. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.Sasan Goodarzi: Great. Thank you, Michelle. As you all heard from Michelle and I, we're seeing continued momentum as a result of our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform, growing Intuit double digits with margin expansion.

Granted, a large part of this has been due to unprofitable biotech startups that went public at sky-high prices and then tanked, but even the big pharma companies haven't been doing too hot for the most part.Why Stryker Has Greatly Outperformed Its SectorWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SYK. Click here to check it out. SYK 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SYKPeter Lynch Chart of SYKYet, shares of Stryker Corp. (NYSE:SYK) have declined by just 4% over this same period.Why Stryker Has Greatly Outperformed Its SectorThis speaks to the strength of the company and its leadership in the industry. Lets dig deeper into the company to see why Stryker has outperformed its sector by such a wide margin.Takeaways from recent earnings resultsStryker reported third-quarter earnings figures on Oct. 31, with the company showing mixed results. Revenue grew 7.7% to $4.48 billion and topped estimates by $16 million. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.12 compared unfavorably to $2.20 in the prior year and was 11 cents below expectations.This follows on the heals of the second quarter, where the company missed on both the top and bottom lines. Considering how the market tends to treat results that dont live up to expectations, it can be argued that Strykers stock should be much lower than it is. But shares are higher by almost 18% in the last three months even as the company has turned in disappointing or mixed headline numbers.It would appear that not only is the market giving Stryker the benefit of the doubt, but investors are looking past just what was reported over the past few quarters and are bidding up shares.There are several reasons why this has taken place. Over the long-term, Stryker has been very consistent at growing revenue, and earnings growth has been high at nearly 12% annually over the last decade.Why Stryker Has Greatly Outperformed Its SectorCurrency exchange has been a headwind all year for Stryker, with the most recent quarter seeing a stronger U.S. dollar lowering reported sales by 3.7%. Management now expects that unfavorable currency exchange rates, along with ongoing supply chain constraints, to be a 35 cent to 40 cent impairment to adjusted earnings per share for 2022. This compares to prior guidance of a headwind of 25 cents to 30 cents and 10 cents to 15 cents.Story continuesAccordingly, Stryker lowered its forecast for the rest of the year, with the company now expecting to produce adjusted earnings per share of $9.15 to $9.25 for 2022. This is down from prior guidance of $9.30 to $9.50 and $9.60 to $10.00.Looking beyond this, third-quarter results were actually more of what investors have come to expect from Stryker. Organic growth was 9.9% for the period, including a 10.8% increase for MedSurg and Neurotechnology and an 8.7% improvement for Orthopaedics and Spine. A slight increase in prices in MedSurg and Neurotechnology didnt hurt demand as volume grew almost 10%. Orthopaedics and Spine had a 2.9% decrease in pricing, but this was more than offset by an 11.6% increase in volume. Helping results was the fact that elective procedures are normalizing in most regions, outside of China, which still has strict Covid-19 policies in place.U.S. organic sales were higher by 9.2% while international was up 11.8%. In both segments, international growth ran ahead of domestic gains. Due to the gains in the most recent quarter, Stryker raised its guidance for organic growth to 8.5% to 9.0%, up from 8% to 9% and 6% to 8% previously.Many areas of the business are seeing growth. For example, Mako installations were down for the period, but hip and knee procedures were up double-digits as the recovery of elective procedures continues. Stryker is also expanding its reach for Mako, with applications for spine and shoulder in development. If successful, the addition of these areas for use with Mako will greatly expand the devices reach. Mako has a very impressive customer retention rate of 99%.Other businesses experienced double-digit organic growth, including Endoscopy, Sports Medicine and Medical. The latter grew even as supply chain issues impacted emergency care products. New product offerings drove a 10.4% improvement in Trauma and Extremities in the U.S.Higher labor costs and the acquisition of electronic components at higher market prices led to a 370-basis point contraction in adjusted gross margin to 62.6%. A tight labor market has meant employers paying more for workers, and the lack of electronic components has meant price increases for these goods. The good news is that perhaps the worst of this impact on the gross margin is occurring, as the adjusted grow margin was lower by 70 basis points sequentially.Another reason Stryker likely has gotten a reprieve from the market is its long history of making acquisitions to augment the companys foothold in its areas of operation. The most recent addition was completed in February, when Stryker acquired Vocera Communications for $3.1 billion. Vocera offers software and hardware needed for remote communications, which will compliment Strykers advanced digital health care business. Stryker has been aggressive on the acquisition front, folding in 16 separate businesses over the last five years.While the reduction in guidance for the second time this year is disappointing, it is mostly due to the impact of currency exchange. The underlying businesses have performed quite well as evidenced by the increase in guidance of organic revenue growth. Most businesses continue to act well as the pace of elective surgeries continues to improve and are almost back to pre-Covid-19 levels. In the short-term, a strong U.S. dollar could limit earnings growth, but the overall strength of Strykers product portfolio remains near the top of the medical device industry.Valuation analysisStryker has a GF Score of 92 out of 100, implying the potential for outperformance going forward based on a historical study from GuruFocus. The company receives high scores for growth, profitability and momentum that are offset by weaker scores for value and financial strength.Why Stryker Has Greatly Outperformed Its SectorUsing revised guidance for the year, Stryker is trading with a forward price-earnings ratio of just over 26. According to Value Line, the 10-year average price-earnings ratio is 25.8, so shares of Stryker are close to their long-term average valuation.The GF Value chart shows that the stock is trading at a slight discount to fair value.Why Stryker Has Greatly Outperformed Its SectorWith a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.91, shares could return 10.4% if they were to reach their GF Value. This would be in addition to the current dividend yield of 1.2%, which is on the low side, but has been increased for almost three decades.Final thoughtsStryker has been negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar, worker shortages and supply chain constraints, which has led to the lowering of guidance for 2022. And yet, shares have surged over the last three months and are barely down over the last year. This stands in stark opposition to the health care sector as a whole.The stock has performed so well because the company has a long track record of growth and has seen organic sales results that have been very high. Most individual areas of the company are performing well, something that should continue as the number of elective procedures improve to be more in line with pre-pandemic figures.Even after the gain in the last three months, shares of Stryker sit just near their long-term average price-earnings ratio and the stock could still see double-digit returns if it were to reach its GF Value. For investors looking for exposure to the medical device industry, I believe Stryker could represent an excellent name to consider.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Airbnb Inc. ABNB, Datadog Inc. DDOG, Fortinet Inc. FTNT, Paycom Software Inc. PAYC and VeriSign Inc. VRSN.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Tech Majors to Buy on the Dip for Gains in 2023Just four weeks of trading are left to complete a terrible 2022, in which the technology sector has suffered the most. The technology sector, which enabled Wall Street to get rid of the coronavirus-induced short bear market and formed the new bull market, has suffered since the beginning of this year as most market participants were extremely concerned about the sector’s overvaluation in the last two years.As 2022 progressed, 40-year high inflation in the United States, Fed’s ultra-hawkish monetary tightening with a record-high interest rate to combat inflation and concerns about a near-term recession resulted in a sharp decline in the technology sector’s valuation.The Technology Select Sector SPDR — one of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index — has tumbled 22.2% year to date. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has plunged 26.7% year to date and is currently in a bear market.Consequently, the technology sector is no longer overvalued. Moreover, it seems that peak inflation is behind us as indicated by several measures of inflation in October. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent comment about a possible lowering of the magnitude of interest rate hike in December FOMC meeting will be highly advantageous for this sector.At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in large-cap (market capital &gt; $20 billion) technology stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank for gains in 2023.Story continuesTechnology is the Best Bet for the Long TermThe recent meltdown of the technology sector is a temporary phenomenon. The fundamentals of this sector are rock solid. We must not forget that the growing demand for hi-tech products has been a catalyst for the sector in an otherwise tough environment. A series of breakthroughs in 5G wireless network, cloud computing, predictive analysis, AI, self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and IoT, has given a boost to the overall space.Tech Has Vast Potential — Buy on the DipThe leading emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Africa and some European countries are still way behind in using digital technology compared to the developed world. While mobile phone penetration is nearly 90% in these countries, a large number of people are still using phones with old features, since voice communication and not data serve most of their needs. Even those using smartphones, rarely utilize online digital features.  However, the outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and lookout of these people. People were not entirely used to digital platforms for their office work (work from home), ordering food and other daily needs or transferring money and making payments. Moreover, online schooling, video conferencing and virtual networking have now become essential.The countries that are more digitized have been able to minimize their losses during the pandemic. These are major lessons for other countries. Even those who are less inclined toward digital technology and online platforms, either because they have to learn using smartphones or tablets or due to fear of data theft, are now feeling the massive advantage of online platforms.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap technology stocks with attractive valuations.

361,05b1d0e5-f404-324f-aba3-a1220c51f7d2,CINF,2022-12-06,"With 72% ownership, Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/72-ownership-cincinnati-financial-corporation-131524077.html,1670246124,STORY,['CINF'],"[If you want to know who really controls Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cincinnati Financial. View our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cincinnati Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Cincinnati Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cincinnati Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cincinnati Financial. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and Aristotle Capital Management, LLC holds about 6.1% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cincinnati FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Cincinnati Financial Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$504m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cincinnati Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Cincinnati Financial   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Progressive The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ProgressiveOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, for US$2.4m worth of shares, at about US$126 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$131). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's stake.In the last year Progressive insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Progressive Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Progressive. Specifically, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan ditched US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of ProgressiveMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$240m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Progressive that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

PBR, Cboe Global Markets CBOE and UnitedHealth Group, Inc. UNH.3 Top-Ranked Companies with Supercharged Dividend GrowthStocks extended their strength in last week’s session, with the indexes penciling in their second consecutive weekly close in green territory.Although Friday’s better-than-expected Employment Situations Report brought some volatility and uncertainty to the market, investors can, at least, celebrate the recent streak of green.In the historically-volatile market we’ve been accustomed to in 2022, dividends have quickly become a precious item for investors, helping to soften the impact of drawdowns in other positions.And over the years, several companies have grown their dividend payouts notably.Three top-ranked companies that have increasingly rewarded their shareholders – Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., Cboe Global Markets and UnitedHealth Group, Inc. – could all be considerations for investors with an appetite for income.On top of strong dividend growth, all three stocks have displayed remarkable relative strength in 2022, outperforming the general market handily. Let’s take a closer look at each one.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (or Petrobras S.A.) is Brazil’s largest integrated energy firm, with operations in the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and gas. The company sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s annual dividend currently yields a staggering 30.3%, crushing its Zacks Oils and Energy sector average of an already impressive 4.3%.Further, the company has upped its dividend payout 11 times over the last five years, translating to a 145% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.PBR’s free cash flow has recovered nicely from 2020 lows of $4.1 billion, reported at $10.6 billion in its latest earnings release.Story continuesUnitedHealth Group, Inc.UnitedHealth provides a wide range of healthcare products and services, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs. UNH sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).UNH’s annual dividend currently yields approximately 1.2%, a tick below its Zacks Medical sector average of 1.3%.While the yield is lower than its sector’s average, the company’s 17.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Like PBR, UnitedHealth’s free cash flow growth is hard to ignore; UNH reported free cash flow of $17.8 billion in its latest release, good enough for a 150% Y/Y uptick and an even more impressive 180% sequential increase.And for the cherry on top, UnitedHealth carries a strong growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar nearly 16% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 13% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 12.5% in FY22 and 10.3% in FY23.Cboe Global Markets, Inc.By volume, Cboe Global Markets is one of the largest stock exchange operators in the United States and a leading market globally for ETP trading.Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company’s earnings outlook as of late, pushing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).As it stands, CBOE’s annual dividend currently yields roughly 1.6%, modestly below its Zacks Finance sector average of 2.3%.Still, CBOE has been dedicated to growing its payout, bolstered by its 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Bottom LineWe’re all very aware that it’s been a challenging market landscape in 2022, with a hawkish Fed, geopolitical issues, and lingering COVID-19 uncertainties spoiling the fun.It’s common for investors to target dividend-paying stocks during times of heightened volatility, as the payouts provide a passive income stream and cushion drawdowns in other positions.Of course, it’s beneficial to target companies with a track record of increasing their payouts, such as what Petroleo Brasileiro, Cboe Global and UnitedHealth Group have all done over the last five years.In addition, all three stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating that their near-term business outlook has turned positive, undoubtedly a strong pairing.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

PBR, Cboe Global Markets CBOE, and UnitedHealth Group, Inc. UNH have all done over the last five years.In addition, all three stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating that their near-term business outlook has turned positive, undoubtedly a strong pairing.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Estée Lauder Companies'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:35% = US$2.2b ÷ US$6.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.35 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Estée Lauder Companies' Earnings Growth And 35% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Estée Lauder Companies has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 18% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Estée Lauder Companies was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Estée Lauder Companies' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 18% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is EL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Estée Lauder Companies Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 35% (implying that the company retains 65% of its profits), it seems that Estée Lauder Companies is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Estée Lauder Companies has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 37%. Regardless, the future ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is predicted to rise to 55% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Estée Lauder Companies' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

If you want to see more best Jim Cramer stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.Jim Cramer is a famous TV personality who hosts the show Mad Money. He is also an anchor on Squawk on the Street. Before TV, Jim Cramer ran a hedge fund, Cramer Berkowitz, that did pretty well. In its 14 years, his hedge fund averaged annual returns of 24%.In terms of his TV picks, Cramer hasn't been as successful as his hedge fund as he often recommends many different stocks across the stock market. As such, it's almost impossible for Cramer to be significantly above average. Investing successfully is more about swinging at good pitches rather than swinging at a ton of pitches. Nevertheless, Cramer can still be informative.In terms of his picks, Jim Cramer has recommended many different stocks. Given blue chips have historically performed better in the long term, this article will focus more on Jim Cramer's blue chip recommendations.In terms of Jim Cramer's recent commentary, he had the following comment about the market and his investing club, ""Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson says he has seen enough of the rally, and he says it’s time to bail. There’s less than 2% upside at the high end of his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 4,000 to 4,150. Stay with defensive stocks and utilities. The industrials have been carrying the market. I wrote about some of the hot old-school stocks lately and how we’re playing the sector for the Club.'2022 has been a volatile year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for many companies is lower than what it was before and broader market valuations have declined as capital has moved from equities to the Treasuries.Although inflation is showing signs of potentially peaking, many investors believe the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises rates too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a recession next year and the fundamentals of even blue chips could weaken. There could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations. As such, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that Jim Cramer has recommended before.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now10.

(Nasdaq: SRCL), a leading provider of medical waste management and secure information destruction solutions, today released its second annual Healthcare Workplace Safety Trend Report revealing crucial insights into healthcare workers' perspectives on health and safety in their work environments. Industry growth and the changing landscape of infectious diseases is driving a significant transformation of healthcare, while creating new challenges to overcome. The study aimed to better understand healthcare providers' and administrators' perspectives on those challenges to help healthcare organizations improve workplace safety standards as well as create a quality care environment for providers and their patients.Stericycle, Inc. (PRNewsfoto/Stericycle)This year's key findings found healthcare providers have an increased desire for more training, tools and resources around regulated and pharmaceutical waste management (79%, up from 56% in 2021), at-home care disposal (91%), and managing difficult patients (72%). Both providers and administrators also see a clear connection between their workplace's sustainable environmental practices and the overall health of the community and positive patient outcomes. Nine in ten (94%) healthcare providers and administrators believe improper medical waste disposal greatly impacts patient health and safety and puts the physical safety of providers at risk – a 23% increase from 2021.""Healthcare organizations are facing immense challenges when it comes to protecting the health and well-being of their patients and staff. Recent public health emergencies from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases have only intensified issues facing the healthcare industry, including increasing workloads, longer hours, and less staff,"" said Cory White, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Stericycle. ""Our findings emphasize the need for healthcare organizations to create an ecosystem of care that nurtures and prioritizes patient and provider health, community health and environmental health, which will help lessen these industry challenges and define the future of healthcare. Our report also provides actionable steps to help healthcare organizations create a healthier and safer environment for their workers and patients.""Story continuesAdditional key themes and insights from the report include:Healthcare Professionals Remain Stressed and Burnt-out: While stress levels decreased from 2021, they remain high with nearly three in five providers (58%) still noting their day-to-day stress level has worsened in the past year, citing increasing workloads, longer hours and decreasing staff as the largest stress contributors. More than a quarter feel unmotivated (34%), have trouble concentrating (28%), and are concerned about their physical safety (25%).Effective Healthcare Environments Require Medical Waste Management: Both providers (93%) and administrators (84%) agree that medical waste management is important to delivering the best possible care to patients. The majority of providers (94%) also stated that the absence of proper regulated medical/ biohazardous waste disposal puts the physical safety of healthcare workers at risk, an increase of 12% from 2021.Waste Challenges of At-Home Care: Providers (69%) and administrators (78%) agree that there are not enough standards in place to safely remove medical waste from at-home care. Nearly six in ten providers say patients do not know how to dispose of medical waste safely (59%, up from 26% in 2021), nor do they have adequate tools and resources available (58%, up from 37% in 2021) in at-home care settings. Almost all providers (91%) agree that they need additional training to uphold safe working conditions in at-home care settings.Medical Waste Critically Impacts Communities: Ninety-five percent of healthcare providers and administrators agree that improper medical and biohazardous waste management is harmful to the environment, and more than half of providers (56%) and administrators (67%) reported they think about the environmental impacts of regulated medical and biohazardous waste often. This environmental and community concern includes drug diversion, where 53% of providers agree that improperly disposed of pharmaceutical waste is one of the biggest contributors to the opioid epidemic.The Future of Healthcare Lies in Home Care: While most healthcare providers (90%) expect the rate of at-home care to increase over the next five years, they are concerned about their risks to physical health and well-being (75%). Those concerns include sanitation (53%), availability of resources (52%), and their own safety in at-home care settings (50%).This study surveyed 504 healthcare professionals—404 healthcare practitioners (those who have direct patient interaction and currently practice as a physician, nurse or another related role) and 100 administrators (those who are currently at an executive leadership or senior management level in a healthcare organization). Both audiences were required to work in an organization that deals with medical waste management in some regard, whether they are personally responsible for decision making or not.For more information about Stericycle and to access the Healthcare Workplace Safety Trend Report and multimedia assets, visit Stericycle's website.About StericycleStericycle, Inc., (Nasdaq: SRCL) is a U.S. based business-to-business services company and leading provider of compliance-based solutions that protect peoples and brands, promotes health and well-being, and safeguards the environment.

(NYSE: SLG), Manhattan’s largest office landlord, announced today that its board of directors has reduced the annual ordinary dividend on SL Green’s common stock and units of its operating partnership by 12.9%, to $3.25 per share. The ordinary dividend will continue to be paid in cash on a monthly basis. The first monthly ordinary dividend of $0.2708 per share is payable on January 17, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 30, 2022 (the “Record Date”).“We endeavor to provide our shareholders with a meaningful, sustainable ordinary dividend that has a correlation to operating cash flow while furthering our initiative to maintain substantial liquidity and repay debt amid the backdrop of a rising rate environment. We have reduced the dividend to match our current projection of Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”) for 2023, which allows us to strike this balance as we continue to provide a yield on our common stock of approximately 8.0%, based on the current share price, while projecting an increase in liquidity to nearly $1.6 billion and a reduction of combined debt by almost $2.4 billion during 2023,” said Matt DiLiberto, Chief Financial Officer.About SL Green Realty Corp.SL Green Realty Corp., Manhattan's largest office landlord, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is focused primarily on acquiring, managing and maximizing value of Manhattan commercial properties.

That means the maximum your employer will give you is $3,600 each year.But if you only put $2,000 into your 401(k), your employer is only putting in $2,000 — and you’re leaving $1,600 on the table.Story continuesOpportunities like these don’t come around often in life, and yet 17.5 million Americans are guilty of not cashing in on the full offer they receive, according to a survey by MagnifyMoney.How will the Secure Act 2.0 change things?It’s not like retirement saving isn’t important to Americans, with 71% of people calling “living comfortably in retirement” a top life goal in a 2022 Principal Financial Group survey.Yet roughly half of Americans aren’t confident their savings are enough or have confidence in their retirement planning.Under the Secure Act 2.0, workers will be automatically enrolled in a 401(k) at a contribution rate of 3% of their pay. Assuming you don’t opt out, the contribution rate would then increase by 1% annually until it hits a maximum of 10%.Read more: 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)The legislation also expands what you can do with your 401(k) contributions, and many employers are buying in.A 2022 survey of over 360 employers by business advisory firm WTW found 38% plan to allow employees to divert their contributions to things like reducing student loan debt, adding to emergency savings or topping up a health savings account — all while still receiving a company match on those amounts.About 28% of employers surveyed also plan to boost their plans by doing things like increasing the automatic deferral amount.Why don’t people contribute more?The Principal survey says 62% of workers list employer-match contributions as a top criteria for reaching their retirement goals.But when it comes to knowing about and contributing to 401(k) plans, the MagnifyMoney survey shows a small number of respondents say they don’t understand how these retirement plans work (6%) or don’t know whether their company offers a match (17%).Some employees (12%) say they want to wait until they’re older to contribute. But as any financial expert will tell you, contributing as soon as possible is critical since it gives your investments more time to grow.The biggest reason why employees don’t take full advantage is affordability; over a third of respondents to the MagnifyMoney survey say they just can’t contribute as much as they’d like. That makes sense, especially at a time when many families’ budgets are being stretched to the breaking point.How to start taking full advantageWhen this much money is on the line, you’ll want to set up a talk with your HR representative right away.Prioritizing your 401(k) over other saving and investing options is often a smart move, at least until you max out your company match. One exception could be building up your emergency savings — in a crisis, pulling money out of a 401(k) early can trigger costly penalties.WATCH NOW: Video: Suze Orman says cash-strapped Americans should never tap their 401(k)If you’ve got enough money to spare, your first step should be setting up automatic withdrawals from your paycheck. A “set-it-and-forget-it” approach will ensure you get the maximum match.Keep in mind that the new legislation means you could have multiple options for what you do with your contributions in the future.Remember you can always invest more than the amount your employer will match. And since these automatic withdrawals typically come from your pre-tax income, you won’t need to pay taxes on your contributions.Still have questions? Ask an expertIt's not always easy to make sure you're getting the most out of your 401(k) plan and any other retirement accounts.Setting yourself up for a comfortable retirement is nerve-wracking — especially with a 7.7% inflation rate and potential recession peeking around the corner.One solution to help you sleep better: find a financial adviser who can help navigate your finances and make sure your assets are safeguarded.Researching and calling multiple financial planners can be a time-consuming hassle, but there are ways you can easily browse vetted advisers that fit your needs. Booking a consultation is free and only takes a few minutes.If you're unsure of how to safeguard your savings during a recession, the time to find a financial adviser is now.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Federal Realty Investment Trust Federal Realty Investment Trust Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Board David Faeder made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$95.87 each. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$109), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFederal Realty Investment Trust is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Federal Realty Investment TrustI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 1.0% of Federal Realty Investment Trust shares, worth about US$88m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The Federal Realty Investment Trust Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Federal Realty Investment Trust insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares.

AWK has announced that its unit, New Jersey American Water, will invest $2 million to replace nearly 2 miles of aging water mains in Voorhees, NJ.New Jersey American Water will replace the old water mains installed during the 1950s with new 8-inch ductile iron mains. The proper upgrade and maintenance of water mains will ensure an adequate potable water supply to its customers.The replacement project also includes replacing 11 fire hydrants and 111 utility-owned service lines along the pipeline route. These additional changes will ensure a better flow of water for consumers and fire-fighters during emergency situations.Aging Infrastructure – A ConcernPer the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”), water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States.It is evident from the findings of ASCE that a substantial portion of the U.S. water infrastructure has aged and is nearing the end of its effective service life. The ASCE has given a D+ grade to the overall U.S. water and wastewater infrastructure. The repair and upgrade of miles of aging pipelines are essential for maintaining quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water services.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water pipelines and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure, like overhead storage tanks and water purifying units, needs maintenance at proper intervals.Utilities Making Systematic InvestmentGiven the above-mentioned scenario, it is evident that systematic investments to upgrade and maintain the old infrastructure and make provisions for adding new infrastructure will assist the operators in meeting the rising customer demand. Water utilities are making systematic investments to replace and upgrade their aging infrastructure.American Water plans to invest $14-$15 billion between 2023 and 2027 along with $30-$34 billion between 2023 and 2032 to upgrade and strengthen the existing water and wastewater infrastructure. Water utilities like California Water Service Group CWT, Essential Utilities WTRG and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructures.California Water Service has more than $1 billion in capital expenditure planned for 2022-2024. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CWT’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 22.6%. The current dividend yield of California Water Service is 1.6%.Essential Utilities aims to invest $3 billion through 2024 to strengthen its water and natural gas operations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG’s 2022 and 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 6.5%, respectively. The long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth of WTRG is currently pegged at 6.1%. The current dividend yield of Essential Utilities is 2.4%.Middlesex Water plans to invest $229 million during 2022-2024 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.

384,f07e3544-d6d2-31f7-af25-cd1dae96f6fe,FCX,2022-12-06,3 Non Ferrous Metal Mining Stocks to Watch in a Challenging Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-non-ferrous-metal-mining-131401016.html,1670246041,STORY,"['HG=F', 'SI=F', 'GC=F', 'FCX', '^GSPC', 'FQVLF', 'SCCO']","[The prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak as apprehensions about slowing demand and economic activity have been weighing down commodity prices. Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy as well as labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, Southern Copper Corporation SCCO and First Quantum Minerals FQVLF. These are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process. Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit followed by assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly precede actual mining. The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of an Economic Slowdown Weighing on Commodity Prices: Copper prices have declined for most part of this year due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession. Silver prices have also been negatively impacted this year, thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Gold prices also felt the pressure of a rallying dollar and Treasury yields. However, recently, metal prices have found support amid expectations of a pickup in industrial demand as Fed Chair Powell signaled that the central bank may slow the pace of rate hikes this month. Concerns of low supply are also aiding prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies. Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance: The industry players are currently dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future given their wide usage in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials. Demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy are expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals. While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 19% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Union Pacific UNP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern NSC.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Biden Intervention Averts Rail StrikeOn Dec 2, President Joe Biden signed the resolution to avoid a rail strike, thereby bringing relief to the U.S. economy, which is already reeling under high inflation and supply chain issues. Unions and railroad companies like Union Pacific, CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern had time till Dec 9 to iron out differences and reach an agreement to avoid a strike. With the President signing the bill that would make a rail strike illegal, that damaging possibility has been put to rest.All the abovementioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We remind investors that stocks in the railroad space have been hitherto hit hard by headwinds like supply-chain woes, labor woes and high fuel costs. Due to supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity, overall volumes declined 2% year over year at Norfolk Southern in third-quarter 2022.While releasing the third-quarter 2022 results, management at Union Pacific trimmed its carload growth (volumes) outlook for the current year to around 3% from the 4-5% band expected earlier. The high inflation-induced rise in interest rates, which may lead to an economic slowdown, resulted in the outlook cut. Also, now UNP expects 2022 operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) to be around 60%. Earlier the expectation was for the ratio to be around 58%. Lower the ratio, the better. The unfavorable forecast can be attributed to economic uncertainty. Supply-chain woes and escalated expenses on fuel also resulted in the deterioration of the operating ratio at another railroad operator — CSX Corporation — in the September quarter.Story continuesIf thestrike had materialized, the supply-chain woes would have been further aggravated, in turn, dealing a huge blow to customers already suffering from sky-high inflation. A nationwide railroad strike would have hit the economy very hard. The work stoppage by railroad workers was estimated to have cost the already fragile economy more than $2 billion a day.No wonder, the President was a relieved man, before signing the bill he said, “The bill I’m about to sign ends a difficult rail dispute and helps our nation avoid what, without a doubt, would have been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar.”With the damaging strike being averted let’s have a look back and recapture the related events.A strike by U.S. railroad workers had been looming large ever since workers at the largest rail union in the United States voted against a provisional deal reached in September this year. The rejection was due to the absence of a clause pertaining to granting of paid sick leave to workers in the railroad industry. The deal, however, included 24% compounded wage hike over the 2020-2024 period and five annual lump sum payments amounting to $1,000, per a Reuters report.With the specter of a rail strike looming, that would cripple the economy, the President intervened to thwart that damaging possibility. Accordingly, the House voted 290 to 137 on Nov 30 for imposing the tentative deal reached in September. The same was passed by the Senate (80-15) a day later. Following approval by the House and the Senate, the President signed the legislation to block the rail strike. However, the Senate failed to approve a measure pertaining to paid sick leave.What’s Ahead?While it is clear that there will be no rail strike, the fact remains that the major area of dispute – regarding paid sick leaves, is still unresolved. However, on the contentious issue, the President has said ""That fight isn't over."" While unions demand the presence of paid sick leave, railroad companies like UNP, CSX and NSC are totally opposed to the inclusion of the clause as it would increase their labor costs, Given this backdrop. we expect investors to follow the updates on this burning issue in the coming days.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

If you want to see more best Jim Cramer stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.Jim Cramer is a famous TV personality who hosts the show Mad Money. He is also an anchor on Squawk on the Street. Before TV, Jim Cramer ran a hedge fund, Cramer Berkowitz, that did pretty well. In its 14 years, his hedge fund averaged annual returns of 24%.In terms of his TV picks, Cramer hasn't been as successful as his hedge fund as he often recommends many different stocks across the stock market. As such, it's almost impossible for Cramer to be significantly above average. Investing successfully is more about swinging at good pitches rather than swinging at a ton of pitches. Nevertheless, Cramer can still be informative.In terms of his picks, Jim Cramer has recommended many different stocks. Given blue chips have historically performed better in the long term, this article will focus more on Jim Cramer's blue chip recommendations.In terms of Jim Cramer's recent commentary, he had the following comment about the market and his investing club, ""Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson says he has seen enough of the rally, and he says it’s time to bail. There’s less than 2% upside at the high end of his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 4,000 to 4,150. Stay with defensive stocks and utilities. The industrials have been carrying the market. I wrote about some of the hot old-school stocks lately and how we’re playing the sector for the Club.'2022 has been a volatile year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for many companies is lower than what it was before and broader market valuations have declined as capital has moved from equities to the Treasuries.Although inflation is showing signs of potentially peaking, many investors believe the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises rates too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a recession next year and the fundamentals of even blue chips could weaken. There could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations. As such, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 10 stocks with competitive advantages that Jim Cramer has recommended before.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now10.

BOL was awarded a $3.8 million-dollar grant from the Quest Diagnostics Foundation as part of Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE), a multi-year initiative of Quest Diagnostics and the Quest Foundation focused on providing a combination of donated testing services, education programs, and funding to support initiatives to close the gap in healthcare disparities in underserved communities across the U.S.""The Quest Foundation is proud to announce the Bread of Life Health Houston Collective, one of our largest commitments to date through our Quest for Health Equity initiative,"" said Michael Prevoznik, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Co-Executive Sponsor of Q4HE, Quest Diagnostics. ""At Quest we are fond of saying that health care is a team sport. We know that no one entity alone will be able to close the gaps in health care and we are committed to working together to help address critical health issues for underserved communities in Houston.""Story continuesFunds will support the BOL Healthy Houston Collective, which is a multi-year initiative focused on addressing healthcare disparities in underserved communities in Houston and Harris County through four program areas: the Community Care Program, the Bread of Life Academy and Eco-Life Staffing, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) collaborations, and the Community Based Organization (CBO) Regranting Program.""The Healthy Houston Collective will help underserved Houston communities bridge the gap between the residents and the health care system that so often leaves the community behind,"" said Pastor Yvette Tarrant, CEO, Bread of Life, Inc. ""We are currently in a public health crisis and I'm happy and hopeful to be joining forces with Quest to bring health services, training for healthcare workers, testing and job opportunities to under-resourced communities.""The Community Care Program utilizes certified Community Health Workers who live within underserved communities to help connect their neighbors to the healthcare system. While they are not doctors or healthcare professionals, they serve as powerful advocates. The Community Health Workers will work with and empower individuals by addressing social determinant barriers and support with long-term health gains through health education and connections to services.Through the Community Care Program, BOL is collaborating with the Patient Care Intervention Center, a nonprofit organization that leverages technology, health data sharing, and public health best practices to empower patients and providers to achieve enduring health outcomes and financial sustainability. This data driven approach will be used to develop specific strategies to improve patients' outcomes.""Seventy percent of our health is influenced by things we are not always aware of; things like education, employment, economic stability and access,"" said Dr. Sarah Simmons, Director of Health Outcomes, Bread of Life, Inc. ""The Healthy Houston Collective is our solution to make an impact in our community, through strong community partnerships we will be able to collaborate to utilize the great resources that already exist in Houston and make them available to the people who need them.""In conjunction with the University of Houston Community Health Worker Initiative, the Bread of Life Academy for health careers provides training for phlebotomists and community health workers. This affords graduates stable employment opportunities and supports the local healthcare system needs. These graduates will receive additional support from the community partner Community Care Cooperative to offer ownership and economic mobility opportunities. Quest has also paved the way for certified Community Health Workers to help supplement 75 Quest locations with staffing for either short-term or long-term employment opportunities.The BOL Healthy Houston Collective includes an FQHC collaboration with charity clinics to provide greater access to quality healthcare. By adding a larger and more diverse network of FQHC partners, the BOL Community Health Workers will be able to support patient social needs to help improve health engagement and outcomes.In response to providing grassroots community-based programs that align with the larger community needs, the BOL Healthy Houston Collective is also adding a CBO Regranting Program to support nutrition and behavioral health services. According to the Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research, more than 500,000 Houstonians live in food deserts, or low-income areas where the nearest grocery store in an urban area is more than a mile away. One of the CBO Regrants that will target senior citizens facing this issue is a partnership with Lucille's 1913. Lucille's 1913 operates as a non-profit entity, and their ""Better Measure Program"" will provide nutritious meals to 100 homebound seniors during a 90-day period. Community health workers along with other health professionals will visit the homes of those in the program to identify barriers, conduct diagnostic tests and collect data to gauge the effectiveness of the program.""We are proud to be a part of this important initiative and have the opportunity to provide nutritious meals for homebound seniors to help improve their health,"" said Dr. Robertine Jefferson, CEO, Lucille's 1913. ""Our program includes delivering culturally relevant meals to best support diverse communities in a way that recognizes their backgrounds and empowers them to choose healthy options that align with their traditions and cultural preferences.""The BOL Healthy Houston Collective is partnering with the following professional entities supporting the four areas of this program: University of Houston Community Health Worker Initiative; Professional Healthcare Education Services; Eco-Life Staffing; Avenue 360 Health and Wellness (FQHC); Vecino Health Center; Christ Clinic; Lucille's 1913; and the Community Care Cooperative.About Healthy Houston Collective, A Project of Bread of Life, Inc.St. John's Church was established in 1992 under the leadership of Pastors Rudy and Juanita Rasmus with a simple mission to serve hot nutritious meals to homeless men and women in the downtown Houston area. In 1994, the church formed the Bread of Life, Inc. (BOL), a non-profit organization that provides a full spectrum of services and addresses inequities impacting individuals and families living in Houston and the surrounding area. Nearly 30 years later, BOL is still focused on supporting underserved communities and restoring hope in Houston through its program areas. BOL has had a huge impact in the Bayou City in the expanse of homelessness, hunger, disaster relief, as well as boosting health outcomes and continues to help create an improved quality of life for the people of Houston.

The final tournament, held at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, CA, named Ashley Shaw and Roman Solomon the respective winners of the girls' and boys' Curry Cup titles, and were crowned the UNDERRATED Golf tour champions.UNDERRATED GOLFOver the last few months, the mission-based enterprise has created opportunities for young athletes who may not otherwise have the chance to gain access to the sport and adjacent skills, by working with corporate partners and sponsors to provide training, equipment, networking events and more. This endeavor also allows young golfers to play on courses they would never have access to, all the while addressing the gender inequity within the sport of golf and beyond, ensuring young female players are given the same opportunities as their male counterparts.""Golf has always been one of the most powerful vehicles to spark professional and social conversations,"" said Stephen Curry. ""We've designed UNDERRATED Golf to do the same for underrepresented individuals who have never had true access to the sport, or the opportunity to receive the benefits that come with it. However, UNDERRATED Golf is so much more than just the sport. This special program is prioritizing off-course endeavors including special seminars that focus on a multitude of disciplines, with an emphasis on business ethics and various career opportunities across the golf industry and far beyond. Furthermore, our corporate partners have had a large hand in making the golf program all the more impactful for these athletes.""Story continuesUNDERRATED Golf kicked-off its inaugural season in April with 136 junior golfers to compete in regional tournaments. In support of the tour, like-minded corporations poured time, money and resources into making this experience all the more worthwhile for these athletes. Best-in-class equipment for the golfers was provided by Callaway Golf, while transportation to the various golf clubs, including the final tournament at Curry Cup, was facilitated by United Airlines, and other impactful donations were made by CDW, Cisco, Google, 2K Foundations and Stephen's own Curry Brand with Under Armour.Off the field, UNDERRATED Golf is advancing the lives of underrepresented communities outside of the sport, by creating an off-season curriculum for these same young athletes to take part in educational and career-building courses via Stephen's soon to be launched ""Curry Academy."" Beyond Curry Cup, all brand partners and sponsors will have a stake in the curriculum, whether it be through mentorships, internships, teaching seminars or experiential activations. Wiz Kid Learning, one of North America's leading coding &amp; STEM education providers, will assist in developing a handful of these educational programs.""Every single one of our brand partners has had an integral role in the success of this program, whether behind the scenes or first-hand,"" said Will Lowery, UNDERRATED Golf Professional and Tour Ambassador. ""We wouldn't be able to accomplish nearly as much with the tour, and certainly not the curriculum that's happening postseason, without their financial and in-kind support, resources and overall guidance.""Looking ahead, UNDERRATED Golf will grow the participant pool each year, ultimately having a global footprint with the world's best prospects and building on the success of UNDERRATED as a whole.UNDERRATED is a culmination of Curry's inspiring journey to the top as he defied the odds, breaking basketball stereotypes and reminding people that being the best is not about being the strongest, fastest and tallest, but about being grounded in your potential, committed to your craft and, ultimately, undeterred.Please click here for the quote bank provided by UNDERRATED Golf's corporate partners.About UNDERRATED UNDERRATED is an inspiring lifestyle brand with a mission to empower underrated and underrepresented individuals all over the world.
